I  ve done it once at the Sharq Village & Spa ... It  s great
Dear , All ! Please read question before you are writing answer ! i was n t asking where I can do massage !!! I asked about oil ! As for second answer - I  m searching oil for body massage . Bought one in Canterpoint , there is a small shop near sports shop , and that oil has nice smell , but ! It  s not for making massage to anyone !
Again ... I  m happy for you that you have oil ?! Did you read my question ?! I have a lots of things , but I  m not writing here about it !!! Do n t be stupid , people , read before you write something !!! I have question , need answer directly to this question , not your empty answers about nothing !
You might be able to find Body Massage Oil in Body Shop at Landmark or City Centre , and if they do have it there , its guaranteed to be good for massage , as some places sell duplicates , so watch out as this could cause allergies to the skin . Good Luck !
Hi . According to your body nature in your picture !!!!!!!! I advise you to use car oil any type forever like my car . It is helpfull to maintaine your body brigthness .
Oh SORRY . Iam stupied also , your ? WHERE ? My answer is in PETROL STATIONS ... ...
thanks , but where can i get english format visa extension form ??
iphone 4
chief tailor i think he already get yuor message ... once is enough .
Boyfriend cant . But as a husband he can apply for visit visa for both of you .
Yep Boyfriend can not sponsor you but if he becomes your husband then he can . .
As far as i know you need to show a proof as a marriage certificate when applying as you have to show your proof of relationship .
your nationality plays a major role here . coz there r certain citizenships who can get on arrival visas just from the airport on arrival . if u r from one of those countries , u do n t have any problem . just buy the tickets , come down here , get the visa from the airport on arrival BUT YOUR CITIZENSHIP ... . !!!!!
we want to get married there in Qatar once we arrive there . . its this possible ? I was told that he can apply for visit visa for me and our son . . He wants us to get married in Qatar
Dear , Why dont you let your boy friend arrange the things for you if he really wants to marry you here . The process would be long and lots of documentations needed . I have a friend who got married here -LRB- no child -RRB- lots of documentation needed and takes long time to get their marriage certificate issued and therefore she had to fly back to her home country waiting for the attestation of the marriage certificate . Once it is done , then waiting for family visa to be processed . So get yourself ready for all the process . Good luck for your wedding .
thanks for your answers but I really would like some help on this . We want to get married in Qatar . The fact that we are getting married there is it not proof enough for Qatari officials to know that we will be legal and enough requirement for us to stay with my fiance in his house ? We were supposed to get married here in the Philippines but he did n t have time for us to set the wedding here . . Thanks again !
much easier to get a civil married first then apply for the visa , this way you can stay with him legally with no worries at all
since u specifically about NEXT then the prices r the same ... except that here u dont get EVERYTHING u find over in the UK but we do have most of the British stores.We have Debanhams , M&S , BHS and Next.But over all 1000 is way to much to pay ... depending on how much clothes you have ... or need ... i would humbly suggest that u evaluate yr clothes because u know the prices , u alone will be able to judge if the money will buy u what u decide to leave behind ... Good luck
I  m kinda particular about and partial to my clothing so I brought mine . The choices here are not infinite and there is n t the catelog shopping available either .
If you already have clothes then it  s infinitely cheaper to bring them than to buy more !
I would just want to reiterate that prices are MUCH higher here . For example yesterday in M&S looked at a pair of trousers , UK price 29.50 , Qatar price 200QR , which means about 38 sterling at the current rates . Next I have found to be even worse than this . At another shop bought my son some Clarks sandles costing 245QR which would have been 30 in the UK . Talk about mark up ! I would also say that the range of clothing to the average UK taste is quite limited . As soon as you go outside of the UK shops you can run into some rather ornate clothing . The quality can be questionable aswell . Not sure how the higher end international shops compare . I am currently counting down the days til I go back to the UK in the summer and hit the summer sales ! Planning on going with empty cases and coming back with rather full ones LOL .
have u signed any contract ? if u have , check what is stipulated there . . sometimes , employers require the employee to pay a certain amount of fee if he she resigns before the probationary period , but you did n t mention how long you  ve been working with the company . .
the problem is ... expenses
like getting banned for 2 years > Is that right ?
you can resign and go back
BEst Place is Qatarliving ofcourse
u r already in the best place ... advertize here in QL
it might take awhile to sell a dodge car nowadays and if you are looking for a best sell place i do n t suggest you to park your car in one of those car shops at salwa roads , it take awhile to be noticed , so your best bet to find car showrooms inside doha or add your car at http:  qatarsale.com by contacting them and they will do the rest
try these sites , www dot qatarsale dot com and www dot qatarcl dot com ... good luck
Approach Oasis Used Cars . . they are the best . Location near Crazy signal dial 111 to get the contact number .
salwa road has a lot of cars showrooms also . let me tell you something , if you like adventures just go to Industrial Area - Street No. 10 , on thursdays and fridays :-RRB- , you will find your self in Cars Souq alot of cars , alot of people :-RRB- . . but if u go there and you was upset . . its not my fault : -RRB-
which car do you have ?
come on all just clear out my doubt
should have been under family sponsorship . thats the only visa i think which is extensible upto 6 months . Anyways , the person has to wait 3 months to come back .
After Three Months .
Moths will not help you being here at all . They are fluttery creatures that destroy cloth . I doubt any moth will help you at all . To be puerile though and living up to the persona some have created for me on QL . I will say this , ca n t answer your question as I do n t have a problem with travel as I am English and as much as we are ` hated   by some we can travel anywhere we like .
http:  www.qatarliving.com answers living-in-qatar any-hindu-temple write temple on the search at the right hand side u will find many threads on this topic ... ... ...
Qatar is basically an islamic country and they see asian expats as slaves and nothi8ng more . So u may see churches here but you wont find temples . And idol worship is not allowed in islam . Hence you wont find temples here . I hope one day qatar changes the attitude of seeing asians as slaves .
Shayampsundar ... . . You are prejudiced against Qatar ... ... . . why not you leave this country if your religious sentiments are being bashed ... as you claim !! Asians are slave ??????????? Are you treating yourself as a leader of again community here . Beware such statements can lead to your deportation also ... . . i know you are still a kid -LRB- based on your profile -RRB- ... . but refrain from unworthy comments ... . otherwise this would lead to problem for your parents who are earning their livelihood here and feeding you !!!
SHYAM SUNDER ... are they treating u as a slave or do u consider yourself to be a rotten slave ... coz i do not think that any one here has bothered to chain ur legs to some shackles here and kept u bonded ... u are here just for your some meaningful gains and u are making yourself a slave to the country . . like any respect a human being deserves everyone has the freedom to choose to stay or go away from a place he likes or dislikes ... so if u do not like the systems here y the hell are u making urself a slave or a DOG over here ... get lost man to ur own country and iam sure wherever u go u will definitely treat others as slaves . . so cheers
shayampsundar , u have the right to speak out and give ur comment or suggestion but u should respect Qatar or the relegion Islam!by giving comments to ur brother ... if somebody treated u as slave do n t generalized all the locals or Qatari we all know most indians was lazy and trying hard they think that they know everything but we know that their really something talkative and staburn ...

Lexus is better .
If you can afford the IS F . There is nothing like it .
infiniti G35 anytime ...
Take it from me i have rode on both cars before , both are luxurious , both have fast acclerations and both looking pretty nice . Lexus IS 300 has more functions in it and doesnt need much of a modification since it already looks hot as stock but Infinity G35 can be modified nicely to be just as mean as Lexus . So the choice is yours . Good Luck

Go to 51 East -LRB- either in City Centre or in Al Maha near Jarir -RRB- . They are the agents of Rolex and will have technicians .
as aby said these are motion watches ... .
Rolex agent is Modern home , u must take advice from them , according to advice u have to take dession . Secundly your watch is not aut . Best of luck .
This is a common finding when first starting to use a rolex ... i panicked when i first got mine and took it back to the dealer as it stopped as i took it off over night the first time i got it ... wear it on for a few days then it wont stop if u leave it overnight but it would stop if u leave it for a couple of days though ... enjoy it
<P> Im a fan of designer watches , I usually buy rolex , omega , and other luxury watches at http:  www.cheap-rolex-shop.com  http:  www.cheaprolexshop.com  http:  www.buycheaprolexwatches.net  my love watch shops offer the excellent quality and decent price , if youre willing to , you can visit them . < P>
PHILIPPINO lady for a massage ??

So you are looking for a message !!! hmmmm i dont recommend any one of them , i went once and i was going to xxxxx with that semi guy , they all are shemales belive me , so if u r looking for that go ahead otherwise there is the only one who is the decent at al saad street , it is after al saad plaza if you are coming from the new traffic light near the BMW , it is called kotakel something like that . Good luck
good facial centres spas , try marriott or ritz , they have a lovely spa , but expensive . a new place opened up opp city centre , its called bio something.they too specialise in the same stuff.again expensive . lady siam centre near toys r us , alsadd area , is good too.they specialise in thai massages and stuff and their facial is really nice and soothing . had it long time back , but communiacting with them is difficult as they speak only thai and broken english . massage , you can try chinese reflexology massage at ramada , that good too , also the kottakal massage centre in muntaza area , cheap and good for body pains and stuff.both are priced at aprox 100qrs . almost all saloons do facials and some have real extensive range of facials.u need to try out the places to get a feel of it . i just saw your profile , you sound so much like me , except the coke and margarita part .
Hi all is there any Phillipino lady makes Good message in Home either for men or for women . . Kindly Send mail to killer_mllr@yahoo.com with the charges to be mentioned also . . thanks ... ... ... ...

The massage itself is ok , not excellent , but ok . The overall experience is not the best - can never reach them on the phone , the receptionist is not very friendly , not punctual . Another words if you are looking for the experience , this is not the place to go .

Recommended that place ... -LRB- owned by my thai girlfriend -RRB- . Their facial are very good and their aromatherapy alot better than Marriot massage .
I like professional sport massage , specialy after a fitness session , and the masseur at ramada is good ; ok also the indian kotakel , the philipino on najima I found depressing and not clean -LRB- male section at least -RRB- . And , as far as I know , there are always masseur for men and masseuse for ladied , this to avoid expectations . Anybody tried the british massage therapist -LRB- his ads chilloutnow in QL -RRB- ?
how much the charged for the massage at the back only ??? ... not a whole body massage ... if there  s any ... where is that place to be ??? ... thanks

even if you go to al ahli after delivery you will be referred to hamad for further proceedings ... birth certificate , immunization etc. . better go to hamad inshallah everything will be fine ... to go to ahli is to simply increase your expenses ...
Al Ahli is the best if u have insurance . I just delivered 6 months back there and was well taken care of . Hamad has limited number of beds in the labour room and some times u have to wait your turn !!!!
Best is Doha clinc hospital and Dr Maha yehia Mohmoud best gynac
As i understand Hamad is a government hospital , and Doha clinic is private , is that right ? and if so , is it always private better than government ? in concerning caring and experience of doctors , right ?
you will only pay 100 QR per day in hamad . . that  s all . . everything is free . . even if C-section is going to be performed only room charge 100 QR day is going to be paid by the patient . . the shorter she stays in hamad the cheaper it gets ... my wife delivered our third baby in 2010 in hamad ... now even if i have AXA insurance i will still consider hamad when my wife delivers our next baby in 3 weeks from now . . that is because i am very much satisfied with hamad ... best service at lowest cost ...
hamad hosp will charge 200 QR per day for visit visa pregnant women who will deliver their babies ... check hamad women  s hospital for more info ...
no they wont . Aana free , jaana free , Pakde gaye tho khana free .
i think they are not hiring the married females ... its there policy ... And by chance if you will be selected . . they will not sponsor your son ... Cheers !!!

yep!love it ... are u planning to put up a zagu business here ? ; -RRB-
Is n't it a food franchise in Philippines ? The franchise owner would be happy to know about your idea but I believe there are some business issues to hurdle first when franchising in foreign countries . Starting a ZAGU concept here wither franchise or personal is feasible . Guts and understanding the government business operations in Qatar are essentials . Customer satisfaction and profitability come next . For sure , we are your `` SUKI '' regular customers . Our family love to hear , we got one `` Orig ' l PINOY ! '' in DOHA .

i Already checked the kababayan supermarket . but they dont have globe roaming sim there . only smart . i 'm using smart now just for temporary . Smart can not be called but i 'm not sure of it . My gf is globe and its too expensive for her to text to my smart because it will cost her 2php every text . Everytime my gf call me it cost her . . 20php per 1min . uhmm . . Maybe I 'll try to find globe sim in souq . I hope i could get one there . Globe has a good signal here too . When i arrived here im using globe roaming sim . and its ok but it was been deactivated last thursday because my load dind ` nt catch up . ehehe!Thank you !! ill try to check the stores again there or if i cant really find one here . . maybe i 'll just ask my friends in phil who are going here in qatar . Thanks again ! btw are you all filipino ? ^_^
i didnt see any globe sim in filipino souq ... there are lots of smart sim available in souq . .
simangot , i suggest your GF switch to smart sim in pinas . I will tell you some encouragement and ideas . And advantages and disadvantages of both Globe and Smart . Here it goes : With SMART , you dont have to load everyday or every week just to maintain your sim or be activated . you can do SmartLoad or Over The Air Reload once in 3 Months . The sim will be deactivated within 120 days of NO LOAD . 1 Peso text from Pinas to Internatioal Roaming Sim . Smart Signal is also good in Doha . In industrial Area is good , why not in the city . :-RRB- With GLOBE , you have to maintain a LOAD everytime for the rest of your life in abroad . Much Expensive . With Smart , when activated as Roaming Sim , Pure Text only . While Globe , you can receive make calls but it 's expensive . International Rate Charges Apply . If you happen to buy that Globe OFW Sim , it 's a BULL ! They said on the TV Commercials that no maintaining balance for 1 year or Forever , i dont remember anymore . It 's not True ! you still have to reload within 1 month of use . I guess you are working here in Doha , right ? I bet you talk to your GF at night or after work or in the morning . Why do n't you buy QTEL Sim from QTEL Offices . It 's only 50QR now , i think they still have this Promo going on . Or better yet , there is this internet calls located in Doha . Maybe its in Souq or Industrial Area . 1 minute is to 1QR . Cheaper than using your QTEL SIm to call Pinas for 1.85 QR per minute .
GLOBE FAMILY SIM PACK comes with 1PC OFW PREACTIVATED ROAMING SIM and 2PCS FAMILY SIM sold at PHP120 .00 only available at designated retail outlets in the Philippines . u would easily find it while processing some of ur papers at POEA Ortigas . Family Sim can text and call the OFW Sim at a cost of philippine local standard SMS and Calling charges . The OFW sim remains still active even at a zero load balance while abroad provided , however , any of the family sim must use the facility of SMS or calling at a time not exceeding within a month period . Anyhow , anyone of the Family Sim dont have any SMS or calling activity within a month to an OFW SIM , the service shall be automatically deactivated . Likewise , the OFW sim lost its special service capabilities . The OFW SIM will be then regarded as ordinary SIM . >
why stick to Globe ? A lots of Smart Roaming SIM is available in Souq Area . Electronic loading is also available there . EOF0825

Most of people prefer Karwa driving school . As registration process is swift . I heard from my fellas there is some offerfor full course , but your enrollment will come after 1 month .
Gulf driving school offers the best chance of you getting your licence among all the driving schools . It is popular because of the high success rate . The teaching however is terrible . So if you really want to learn driving , go to some other place . If you just want the licence , you can try gulf driving school

I see a lot of people are walking in City Centre area in the evenings and weekends .

Life is unsafe in general . . so . .

I happen to know first hand . . factors such as age , education and earnings for the past 12 mths of the applicant will be alloted ` points ' and if he she meets the minimum points for this visa category then its not a problem at all . You will have to apply from outside the UK for this , even if you are currently residing there under a different visa category . What do you want to know specifically ? ~ Live like there 's no tommorrow ~
Thanks for your reply Pin , have u applied before for this type of visa ? i would like to know how easy i can be accepted and how long it takes to know if i will be granted this visa . . please advise
yes , i have been working and living in london for more than 1 year under a highly skilled migrant programme -LRB- HSMP -RRB- and i subsequently switched to Tier 1 -LRB- General -RRB- . bear in mind - i got my visa way before the uk recession and jobs were easy to come by . now unemployment is a big issue here . you wo n't be able to renew the tier 1 visa without a skilled job . anyways , it is unlawful to reject your application if you : - 1 -RRB- have met the minimum 75 points 2 -RRB- can proof that you meet the required English standard 3 -RRB- have minimum funds of GBP2800 . 4 -RRB- obviously , you must not have any prior criminal convictions or have previously abused your immigration status -LRB- i.e. overstayed on a visa , outstanding fines in uk , etc -RRB- do n't bother applying if you do n't meet the above . for me , application to approval took 3 weeks , applying from KL , Malaysia . for precise requirements and how points are calculated , see http:  www.ukvisas.gov.uk en howtoapply infs inf21pbsgeneralmigrant#6375036 good luck . ~ Live like there 's no tommorrow ~
i am so lucky to have your advice , knowing that u went through the same procedures before . what do u mean `` you wo n't be able to renew the tier 1 visa without a skilled job '' . actually i am not renewing , and do they gauge their approval by the required profession on top of the ones u mentioned . did u validate ur degrees with NARIC , any advice here ? must be the bank statement not older than 7 days or it is fine to be a bit older ? i have applied TOEFLE for more than 5 years ago , do they take this into consideration ? please advise , thanks v much indeed
the tier 1 general visa is for 24 months only . to extend your stay beyond 24 months you must renew it . you wo n't be able to do so without a job . as far as i know , you must have at least a bachelor 's degree and that 's how they accept that you are ` highly skilled ' . they want ORIGINAL documents , no copies . do n't worry they will return these to you . bank statements - latest 3 months showing minimum of GBP2800 and must be original as well . TOEFL is accepted , marks must be 110-120 -LRB- internet based test -RRB- . you must also provide the original cert and test scores . ~ Live like there 's no tommorrow ~
do u think that they accept notarized copy of my certificates and not original ones ? is it possible to get ur email for future correspondence ? thanks so much , you have been v helpful to me
greatly appreciated
I recommend buying them Melatonin . I started using it 3 weeks ago . I get sleepy soon after taking 2 and I have a great sleep . I do n't wake up with that lingering tiredness that something like , say , Panadol Night , does . The pharmacy opposite Carrefour in Villagio definitely has it for about QR36 and I 'm sure you 'll find it at other pharmacies -LRB- no prescription needed of course -RRB- . Best of luck !
http:  www.childdevelopmentinfo.com health_safety child_teen_sleep.htm do n't use medication without asking DR.
Dont let them sleep for a day in the morning.at night they will fall asleep.continue this for a week.they will get used.don ' t ever change the sheddule time.put them on bed on time.Let them be entertained during day time.and not allow at night . If they are toddlers they usually dose ` nt want to sleep.they try to experience the surroundings.Make them to understand that night is to sleep or rest.Don ' t use lights which are bright.try not to use or a very mild power.don ' t encourage them at night to talk play have snacks . . etc.So they 'll feel the night boaring and they automatically go to sleep . Try some bedtime stories.give them a bed time and never ever change it.Be stricked on the rule.I think it will work out surely .
addict for playing games on gadgets , is one of the reason also , so it should be limit or qiuet to avoid . 2nd , discipline from a parent is the best way , `` mother 's knows best '' best regards !!

please use this link - ` http:  www.dohamap.info map
Go to any stationery shop and buy one ! There 's also a good one in Marhaba
the Qatar guidebook called Marhaba has an excellent map -LRB- although it 's hard to keep maps here updated as there is always lots of construction and you do n't know when the road you used yesterday will close or disappear -RRB- . The Doha Ritz hotel stocks the same maps for guests , I bet if you went to the Ritz in KL they would have one inter-officed to you ! Good luck !

Buy only this brand `` Del Monte Pineapple '' it 's 100 % pure and fresh and no artificial flavors . It 's stored in a big can .
try KABAYAN in souq
I would recommend Del Monte Pineapple juice available in most hypermarket and Kabayan Stores .
If not satisfied with Del Monte , best option is to buy fresh Pineapple and make at home .

go to jarir bookstore they sell those cards called CashU . but they work on some internet sites . go check it out . before buying go to cashu.com and check if the site you want buy from has it .
I am really looking to find a solution for buying online localy in Qatar or from internet such as Amazoon.com . I heared that one banke issuing such cards @ 500 QR , and they deduct 50 QR service and you can buy up to 450 QR . But I did n't try to find that Bank
QNB use to do it . . but now they make it for only CC holders u can check with THE GROUP or Doha bank
Using ATM card would be great , but it is not safe . I addition to that who asked this quastion dont have an bank account .
If any body can advice QNB and Doha Bank Tel. . No . to call them and aske to get better informations and Details

I suggest PS3 . . its a complete entertainment station , not only for gaming but also for : * watching DIVX movies and Bluray and many other format . * Store your photos on the system and view them with a nifty album format . . * Connect to your PC for sharing * Connect to your PSP if you have one * Play MP3 and other format songs and many more ... An do not forget the variety of awesome games on the shelves now , and some popular ones are under discounted price . Just my opinion Regards

The cost of buying 1000 Qmiles directly from Qatar Airways is QR 120 . You should accept no less than QR 80 per 1000 . Many people would want to spend money on transfer , rather they want you to go with them to the Qatar Airways office to permit the use of the Qmiles you agreed on , they will pay you the agreed amount , and pay Qatar Airways the taxes and other fees .
`` Many people would <b> NOT < b> want to spend money on transfer ''
Hi , Are u still interested in selling Qmiles ?
hi can i purchase your 70,000 qmiles . . please call me 70013890

Hi Airlines will not charge you extra for a car seat and travel cot . I have travelled the UK , South Africa and Switzerland and I have always been able to take my stroller , car seat and travel cot with me at no extra charge . Phone the airline and find out !
Definitely phone the airline . The baggage rules have changed a LOT and we nearly got stung for US$ 525 for three bags earlier this month . As recently as October 2008 you could fly from the U.S. to Doha on Qatar Airways without the carseats counting toward your baggage requirement at all . In other words , you were allowed two bags per passenger ... so if there were two adults and two -LRB- paying -RRB- kids then you were allowed eight bags PLUS the two car seats . But no longer ... now you would be allowed six bags plus two car seats . Anything over that costs US$ 175 * per bag * . We learned this the hard way , so it 's not an urban legend for us :-LRB-
Oh - and to answer your question -LRB- sorry ` bout that ! -RRB- I am not aware of any companies that hire them out . Car seats , in particular , are generally not used outside of the expatriate crowd . :-LRB- You can find what you need at the City Center Babyshop store , but depending on your luggage situation it might just make sense to bring it with you .
imposible !
I suggest you to go to http:  www.qatarliving.com node 617041 where you will get information concerning gluten free food .

i would go for 18,000 provided that car is in good running condition . .
abt dis car shd wht will b ??? Please spell correctly , not in shorthand . I sometimes write this way when I 'm taking notes in meetings , but I would fix it when I get to my office .
some people try to be too `` fashionable '' by writing this type of shorthand . i know a teenage girl who writes to me emails `` hi aunty , dis dat abt '' etc etc , , , , That is OK ... but I was shocked one day , when her father in 50 + , tried to write such language !!!! it is just another hypocirsy of some Indians , having studied in Indian shcool , suddenly start wrting `` I GOT TA GO , , YOU WAN NA IT ? '' ... . . such US slangs !!!!
first do a computer test to see the current condition of vehicle and then decide !!

You can now check your eligibility for a Bahrain visa online by visiting the link http:  www.evisa.gov.bh 3 , 7 and 14 days visas are issued online for all Nationalities .

if the wife is under the sponsorship of his husband he can freely tranfer to any company .
can she works with gov under her husband sponsring as well ?
better to follow the terms in the Labor Law regarding terminating a contract by either party .
Well , it 's a bit more complex than that . If she gets a job that allows her to stay under her husband 's sponsorship she can change without an NOC . Some jobs require you be under their sponsorship . Mandi
Anyone ?
thanks ... a lot .
it seems difficult 4rth time the transfer of sponsorship , thrice is ordinary . but if u have some reliable source -LRB- wasta -RRB- in immigration , would be ok then . even if current company let you free to work anywhere , but immigration might be an obstacle .
It 's fine dear ... as long as you pay for it , it 's ok ... you can change sponsorships as mush as you want as long as you have NOC . I myself changed 5 times . So no worries ...
Consular services for Greek nationals Cyprus Embassy in Doha is represents the consular interests and diplomatic protection of Greek nationals who live and work in Qatar since there is no Greek Embassy in the country . Greek nationals can certify documents , signatures and ask for a permanent resident certificate . The price for the certifications is 5 -LRB- around QR40 depending on exchange rate -RRB- Also Cyprus Embassy keeps a mailing list where Greeks and Cypriots who live and work in Qatar are encouraged to register . The mailing list is updated daily and every effort is made for the best accuracy . The Embassy distributes security information when necessary and other important information to the registered nationals . The Greek Ambassador to Qatar is the Ambassador of Greek Embassy in Kuwait . Since Cyprus has not started issuing shengen visas yet , visa applications for Greece are being processed by the Embassy of France . For more information please contact the consular section of the Embassy . check this link , http:  www.mfa.gov.cy mfa Embassies Embassy_Doha.nsf All 85D1B7B79AB8FFFE432571D4002E8729?OpenDocument

It is near Inter Continental hotel .
It had recently opened and the prime minister of the Greece was here for the last 3 days , it is near Intercontinental Hotel Roundabout , go to the left from the RB and then first right , you will find a sign for Greek Embassy , Bahrain Embassy and Chouefat School -LRB- Sabis -RRB- the information below about the Cyprus embassy is old and obselete
The first answer is outdated - it should be deleted . There is a Greek embassy in Qatar and its hours are 10-12 daily except Fridays . Location Opposite the Doha exibition center . If you are driving from City Center and make a U-turn at the Doha Exibition Center Round about . In about 400 meters make a right turn . Once you made the right , follow through - maybe the second right and another right till you see some vans belonging to a construction office . You will find the Greek Embassy close to them . 412 8150 Greek Embassy Phone Number
From what I know , you will be ban from Qatar if your employment did not give a release and you will have to wait for at least two years to go back to Qatar .
if you get the no objection certificate from current sponsor u can enter in doha with valid visa
your sponsor can ban you for lifetime ,5 years and minimum 2 years . this 2 year ban is by govt.it is common for anybody who cancel rp and went out.more than 2 yrs ban your sponsor have to show solid reason to mini of interior and it is very hard for employers . now if you want to return before 2 years , noc is requried from old sponsor.if you carry noc with you at time of dept , it need to be endorsed by immigration and this endorsement will expire automaticaly after 6 months.in that case your new employer have to get another one to get your new visa . but wait , , , , , , , which visa are you?some type of visa does not need 2 years bar .
If u hv NOC U can come , make sure you Get ur RP cancelled by your current company before leaving , make sure you have not crossed 3 months of Expiry of RP . Why do n't you get sponsorship changed since U have release . GOOD LUCK !!!
actually my papers are in the labor dept. we are applying for my change of sponsorship we were rejected twice , the reason is the immigration imposed a new rule that company sponsorship transferred to husband sponsorship are not allowed or vice versa . . now my visa is expired and i need to go back home that 's why i am asking if i will go back home will i be able to come back here in qatar after my 2 months vacation , by the way i have my NOC w   me and release paper from my previous company .
i love it . . :-RRB- -RRB-
how can you `` claim '' one ?
i am not sure if there is any penalty but they tell you if you dont collect within 30 Days the number plate is scrapped and you will have to pay for the plates again , i think its 250 QAR for two . But try to go back to the traffic department just incase your plate is still there you can say you went out on holidays or so . . just give it a shot ...
There is no penalty but you have to apply again for a new plate .
thanks for your comments . yes , there was no penalty but we paid for the new plate .
Dating is n't an issue , its having a sexual relationship that is the issue . I think jail would come into it if one of the parties was married . Still , could be worse , its stoning in some other countries !
well yes , if they find you kissing or _____ in public or even in room -LRB- if some one saw you and complain -RRB- so better be careful . dating is not a issue , doing something nasty will bring trouble for you . so Ms strawberry , u can go for date ...

Be different . I will hoist that up the flag pole and see who salutes it !!
many thanks for your valued support but as usual books are heavy around 8-9 kgs total . if i use postal am sure i will end up paying a huge charges any other alternative . .
well , then i guess you could check and see who is coming to qatar from dubai , and request them to get the books for you . but to be honest , i do n't think anyone would be willing to fill in 8-9 kgs of their own luggage space , just to get books for someone else ! , thinkin this way , you might find the shipment option more helpful ! you might have to do a little homework on checking out which shipment companies gives you the best price , and instruct the seller sender accordingly :-RRB- alternately , try looking for those books in qatar , i.e. in jarir bookstore .
ani chy has given you the right answer . If you dont want to spend money on shipping charges you should find someone who is coming from U.A.E and also willing to take you 9kg load free of charge but most probably a very difficult way .

gratuity -40 days of basic salary he will get , since he worked 4 years .
Per Qatar labor laws : 21 days basic salary is gratuity for each year worked . 4 year * 21 days * last daily basic pay = Gratuity Amount
1-calculation of gratuity as per qatar labor law is 21 days basic salary of each year . if u worked 5 years or more it will become 1 month basic salary instead of 21 days . 2 . Each year u have a right to get 21 days leave salry , if u not get in previous years , u can claim for this also . 3 . All of the calculation based on the last basic salary u got . Eg . suppose on the time of ur joining ur basic salary is 5000 and now u r getting the basic salary 7500 , the calculation is based on the last one measns 7500 . 4 . If ur contract is defenit contract u should give 2 weeks notice informing ur resignation . if ur contact is indefinit duration contact u must give 1 month notice about ur resignation . other wise they can deduct 1 month salary or remaining balance of days salary from ur settlement .
he will get only gratuity that 21 days per year as per the last drawn basic , apart from that legally nothing
Hello Queenritz ! Although the accommodation and transportation is provided , the offer is really lame and you 'll see that wo n't be enough for your monthly expenses . Good luck !
if you spend it moderately then , 750qr is enough for the whole month food and other expense . you can save upto 2000qr , if you spend the money correctly .
Very Bad Offer , keep trying better luck next time .
can u tell which school u will join u can earn some money by tution also if it is bright future pakisatani school then it is good
This to Nasim ... lol u made me laugh truely . . he said QR .2750 Means clear enogh he will spend qatari reyals . . wat QR .750 for his food and and wat other expenses -LRB- intrnet , tel , laundry , etc. . -RRB- and save QR .2000 be realist man no matter how u moderat and tighten ur self unless u meant to spend QR .2000 and SAVE QR .750 !!??? . . lol ... are u replying from india or where else on the moon . my dear it 's too low rate . . try to negotiate harder it doesnt worth . . unless u desperatly u need ajob
you are young and i guess its your first time to work abroad . go for it , do n't expect much . when u grow and get the experience , then you can bargain for best offer . GOODLUCK !
2750 is too much for you . tell the management to reduce salary range 1500 to 1750 , then they will definitely agree with you and you should think that teaching profession is not for money , its a charity too ...
It would be enough but not satisfactory . Just do your job very well and soon you can ask for an increase . Regards
all good housemaids will be employed by good families ... now all available are good for nothing . !!!
Hmmm ... your probably better off going to that pet shop and purchasing one of those Baboons . Good luck , if you find the answer please , post it .
You only know by try and error start with 3 months hire and see if good take it if not changed
14,500 is a good salary and the bonus is a plus , u will be paying the rent per month for a 2 Bedroom fully furnished apartment between 7000 to 8000 QR , around 300 for water and electricity bills , then monthly budget for groceries approx . 1000 to 1500 . so all in all maximum 10,000 QR , so will be saving around 5,000 QR at least.u can save more depending on the life style u choose . life in qatar is good , peaceful , free of worries . so do n't worry take a chance , its a good opportunity .
You can find 1BHK semi furnished brand new flats including water and electricity in Doha at Qrs 3500-4000 per month . Grocery , 1000 - 1500 Qrs . Petrol and other maintenances , 300-500 if you have an economy car in good condition . Telephone and internet , 250-500 . So total monthly expense will come around 6500 - 7000 maximum . You can save half of your salary if you have a good plan . Good luck go ahead this is a good job offer if the company and project is real .
For single it is okay . But for married you wo n't be saving anything . 1000-1500 living expenses is good for one person only . House rent and food will eat most of your salary . Transportation or car maintenance and education fees is an additional burden to your meagre salary .
Thanks for your inputs.Felt this is a good salary by Asian Standards .
i dont see anybody died here with a salary of 1000QR ... depends on your lifestyle ...
Yes it 's more than good and you do n't have a family so easily you can pay your home rent and your car Car payments , the rest of your salary you can do some shopping and spend a good time with friends
How did he get a Qatari Driving License -LRB- permanent -RRB- without having a Residence Permit and ID ?
cherukkan , He might have got the temporary DL and is confused . They will not issue Permanent DL without RP and ID . A person on visit visa will not have a Permanent DL of Qatar and will not be able to buy a car .
please get your facts straight as you can not get a Permanent Drivers License without an RP . The license is link to your QID and bear the same number .
the license is connected to the Qatari ID . . if the visa is cancelled the license will have no meaning as well . . he is driving at his own risk similar to not having a license . . if he gets a new sponsor and gets a new qatari id he will again need to apply for a new license to be linked to that new ID .
Dohamarketing is right . You do n't need a Driving License to buy a car but you need an RP to buy a car . His Driving License is invalid as his visa was cancelled and he should renew it after obtaining the RP .

Perfume is a personal matter . It depends on your personality , your look , your mood and especially on your environement -LRB- they are the ones who gon na smell it -RRB- . The perfume you wear at a party may be very inappropriate at work . You should be careful as well beacause some people may have `` allergies '' . Go with you feeling .
what he loves on me : Givenchy Very Irresistable and Bulgari Omnia . what i love on him : RL Polo Black and Givenchy Neo .
If you are trying to give someone a gift , ask one of her friend . Perfumes comes in different smell to different people and there are perfumes that are nice for hot weather and some in cold .
Hmm ... if you want to have a perfume in z low cost then i would say DOUBLE HORSe or France CLUB N if u want to in moderate ones the ni say VERSACE , PORCHE design , 1001 nights -LRB- atar -RRB- , HUGO or BOSS
It differs in taste from person to person . .

<p> you need to have a valid passport of six months when you travel ! It 's safe you extend it now and when you come back , have it renewed here . There might be complications ! < p>
<p> I can extend it here in our embassy ? any idea how much its cost ? thanks for the reply < p>
passport extension will cost you 200 riyals . . good for 3 months ... i think .
in the Filex group , you 'll know all the details ! Even if you are not a member of Filex , you can browse it !
30 to 45 days
Try calling the Embassy and ask for details .
I heard it takes about 1 month for the PP Renewal ...
for a month ? Actually , before they say maximum 45 days , but lately -LRB- like what happened to my wife and her friends , almost two months !
angel - it 's two months for passport renewal .
mga kabayan , tanong ko lang . . kung magpaparenew ba ng passport dito eh magpapaschedule sa philippine embassy tulad sa pilipinas ? ano ang requirements na need ko iprepare for passport renewal ?
so you need to post in english , although almost all who replied are `` kabayans '' -LRB- it 's a rule in QL -RRB- . Check the link as given by TD ! Since you will get an e-Passport , just the old passport , original and photocopied -LRB- you 'll keep the original after the verification -RRB- , and the payment . Of course you need to fill-up the renewal form !
give cash ... they will much like that way .
gold always works and chocolate ; -RRB-

It would be better to be specific that whom you are gon na present a gift . because women at different ages have different tastes
I think chocolates and money are very common gift but . If we think about the jewelry and pendant , necklace or ring etc , May be best gift for women . I think jewelries are most beautiful things that women will definitely love . <imgÂ src=http:  images.doba.com products 3863 mod_images_image_czsetliezel.jpgÂ height=250Â width=250> I found it at <aÂ href=http:  ergode.com christmas gift-for-herÂ rel=dofollow> Christmas gift for her < a> section of ergode .

Hello friend , you can rent a car no problem ... But becarefull with radars and traffic camera s Welcome to Qatar and enjoy its beauty .
yes no problem . i used my international licence for 10 months with a rental . even had an accident and had no problem at traffic dept with that licence .
Yes no problem , did exactly that when we arrived , but make sure you convert to a Qatari Driving license as soon as your RP is processed
Thanks a lot

Well , i never tried getting so fat and too skinny in my entire life.maybe it 's an advantage that I do n't like to eat something sweet . I eat chocolates once for two months or nothing at all . I just do n't like it . I do walk sometimes whenever I get the chance . I eat not too small not too plenty . . but my weight is the same . I guess my physique is really like this . . But sometimes , i 'd still want to lose a few pounds but my friends are telling me no need to lose anything . . they tell me i 'm getting paranoid sometimes . . : -LRB-
You 've never had kids right ? lol . . wait till you get preggers , habibthy !
Fatimah - dont scare the poor thing ... : P
dean. , I 'm doing that the whole month of ramadan . . It 's great . . Hope i 'll get the chance again this coming eid , since I 'm very occupied during work days and my work is up to 8pm . . I 'm always tired after work . .
Yes fathimah , i never had kids , i 'm not married and I 'm still 20 , mybe u r right , but my mom has the same physique as me after having 3 kids , i hope I 'd be like her too someday . . now , i still have little baby fats , i want to get rid of this .
You might have a heart attack due to high amount of colesterol in blood . Scientifically not good .

I do n't know if you guys have read the article in the local english newspaper about some scientific findings that exercising is actually not the key to being skinny ... I think that 's bull , though . And anyway , scientists always scares me . Them and their `` findings '' . I do try to get exercise when I can , which is not a lot of times since i 'm soooo busy lately . If I ca n't do that , I go do Atkins . I loooove eating , and i get so guilty that I have to diet after . It 's like a yo-yo diet . Not good , I know , but what do I do when I do n't have time for exercise ?
I have found that Atkins in Qatar is really difficult ... I lost over 50kgs on it and kept it off for 3 years -LRB- including 2.5 years in Qatar -RRB- - then about 2 years ago , I just could n't contain myself with all the good food - hummous , arabic bread , naan , butter chicken ... etc. . . Techincally , I should n't have had a much of a problem - you can eat kebab with Rocket leaves and onions - or in salad - chicken does n't have to be your only option . Brunch at a Hotel on Sundays is brilliant - Berries , eggs and turkey beef bacon , sausages , meat - thats all allowed . What about making a smoothie of cream , berries and ice ? Omelettes with mushrooms , greem peppers , diced chicken and cheeze ... There are lots of choices ... Have you seen this ... http:  www.atkins.com Program low-carb-online-tools.aspx There is a tab that will take you to meal plans and recipes ... try it :--RRB- You have just inspired me to start again ...
Wow , 50 kgs ! I do n't think I inspire you ... I think it is the other way around ! Thanks for sharing . :-RRB- From what I know , I 'm not allowed to eat fruits . Berries are fruits , right ? I 'm still in induction phase , sorta . I 'm at it for almost 2 weeks now , and believe you me , I lost almost 3 kilos already ! It works , it works , it works people ! Ok , after the induction phase then I can start introducing carbs in my diet ... by now i 've no appetite for carbs , really . I 've lost it couple of days ago . I 'm just bored with the same old food that 's all . I guess my problem is i 'm too tired to prepare something new and something on my own . Lazy , lazy , lazy . Eating out is a pain , since if you eat steaks -LRB- which I loooove -RRB- you get carbs as side dish . I do n't want to be tempted ! Quickest way is the good ol' chicken . I should n't complain I know . I 'm switching to kebab . Thanks for the tips , i 'm going to try out your suggestions !
50 Kgs ! Thats like a whole adult female !
Its impossible to follow a diet right through your life ...
Its impossible for me to follow a diet right through the day JM ; -RRB-
Exercise is definitely the key . I used to work out for an hour and a half 5 days a week and was skinny as a rail . Used to eat & drink whatever I wanted and would n't gain a pound . Met my husband and changed jobs , suddenly the workout time disappears and 2 years later here I am 20kg heavier and struggling to lose it , despite trying every diet in the book . Exercise , Exercise , Exercise !
The main reason is the person is eating more than the body requires ...
but found it too depressing . I just did the carb curfew thingy and still do it for maintaining my weight , so welcome all low carb food suggestions . And yes it does make ordering food from restos real hard after 5pm = -LRB-
Never tried any diet , never will ... I `` live to Eat '' : - -RRB-
Ultimately calorie counting will be anyones best bet.Its actually quite easy once you get a hang of it . And ofcourse exercise.On that note right now the weather is just awesome for evening walks !
Looks like I am doomed to be chubby then . If loosing weight means eating less and exercising I am sc *** ed .
He was slim because he was sick .
LP that 's what happens when you watch too many episodes of Friends
I was am on Atkins quite frequently and lost weight also . But I found some problems like getting hyper on staff customers , not been able to talk much etc etc. . So I dont observe atkins regularly . May be two weeks on atkins and then break for some days week and then again on atkins . Yes atkins certainly helped me in loosing weight . Foods you can include -LRB- apart from chicken -RRB- is eggs -LRB- all type -RRB- , zero cola , bottle gourd , egg plant , okra , cheese , fish , tuna , salads . One thing more is >> > lime juice once in day -LRB- especially in morning before food -RRB- . This is not recommended in Atkins coz of bit high in carb but it help in making your food balance to more alkaline compared to acidic food .
Good for me . I do n't even know what you 're talking about , TB .
Watch too many episodes of Friends and you become sick .
Thanks for the info waliams !
I do n't watch ` episodes ' , TB . Only full length movies .
Accepted , TB .
eh ? When ever i am in love , i feel like eating more and more to make LOVE ... : -LRB-
if it 's true then i think I 've never been in love. : P
gosh rizku - whatever
lol TB ... on a more serious note ... no diet will work without exercise . at the end of the day you need to move those muscles and do some exercise ... you can either walk or jog or anything u r comfy doing but u have to get a move on . alongwith exercise a diet thats fat free and sugar free helps a lot ... .
oh geez , you need to exercise !?! : P
Another alternative would be to use your brain excessively . It will burn calories like hell . -LRB- Proven in many experiments -RRB- .
Did n't Atkins die grossly overweight ?
I tried it and I lost weight at first but then just plateaued and did n't lose anymore and the moment you go off it you gain the weight back right away .
Make love , do n't eat . Simple as that .
LP eating is there ... in the foreplay ... how can one abstain ?!!
LP , is ur suggestion proven & tested?LOL . . Ohh , I love eating chicken all the time , so I 'd stick to chicken.haha just watch what u eat . . check the calories all the time , eat healthy foods , & exercise of course , Following LP 's tip is up to u : -RRB-
Trust me , jack . When you 're in love you lose appetite .
Camels ... they are lightweights compared to me ; -RRB-
Victoria Secret and Ann Summers would do nice business here . . ----------------- `` HE WHO DARES WINS '' Derek Edward Trotter
Finally someone with good subject to discus , thank you fembot I tried to invest three times in Qatar , the regulation here are too complicated if I want to put it in a sentence then it is as following : -LRB- Contacts and relationship is key for success in Qatar -RRB- I dont know when those people who are responsible for setting up the process and procedures will realize that attracting investments to Qatar is not just by dropping the taxes 10 % , no there are many other elements that should be considered
Hasan , Qtr , taxes are not just dropped to 10 % , but infact new taxes are introduced such as with holding taxes , guess in longer run , eventually goverment may collect more taxes by introduction of new taxes . ALLAH HU AKBAR - GOD IS GREAT
this is not true , u have no idea how much it is difficult to start a new business in any other country ...
Never ever think of starting a business in Qatar . I know I sound stupid . But believe me . The rules are one hell of sucking rules . If you go to the government office one day they will say one thing and second day they will say they dont want what they said on 1st day . I have been trying to setup an organization here for the past 4 months . No luck at all . And believe me , they want only want MNC to come to Doha . Im quiting the idea of setting up business here and go somewhere else . Freaking government officials and they F *** ing rules .
shaheka has a point , either you have a strong wealthy well known sponsor or just find a MNC to support you . Yalla !
It is true that the rules are not clearly set out even we Qataris had trouble sometimes with them but if you have a Qatari partner sponsor with good experience you can have your business up and running in a few months . . depending of course on the type of business and availability of the premises , manpower , resources etc. . .
i dont think businessmen or ladies chat in here . .
king_qatar , excuse moi ?
really i never met businessmen online what u do pittstop
Why not king-qatar ? We own our time more than govt employees !
king_qatar , what difference would it make ? LOL -- I 'm an employee , a business owner , and a student .
No qatarisun I 'm 100 % Qataria . .
I believe that Qatar now in its best state for starting a business than it has ever been . I also believe Qatar has advantages over many other countires in terms of business especially in terms of tax and charges . The only thing holding me from starting a business is the good idea which I am seriously searching for .
well as we all know tht the prices here are way to expensive thn in US , that is the onl reason i was looking out for a dealer in Washington , i was in touch with a dealer in NY who is also accosiated with Amazon , who had given me a good price for the camera and the lense , but the only problem is tht i am bit nervous in having it shipped out via courier , but then when a friend of mine told me tht he is flying to washington and if i cud find a reputed dealer in there he could pick it up for me and for sure will be cheaper as i can save on the customs duty and the courier charges . That is the only reason .
s_isale - I thought the request was quite straight forward . saurabh - See my reply above . Blood - helpful as ever .
thank you , Blood , can you please give me little more detail , as i mentioned above : `` Blood , can you let me know where excatly are you talking abt , and yes getting a discount is always good . ''
baldrick , it was really helpfull , i do have tow address now and will pass it over to a friend of mine , but before i do tht i 'll call up their office in US and get all the details . Thank you for the help .
I thought this was some kind of a joke , the south pole is very far away for us to buy a camera delivering it to Qatar would really cost more than the camera itself , come on guys you made me feel guilty . My bad . : -LRB-
No issues , blood , atleast you ere kind enough to reply back to the post .
Blood , the problem is that for high end cameras , it 's still cheaper including delivery to get them shipped from USA , than it is to buy them here . I bought my 5D on holiday in KL and a friends 7D in HK - they both worked out about 1 2 price compared to Doha
About the south pole dealer if interested , I even might be able to get a special discount too .
Yes , at Nazih beauty supply , on Salwa road . But , you can make your own too ! Just take a sock , cut off the toe part , and roll it into a ring ... viols , a doughnut !

Its a new cafe that is gon na open near the pizza hut ... near the airport.There used to be a cafeteria called samco , they closed it down . Doha rocks have taken over it .
Doha Rocks Cafe is opening soon at Airport Signal . Doha Rocks Cafe will be one of the most happening joints in town . It is going to be one of its kind in Doha as with all of their international cafe 's across the world . You can enjoy free WiFi and make your meetings and leisure worth it . Doha Rocks Cafe ambience is uncomparable . Let us wait for the opening . They have an online presence at www.doharockscafe.co ...
Doha Rocks are things found in the Doha Desert ; oS
It 's the place Bob Dylan refers to when he sings : '' Everybody must get stoned . ''
Is it kind of Hard Rock Cafe or something ? But I 've noticed they were saying its good for kids . Strange name for a place like that , is n't it ? anyways , any clue when its gon na get opened ?
hey Clement , could bea a place equally enjoyable for kids too . Just wait a see dude .
DOHA ROCKS ?? hahahaha funny name for a cafe.Im sure its gon na be as boring as a sleeping pill . . zzzzzzz !!!!
oops !! i already fell asleep !
If you goto the corniche , you will find these little pebbles close to the sea . I think Doha Rocks is a subtle reference to them .
whatta wierd name for a cafe `` doha rocks '' we dont 've such cafes in the madagascar . ahh i get it . . u got ta say the order like `` one kappuccino on the rocks '' haha . . do i get an iPod now .

Well i have been to Al emadi Hospital they have quite a good dermatologist section . New exacly what to prescribe and advise me . Price wise i havent got a clue
try to look in the directory for DR.Ghazi Clinic ... he charge 200qr for consultation but i dont know how much for the treatment that your asking ... try to call so that you will have an idea of the price ... goodluck : -RRB-
I heard that Royal Medical center has a good dermatologist named : Rasha el Assi , give it a try ! call them on : 44659492
you surely need a visa and since your wife is working in Hamad she can bring the baby on her sponsership .
I think you can bring the baby within 40days why she did not deliver in Qatar she is a nurse . when come attached both salary certificate and a letter from our sponsor NOC that u can sponsor the baby.Please wait for more response .
Well It is not possible to get your baby without a valid visa as you know now there are provisions for a passport to be made for a new born .
yes dear , you can bring your baby without a visa upto 90 days old but with a valid passport.subjected your wife 's visa is still active . . after entering to qatar you have to process residense visa within one month . you need , birth certificate -LRB- attested by minstry of foreign affairs and qatar consulate in your country -RRB- , sponsors -LRB- your wife -RRB- visa and id copies , bank statements -LRB- 3mnths -RRB- , residential contract copy , attested degree certificates -LRB- rarely asks -RRB- and of course photographs of baby . since your wife is not under your sponsorship , before proceeding check with her sponsor for additional requirements.good luck .
Hi Shan Yes you can bring your child , visa will get on arrival , i think now upto 60 days no visa need , u have to bring attested birth cirtificate together . after arrival within 7 days u have to report authority .
You dont have anything to do , do you ?
sister , TRY the malls like CITY CENTRE , VILAGGIO . orELSE u just have to keep calling all the pharmacies . here is the link with all the numbers u need to call . http:  www.qtel.qa ImpSearch.do?catList=7&subList=4 GoodLuck !!
It 's one of the most common medicines around but seem to have a shortage throughout Qatar at the moment . It happens to quite a lot of medicines here . I would persevere and keep trying smaller Pharmacies . Do n't bother phoning , actually go in as half the time the staff wo n't understand and its easier just to say no .
My wife is on these supplements for low stomach acid , she has not joined me out here yet , but we were going to get them sent from the UK as we were n't sure if they are available here . It might be worth trying the internet if you have a PO box that they can be sent to , when my wife ran out of them she found it helpful to eat an orange with a meal as this does increase the stomachs ability to break down the fats . Do n't use a lemon as these turn alkiline in the stomach and make the problem worse . Good luck
bad idea ...
he can
its ur life 's first and last mistake
he can marry a british or american girl how much more an asian girl . .
Better ask your Qatari BF about this ... he knows best ...
middle east asia , southeast asia , or fareast asia . . of corz yes he can . . y not . . money can buy all things anway . .
Do n't marry an Arab if you want to be happy .
yes , 4 times different nationalities !
they brough the world cup in here why ca n't he marry an Asian Girl . . :-RRB-
As a first wife it can be very difficult to get permission . For second third fourth it is easier .
so it is better to remain as a MISTRESS , as others think it is very bad to be a second wife .
at least u have the freedom , and the wife has the rights ; -RRB-
another name ... `` seppukku '' . .
Hara-kiri Meaning and Definition -LRB- n. -RRB- Suicide , by slashing the abdomen , formerly practiced in Japan , and commanded by the government in the cases of disgraced officials ; disembowelment ; -- also written , but incorrectly , hari-kari . http:  thinkexist.com dictionary meaning hara-kiri
means `` ceremonial siucide ''
seppuku - Ritual suicide by disembowelment formerly practiced by Japanese samurai . Also called hara-kiri . ???
Is n't every marriage a ceremonial suicide ??
marry me i have oil wells too
Yes they can . The man has to get permission from the government . this can be time consuming sometimes . The best option is to ask at Fanar or similar .
there is a temporary marriage here , it seems ... but why waste life on temporary basis ... we become older everyday , depreciating everyday bad idea ...
the funny thing is that if the word `` temporary '' included in marriage , the contract will be canceled . temporary + contract of marriage = `` not marriage , but ... :P ''
bad idea ... really wait , take ur time ... u will meet someone who will be willing to spend the rest of his life with you and love u sincerely .
yes ... he can ... the procedure is known as `` Harakiri ' and it works both ways !!
Ive known they have alot of expats like filipino indians paramedics in HMC and plus they provide good accommodation for their staff single or family status .
Depending on the grade and size of family they provide , definitely a decent furnished accomodation .
they provide decent accomodation u can take money and can stay outside
but there is a private company that does PHES run . I ca n't remember the name of it but it may be on their website or call them a week before school starts to ask for the contact details .

how much r u selling ur sewing machine for ?

2 working days if you submit all proper documents . She can come back under your sponsorship and work if she has got an NOC from her previous company .
All depends on your company PRO . If your PRO is smart enough hw can get in two days ...

so if she doesnt have NOC ; she can not work ??
yes she must require an NOC from previous employer if she want to work , but anyhow on a family visit visa no body is allow to work .
Painting is very easy and a fun job to do . You can buy the paint at any Jotun shop , where they will mix it by computer to any shade you want . Then get some rollers and do it yourself . You will save a lot of money and you will feel so much better after you have completed the job . Really rewarding . I love painting my house and have done everything myself . Aisha-Taweela
is what we spent for each room . They are more than ripping you off . We went to Jotun -LRB- there is one in the same place as Party Kingdom near Jaidah Flyover -RRB- and bought the paint there and contracted with one of their workers . He would come over at night after his regular job was done . this was somewhat inconvenient , but he was good and cheap !
I ended up finding someone to paint the three rooms for 1,000 QR . It 's more than 200 room , but he paints for a number of people in the compound and brings his own supplies . I need to scurry on over to pick up the paint tomorrow ! cheers , Expat Sueo
Do n't let me fool you ... I 'm blessed by plenty of bad luck as well . I have more `` strange bad luck stories '' than you could possibly imagine !
Dear , Than you should close to GOD always pray for your luck . Its doest not matter . I do n't know anything about luck . I 've never banked on it , and I 'm afraid of people who do . Luck to me is something else ; hard work and realizing what is opportunity and what is n't   When the good luck comes - ready to receive it . Always count yourself in lucky persons . . Thanks
The person who came did it for 1,000 QR and did a fantastic job . The guy who wanted to do it for 4,500 must have been smoking something !
ALWYAS COUNT UR LIFE WITH SMILES ...
do u have phone number for guy who done ur painting , pm me thanks
the 200 and the 1500 sound logical . it really depends on the extent of work . it could be simple painting and applying one or two layers of normal paint . It could be also a complicated task which involve scraping , priming then doing several layers of paint . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = http:  www.qatarliving.com node 58409

`` Driving a vehicle loaded in such a way that it cause damage to people and surroundings '' - this usually means speeding and it is caught by the radar at traffic lights if you cross the speed limit for that road . You can go to Traffic Dept at Old Airport or Madinat Khalifa and request to see a video of the violation . Ur dad can tell if its his car and move accordingly . The place zones can often be misleading due to error in data entry . But timing will be accurate , only our minds play tricks on timings . Worth checking out the video than speculating .
its happened with me once and they mention that driving a car which is above 50 meters or the level allowd in website and when i checked in arabic then i find out its a seat belt panelty ... when they enter in there system at traffic dept they enter in arabic and then system is translating in silly enligh option which is enterd already from there side at traffic dept. .

QR500 . But then these LC 's are parked in the middle of the road waiting for groceries without any tickets issued
+3 points
a ticket on line and I made a enquiry also online and explianed that I was at work at the time of the incident . The violation disappeared . Make sure you are inputting the proper type of license plate . Cars are private vehicles and trucks are private transportation , do n't pay someone else 's fine by accident , unless it 's mine . I do n't think we need to do anything in the name of God , he 's a big boy and can take of himself .

From what i know , Nurserys are available all year round . If its a kindergarden , some close in summer . However some provide summer programs for the kids who stay in Doha , but you would need to register before the available positions fill up .
If I get a job I need to have my children in nurserys . Here in Norway both my children will be in a nurserys , we cant afford to live on one salery
you wont have any problem getting a nursery here for your child .
Of course if you want to work , that 's fine ... But as a European your husband should have gotten a salary package that can support a family . If he did n't , you got taken advantage of .
USAexpat ... wrong completely ... thats not how it works .
can send them in the midle of the year , most of the nurseries provide summer program , and most of them start around 6 am or 6 :30 until 2 , 3or 4 pm , the good ones are expensive around 1600 ,1800 QR .
I think I have to wait until we know if we are moving or not before I put the kids name on any lists . Im not sure if my husbands company are paying for nursery , I know they are paying for school , but not sure about nursery .
I already checked out the classifieds . But is it always better to investigate through friends and people who already experienced all these : -RRB-

hi , you could apply in labour dept for the visa . the infant with less than 3 months old need not require visa to enter into qatar .
Either one of you can sponsor , no issues , check with your PRO about the formalities .
It 'll be easiest if the man sponsors the child - less questions and raised eyebrows . Birth certificate from Hamad NHA , passport from Embassy , then get the RP .
careefaur , street no-18 , central bazar , north beijing , china .
technically you ca n't work under your father 's sponsorship But you can transfer your sponsorship to whichever employer even if your employer does not have a visa of your specific nationality , its easier that way But if and when you do a transfer , you have to be careful because specific nationalities such as Jordanian for instance can be denied a transfer in which case you may end up in trouble ...
concentrate on your studies and when you finish , it 's time to find work suitable for you .

spot on happy ... talk shows are just as informative as the `` standard '' news channels . thanks for link !
TVE has all what I need , but I do n't understand their Spanish sometimes ! DW , not bad , and even in English ; Al Jazeera is improving tremendously ... but let 's be honest , all are more or less copying the style of BBC !!
I like iReport of CNN . Salam
The Daily Show . My entire knowledge comes from John Stewart and his team .
nah , , , i like BBC ...
I have a lot of respect for Christiane Amanpour of the CNN and Zeinab Badawi of the BBC 's Hardtalk . Salam
One more vote for the Daily Show and Colbert ...
While I do like to watch Stewart and Colbert 's , for their straight critique but they do get on my nerves at times , specially Colberts . Salam
FTV and MTV are the best . . :-RRB- Salam
soooo true !!! love the FW09 collections , specially Ralph Lauren 's ... ...
Maybe you 're right , but I really think he 's sometimes overdoing it . Shoe , you 're so serious about this business . . :-RRB- Salam
Did you see his recent interview with Katy Couric -LRB- who anchors the CBS Nightly News show -RRB- . It 's kind of scary when you think that the Daily Show -LRB- which I love and do watch daily -- at least on the 4 days a week it runs -RRB- could be the primary source of news for certain demographics in the US . I like the PBS News Hours . It 's the only US show that actually covers the days news in depth . BBC world does a good job . Fox news is appalling in its slant , especially as it pretends to be objective news -LRB- at least MSNBC , which slants in the other direction doesnt pretend to be news instead of opinion -RRB- . CNN is OK . Outside the US and UK , Al Jazeera International really does do a good job of presenting a more third World centered view . As for Qatar news : fugetaboutit , best source seems to be QL
Any local channel would have extensive coverage of their leaders ' international visits . Egyptian Nile TV covers Mubarak 's visits of where he went , who he met with , what he had for lunch , when he played squash , who he shook hands with , and how many steps he climbed up to get back to the plane , en route to Egypt . . :-RRB- This is so boring ! Salam
I do n't think there is objectivity in any news channel let alone truthful information ... Even if a certain tv news channel is truthful , it will focus on issues that are of interest to her which does not make things objective . However , I would vote for the Arabic Al-Jazeera .
check many other channels to confirm NEWS -LRB- LIKE investigating History -RRB- or DISCOVERY Channel ... Personally I feel Al Jazeera show directly from Horse Mouth and do n't involve personal commentaries on the subject ... From India most reliable is NDTV , TIMES NOW and HEADLINES TODAY ... International NEWS ... BBC , CNN ... Pakistan GEO
i like al jazeera in arabic , like FOX is a propaganda machine for U.S right wing AL-Jazeera is a propanganda machine , i never heard about domestic issues of arab world properly in al jazeera . so i love the arabic version escipially the advertisments which is a big relief .
I was mainly referring to regional channels , do n't know about the rest of the world 's local news channels . But imagine having to put up with 20 minutes of listing the names of every single member at the leader 's reception ! Oh , and of course all internal affairs are good and satisfactory . . :-RRB- Salam
HBO and Star Movies
Happy , I wonder if the leaders of those countries are that stupid or do they think their people , is ?
Real news is so depressing . I stopped watching it a long time ago .
<b> <i> ... ... . Dawn News and Al Jazeera English ... ...
The Daily Show & the Colbert Report . Without a doubt the most objective news shows in the world . :-RRB-
Loved last weeks Colbert Report when Obama popped up for the haircut section .
Loved last nights Daily Show when he compared what was showing on Fox , to what was showing on MSNBC to what was showing on CNN . I was nearly wetting myself .
Express News or Geo Pakistan ... . Or our Pakistani Police , , Cause some times they already knows before the happening of any Incident.LOL
Colbert broadcast from my old stomping grounds last week Camp Victory iraq ... You ca n't teach experience ...

While I do have high regard for Al-Jazeera English , simply because the Arab world is in dire need for its voice to be heard in main languages , and to balance out international media coverage , but I do n't think it 's the most objective , no . Would you agree to that ? Salam
I would 've wished for the Al-Jazeera to be the most honest , would 've been absolutely proud , but I 'm afraid it 's not , although it has all the means to become one . Maybe their policy will change ? Salam
I think they will grow and mature . But if they want to be viewed as anything but an anti-Western mouthpiece they will need watch their editorial bias . Fox does n't care about such things and is happy to be seen as the Right Wing network it is . I would hope that A-J does n't follow that same path . They are positioned -LRB- and funded -RRB- to make great contributions international media . Unfortunately , as long as they allow someone 's politics to color their reporting , they will be marginalized . I think you get the best sense of what 's going on by watching a lot of different news . I watch BBC , CNN , AJE , and MSNBC . I even occasionally Fox so I can see what the enemy is up to :--RRB- <p> &#160; < p> <p> &#160; < p> <p> &#160; < p> <p> <strong> I refuse to drink the kool-aid ! < strong> -- <em> PM < em> < p>
You said it all indeed ! specially the last paragraph , I keep thinking what is a 100 % objective coverage ? There will always be two sides of any story . I think the BBC is the most objective , but I have to watch CNN and one Arab channel -LRB- Al-Jazeera or Al-Arabia -RRB- to make sure Im not mislead . Salam
But zipping through news channels or their online websites is a very time-consuming procedure , all to dig for where the truth is . I consider this overload by my today 's standards , no time ! Oh , and I 'm into news websites polls too . . :-RRB- -RRB- Salam
Fahmy Alhoweidy is right , and if this article proves anything , it proves that we 're entitled , in Egypt , to criticizing the President 's policy without fear . Many people around the world are unaware of this fact . Not that he is going to act on it ! Salam
Al jazeera Eng & Daily Show -LRB- John Stewart -RRB- Imran
I 'm sure I 'm very unaware of many things in life . This is why objectivity is at risk , always . Ash , I 'm sure there is worse , you just do n't know about it ... :-RRB- Salam
Anyone watches David Letterman and Jay Leno ? And how come no one here shared who their favorite news reporter anchor was ? Salam
HH , Leno has recently been replaced by Connan O Brien . Although these talk shows host have a good sense of humor , not all the jokes are tailor made for an international crowd . Sometimes they are just too local and little or no interest to international audiences ... just some times :-RRB- As for reporters news anchors , CNN has a few very good ones ; Christiane Amanpour is an example among others . The news anchor in Dubai One , sound like bad acting !
I would also go for Daily Show . By the way , can anybody tell me at what time and day its on , here in Doha ? thanks
It 's on at 9:00 pm on Showtime .
Thanks Gipsy ! I used to watch it on CNN , sat at 17:30 but they stopped it since a couple of weeks ago !
It seems that I should start counting votes , like QL 's Dracula masters on most of his threads . Daily Show and Colbert Report are way ahead so far ! Salam
Qatar TV is the only TV station which does n't spill lies . And most importantly , we are informed about the numbers of letters -LRB- not the content , though -RRB- the Emir and his son have sent and received during the day .
Qatar TV has a very good talk show , titled Aldar , which tackles and highlights very important local issues , and puts it out to the public . I 'm sure there are other shows I 'm not aware of . Also Good Morning Qatar is a good Radio broadcast , not only seeking entertaining but reform . salam

Happy , Hopefully the situation improves soon in these authoritarian regimes ! At least in countries like Egypt , Tunisia and others , the people are aware and active but some like the one we are at the moment , total submission and passivity rules !
it is better to disable to sound sometimes otherwise , like bleu said , you may hear inappropriate terms . I am referring here to what the courteous G. W. Bush once said about Syria speaking to T. Blaire over lunch !
I bet , that 's what 's happening , bleu .
And let me add to your point about objectivity that in today 's world , news coverage has to be 3D , the old myth of 2 sides of the story is n't enough any more , there is always a 3rd party involved , then 3D it shall be . . :-RRB- Salam

I work for the government and all my Qatari counterparts make the same as I do ... in all the departments based on grade and we are more than 1000 employees . Private companies may differ but anything on a grade all the salaries are the same or within a specific range . Only difference is the social allowance , which I dont get but as they are Qataris they dont get housing ... With my housing allowance I actually make more than my Qatari counterparts . As for their inflated titles , thats a different story .

You can also try City Center . They have many sports shops next to each other . The good thing about english fans , is that they keep hoping that their team will actually win something ...

Christmas and New year are n't really celebrated over here . You will find some decorations and artificial trees but they go very quickly ! As for New Year , going to bed at the normal time is the best you can do ! We stayed up for one but were so far ahead , time wise , to ring up family back home that we gave up.Had a glass of bubbly and that was that ! I guess , if you have lots of like minded friends , you can get together for a ` do ' .
They sell it in Carrefour -LRB- City Centre -RRB- along with a load of other Christmas Tat . Not sure if it 's the type you want though , you 'd have to go down and check .
have you tried the party shop next to hallmark card shop in villagio , bet they will have it
Yeah , party shop got the powdery snow spray . I bought some yesterday : -RRB-
OOOh tank you guys - I had tried that party shop about a week ago but at the time they did n't have any in - they said they may get some - but you know , was n't sure whether to believe them or not lol !!! So that 's me off to Villagio this week - SNOW IN A CAN ! :--RRB- xxx
pure business !
techno blue has them .
carrefour , virgin
Carrefour and Virgin have the best selection , but I beleive the cheapest ones are in Radioshack
I have bought one from City Center . Try Jumbo also for the cable .
Dude before you purchase HDMI cable double check the following : 1 - what HDMI ver your Plasma and Video Device is supporting ? you will notice that there are V1 .03 and lower versions . 2 - What Resolution your plasma and video device has ? Not all HDMI can transmi 1080p resolution . 3 - If you have special features like Vieara link -LRB- Control -RRB- etc , make sure that you purchase the cable from the same manifacturer for compatibility issue . Where to buy : 1 - High end places : Techno Q - Salwa Road - 4689494 - Expensive but the best quality . 2 - Virgin Mega storessss 3 - Carefour
Thanks for all , but where is the location of Virgin
From citycentre .
I think that you might have left it a bit late . . As you will travelling through Saudi Arabia to UAE then you require a Transit visa . Normally KSA embassy here in Qatar stop issuing Transit visa about two weeks before the Eid . . The rest of the trip is not worth mentioning if youhave not this first step . .
It is too late now Tess ; plan in advance minimum 2 weeks for next Eid ; give me a PM and I will provide the detail including maps , distance in KMs , etc. .
its too late now you should ask for visa atleast before 15 days
I do n't have problem to love Qatar but you must admit that its not fully country still needs lots of things to be more intresting and more usful not for work only non Qatari people in Qatar come for work so they work the hole day and in the weekends feel boaring that nothing to do except shoping in malls I think this is not good life cz also qatari when they wan na have good time traviling to Dubai ...
Rasha , ask yourself , `` why does Dubai have all the things Qatar does n't ? '' You should find the simple answer that Dubai 's Oil and Gas reserves are dwindling and they are boosting tourism as a revenue earner . Qatar is sat on a huge gas bubble and does n't <i> need < i> tourism as much .

Rasha - because I do n't like Dubai , and would be disappointed if Qatar -LRB- Doha -RRB- turned out the same .
ya I know its growing now but the final I think will be after 50 or 100 nyears to be central country
what do u mean by hopefully not Tallg ????
Agree with TallG & Darude '' <i> AN END DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE MEANS < i> ''
Qatar is much better than Dubai . Too commercial for me . Qatar is unique and I think , will stay that way .
+1 Tallg , you beat me to it . Rasha , How many souqs does Dubai have ? I 've only ever seen one . Malls , gee whiz , I can shop anywhere . Cafes , ? We have plenty . What does Dubai have that I 'd like to see here ? 1 . Wild Wadi 2 . A Go Kart track 3 .
I need logic answers please not dream answers
what good do you see in Dubai . Qatar is better than Dubai i would say . <imgÂ src=http:  www.qatarliving.com files images Da.gif>
and if any body can guess what qatar will look like after 25 years which country will be similar or will be unqiue but I dont think that qatar will has own style qatar will take part from each country to bulid her civilization as Islamic Museaum nothing related to qatar its Iranian and syrian and egyptian arts nothing realted to qatar cz on that time qatar was tribe that set and if all the expat get out of qatar will return to be tribe again cz expat who make qatar ANY ONE CAN ANSWER
Qatar today was like Dubai five years ago !
To your question , `` Hopefully , never '' ... Hope Qatar retains its individuality and doesnt become too much like Dubai . . abe
as it needs to open up a lot to catch up to dubai buy maybe in 2015 hopefully . well they are trying to copy dubai by building big buildings and also big roads and stuff but still they need to open up a little bit .
So where do u go for fun Alexa ? I alternate between irish and intercon but am running out of ideas ! Any suggestions ?

Hmm , ok fine . I was just wondering ... wont QTEL have the logs or something ? No other way of finding the IMEI no . without finding the box ?

now i 'm getting curious of what 's inside that mobile ... lol , .
dont get curious ... it is a 2009 thread , we are now in 2013
Ok , my friend does have some important files in the mobile . Are they at risk too ?
Left dona know what da right hand is doin . AND very rude with phonecalls and thelike
I have no complains at all , we are moving from Dubai , went in June for interviews and they were lovely and so far very helpful with everything else through emails
Does anyone know what sort of teachers this school will have ? We are so fedup with `` foreign legion '' teachers at these sort of schools
Go to http:  www.sherborne.org page Sherborne_Qatar Sherborne_Qatar_Staff_Biographies and you can check out their biographies
BTW Luchy , do you have some connection with Sherborne School ?
Piggly-riggly you mention that you had so many issues but you have n't named one so far . What issues did you have ? My personal experience has been that the staff were very helpful from day one and I have n't had any issues .
I have recently enrolled my son in sherborne and I think they are excellent . We have no complaints .
Well , it is a pleasant change to hear this from a parent whose child is at a school in Qatar .
not yet ...
Actually Sherborne is the second highest fee chanrging school after the Ameriacn School of Doha . . ASD ? ----------------- `` HE WHO DARES WINS '' Derek Edward Trotter
What 's unusual is that you get what you pay for . With many of the schools in Doha you can pay a fortune and still not receive a good education .
Even if sherborne double thier fees tomorrow , I would still send my son there . Its worth every penny .
qatbrit has used the right ` their ' and ` there ' in her message - have I missed something ??! Having just visited a number of schools in Qatar I was very much impressed with the importance placed on learning the 3 ` Rs in primary school . I know for a fact in the UK that in British schools the spelling is appalling - teachers do n't want to correct mistakes just in case the feelings of the child are knocked !! I personally found Doha College to be way above its station - unable to respond to emails requesting a visit and then when they did , they could not arrange a whole school visit requiring us to visit twice if we wanted to see both primary and secondary . I will not bother - I can not imaging how they would deal with a case of bullying if a whole school visit was beyond their capabilities . Maybe they do n't need more pupils coming to their school - I do know that resting on your laurels is never good . I expect the teachers at Doha College are good but if their administration is as weak as it appears parents will take their children elsewhere for fear of bad management . First impressions still count !
How much can the extras go up to a Sherborne ? Are those usually covered by the company ? And how have you folks found the school so far ? It seems to offer a lot of extra-curricular activities and has a good backing . Any other schools that you 'd recommend - my sons are 6 and 3.5 Cheers
Qabrit - I am assumng your company is paying here ;-RRB- Do they also cover the extras ? Cheers
Hi , I am a mother of a 6 yr old boy and is looking for a good school in Doha . I recently got a call for an opening for my son at Sherborne.I am confused as I have also heard about ASD that its also a very good school . As yr child is in Sherborne , Can you please let me know how the school is ? should I opt for Sherborne or wait for ASD to reply ? How are the teachers at Sherborne ? Hows the atmosphere ? are u satisfied ? Please let me know your feedback . I will really appreciate . Thanks ,
Sherborne Qatar is a school run as a business making profit . It is owned by one of the Al-Thani mob . There are lots of problems with this school . Many higly experienced teachers left after just one year and a another teacher recently quit . They have tried to set up a British Prep school in the desert - it just does not work . Few of the remaining staff have much international experience - most of them are snobby types from the UK with little overseas experience or knowledge about Arab customs . The organisational of the school is poor - reactionary management . Contact with the Head is limited . They have a Board of Govenors made up of pompous types . There are very few decent schooling options in Qatar and it looks like that Sherborne Qatar will never live up to the advertised promises . Avoid for now - far too many problems related to cultural adjustment .
Susan Chang , you make lots of claims but what is your proof ? Do you have or did you have a child at Sherborne ? My personal experience as a qualified teacher , who has supported many of the students at Sherborne , has been very positive . In fact I was sceptical about how well a new school could do in its first year . I have been quite surprised by what they have achieved so far both academically and in terms of students ' holistic development .
My proof is that I am friends with several teachers and families currently at the school or who have recently left . I stand by all I have said . There are really no decent schools in Qatar . It is absurd to think you can set up a British Prep School in the middle of the desert . The whole operation is a business shum run for money - a profit making venture trading upon a famous name . There are a bunch of pompous UK Govenors who have a lot of egg on their faces at the moment and are doing everything to avoid swallowing their pride . The only reason the majority of the teaching staff did not leave last year is because they were granted a 10 % lump cash sum payment to basically remain hush and avoid speaking out . What more would you like to know ? The only reason the school survived its first year was because of the teachers , not for any other reason . The same can be said for many if not all the schools in Qatar .
Quite frankly any school in Doha indirectly helps to sustain a corrupt system of government -LRB- a Family Dynasty -RRB- , that directly depends on the mass importation of hundreds of thousands of poor people from countries like Nepal , Bangladesh , India and Pakistan . These people are totally exploited and treated like modern day slaves . They survive on about 800 QR a month . No school in Doha can deny that they indirectly helps to sustain such a system . That is why I say that there are no good schools in Doha . Their moral foundations are corrupt . It has nothing to do about IVY league universities . Decent people should get out of this sham of a country . Sherborne UK has jumped into bed with a corrupt family and have had their fingers badly burnt . They now lack integrity and all that they propose they stand for back in the UK .
we moved from Dubai too and my kids are going to the same school , they seem to be alright however I am not quite sure about how strong are they in their acadamics
but using your own logic , you and your husbands jobs -LRB- or you emotionally supporting your husbands decision to work here in Qatar -RRB- are sustaining your employers , who in turn , are `` sustaining corrupt family monarchies who deny their citizens and visitors basic human rights and freedoms '' . Therefore the only logical option open to you is to leave . This is the first time I have suggested that anyone should leave Qatar - but unfortunately this is the corner you have painted yourself into .
first of all , the only reason Sherborne established a branch here because it 's part of the supreme council of education `` Education for a New Era '' Outstanding Schools Initiative . which is a RAND initiative -LRB- if you know what i mean -RRB- . So far , Qatari students accounts for less than 10 % of the total number of students . Most Qataris enroll their offspring in government schools . Overall , Private schools target expatriates who works here , and the fact is most of the expatriates who enrolls their offspring in private schools receives education allowance from their employers And let 's be honest , most of you wishes deep inside that your countries are a monarchy . The immigrants are sucking your resources dry , Degrading your national health & education systems . Despite all that your salaries are deducted as taxes to pay for the welfare of those immigrants . And yet , you got to pay for utilities ;-RRB-
Hello Genesis , Would you adopt a Affirmative or Negative viewpoint ? Schools like Sherborne have put into place racially discriminatory quota systems of not enrolling more than 20 % Qatari students , not 10 % as you did suggest . Of course Sherborne can get away with this in Qatar and would never be able to implement such an unfair policy back in the UK . Your paragraph about immigrants sucking the national health and education system dry is sheer nonsense . A simple and poorly worded opinion without evidence or substance . As for Adley , I am pleased that you have managed to reach some sort of conclusion . I really think that all highly trained Western Expats including yourelf should leave Qatari , not just me ! More debate is required .
School demographics is an issue in the UK just as much as it is in Qatar . It is difficult to maintain a high standard of learning if a large proportion of students in a classroom are not fluent in the language of instruction . The way most private schools in the UK address this issue is by setting a limit on the percentage of non-native speakers of English . Otherwise , the majority of the population in these schools would consist of Indian and Chinese students . This is because of the sheer volume of applicants from these two countries . In Qatar those schools , with a small population of first language English speakers , such as QIS and Al-Jazeera Academy , tend not achieve the same standards as those with more first language speakers . This does not mean that those students who are not fluent in English are less able but it does show that not being fluent in a language can be a barrier to learning .
Academic integrity of school 2 Effectiveness of administration 2 Academic and disciplinary support provided 2 Director 's involvement in academics 2 Fair and equitable treatment by board and director 2 School has adequate educational materials on hand 5 Attitude of local community towards foreigners 5 Cost of living in relation to salary -LRB- 10 = most favorable -RRB- 3 Satisfaction with housing 2 Community offers a variety of activities 6 Availability and quality of local health care 6 Assistance with visas , shipping and air travel 1 Extra curricular load is reasonable 5 Comments : Sheikha Aisha owns and operates this substandard ` international ' school . Do n't be fooled , it 's an international school in theory but an Islamic school for delinquent Al Thani children . All the students that have been expelled or refuse entrance to another school know they can attend Doha Academy . Mr. Farouk , head of the secondary school , is abully who rules through intimidation . He has his minions who follow him around like hungry puppies hoping that he 'll throw a bone their way . Anyone who dares to stand up to him is a target of his . He derives immense pleasure in humiliating and demoralizing students . How this man was ever appointed in a school boggles the mind . Sheikha Aisha , the owner operator , is notorious for not honoring contracts . Foolishly I thought that once a contract was agreed to and signed , it would be honored . Not so . She has blatantly broken contracts because she decided she did n't want to pay airfare . The Sheikha is a dishonest , disreputable woman who is only after two things , money and prestige . She 's getting plenty of cash from the parents but refuses to reinvest it in the school . Working for Sheikha Aisha is a miserable experience . Now that she has turned the day to day operations over to Mr. Ali as Head of Secondary Girls and Mr. Farouk as head of secondary boys , the school will take a dramatic downward spiral . -LRB- As an aside , both Mr. Ali and Mr. Farouk have in the past been taken to the police for assaults on students . These assaults took place during normal school hours . Members of staff intervened in order to stop the altercation from becoming a brawl . Yet , they remain thanks to the Sheikha . -RRB- Unless you want to work for and be sponsored by a woman who has zero integrity , no qualms about breaking a contract and no ethics , run a million kilometers in the opposite direction . No one of any repute should ever consider working at this school .
Wow susan . . those are pretty inside stuff you 're bringing out . I 've my child going to sherborn in reception and so far i 'm pleased with the teacher and school system . Though this is my first year and i 've yet to explorer . but my child is happy . I guess what ever happens in the background as long as it does not direclty effect the teching Quality . but assaulting the student is a serious crime if this is true .
We are all looking for the same standard of education they we get at home , and if we are putting our children into a private school , then the standard should be even higher . Not seeing this with Sherborne , they are doing what all the other schools do and that 's drop the level because they have too many 2nd langugage students . Sherborne , is being filled with too many children to soon just to but bums on seats , and running on it 's reputation from the UK . It has no western admin staff , a balance would nice . Why is that private schools are running with 22 + in class , in England a private operates with 12 maybe 15 . The homework is shocking , no grammar , no comprehension , no maths , science , history , french , geography yet to had this term ... thinking about moving my child if things do not improve .
keep your cat fights inside the school itself
V.good stuff , but crowded classes

Be prepared to pay all the fines . You need to make sure that you can legally rent it before doing anything .
Make a contract before you give on rent or you ' l have to face various problems . Also , personal renting is not recommented .
Its illegal , you can give it to a friend , but if something happen you will be responsible ... good Luck
I believe my first choice is e-max & LuLu hyper , where you can get more choices to select & of course with the good price too .
For brand go for Asus , solid built netbooks . Good system for work and play .
2800QR is enough for a good one . I suggest Jarir and PCOne -LRB- Salwa -RRB- . Their after-sales support is excellent .
do check out city centre as well ...
You can find a good laptop in this price . choose one from lulu or carrefour in best price
Dear , Go to LULU Hyper , u will get HP laptop for Qr .2000   - . Happy Shopping .

Yuzu , I 'm aware of Canada pissing UAE off , I was living in Dubai when it happened . I do n't need a visa if I 'm transiting . Well that 's what I was told .
LOL ! Sure ! And I 'll bring a box of timbits for the kids . :-RRB-
Yes let 's !
Ok as long as someone pays my way ;p . i am free to go
I was in similar situation and traveled to Dubai twice. :-LRB- Dubai airport is large , but its depends on the terminal . The one for flydubai is tiny and no boarding bridge like Doha airport . BTW , are u Canadian ? Canadian passport holders can not get on-arrival visa to enter UAE since Jan 2011 . Still be able to get Bahrain visa on arrival but cost 5BHD .
Oops I meant between Dubai and Bahrain !
Choose the one with cheaper airfare if you are just going to return from the airport . Bahrain airport is much smaller than Dubai so you can get in and out quickly , that is the only difference I can think of .
Bahrain is better with small children , being a small airport . Dubai is a Giant Airport even for just transfer sake .
I 'm looking to book a flight that arrives in Bahrain at 9 h30 and departs at 9h35 . Is that cutting it short ? I 've been to Dubai airport and I agree it 's huge , but never been to Bahrain .
My thoughts exactly , but why would they offer that if it 's not feasible ? I 'm panicking I do n't want to spend my day in an airport .
Depends how young your children are . There is absolutely nothing for them to do at the Bahrain airport , they might have a bit more fun at the Dubai one .
bahrain has a restriction of only 12-18 hours unsure about the exact details but thats where i send my employees when their Visa needs to be changed
Oh for goodness sake . Just take a FlyDubai flight out and come back ...
it 's located at street 48 , but i dont know the gate . burt please do n't you ever try `` NATSCO Garage '' at street 25 . they will check your car and they will charge you for Qr .700 just for checking only.the rest is history !
Village Auto is A-OK . I have been a regular customer for 2 years now and i have not had any bad experience from them at all .
got mine fixed at street 12 gate no. 122 . fixed my problem in one day . fast and reliable .
What problem ? Refilling the wiper washer fluid ?
its difficult , same like a trustworthy car sale person , or an honest insurance sales man . . those are a contradiction and difficult to find .
No Mr. Lincoln ! its not a wiper fluid refill . Mechanically i am looking only at changing the timing belt and the axel boots in the front . I am keen to do cosmetic work on the cruiser . Complete body re-paint and polish ... but i am looking for someone who does a really really neat job . Most of the paint shops out there just want to get the job done and are not overly concerned about the quality . As a customer , my top concern is the quality and finishing . Any suggestions guys ? Any phone numbers would be appreciated . cheers
Hi fr8rain - would you have a number of somebody at the village auto ? thanks

I personally know of some top branded car dealership workshops who take the cars from the customers and send it to these shady garages to reduce their cost , then they stamp their seal and call it ` Agency maintained ' , but they rip off the customer 20 times more than the roadside garages too . And i cant agree more about the 90 % roadside mechanics all over the industrial area . None can be trusted .
Garage Al - Kuwari He is A-one mechanic working in Doha from last 20 years Mr. Arshad 44601466 cell # 66587300
Rizks , I have Honda SM600 ... 1966 model : D
Talhaamir . . very true i got my car done at Al-Kuwari the second time i was caught on accident . plus whatever you ask them to check they will do for free !
Try mysore garage on street 48 gate 18 here is their website www.mysoregarageqatar.com its still a new garage but a few of my buddies have gone there to have major repairs done -LRB- JEEP wrangler engine rebuild - 1 year no problems so far . runs good , Caddy SRX Transmission repair -RRB- and had them done in good time at a fraction of dealership price . We also just bring our cars in for the maintenance stuff too , it is a few extra streets but they have reasonable prices and the main thing is I know I can trust these guys . I had a breakdown once and they arranged the tow and shuttled me back home and everything , they really do care . you want to call this guy henry +974 55 85 6229 he 'll hook you up .
I went to Kuwari garage on street 18 . They didnt really get up from their lazy benches to check the car when i told them what problems i had or what changes i need . They just told me the price . Their price is good but they didnt guide me . Then i went to the newly established Maysore garare in street 48 . The guys there have worked in the actual dealerships -LRB- toyota -RRB- and the owner is also an ex-dealership workshop guy . They actually drover my car , tested all gears , lifted the car and i had 5 men checking every small detail . Then the told me what i really need and what i could do without . There was no extra charge for all this coz i told them i will do all my work with them . I had new spark plugs and a new fuel filter that i told them to replace and they did that for QR 110 . On top of all they all speak good english.I choose mysore over Kuwari anytime .
did i tell you that when i was looking for the Mysore garage on street 48 , i got totally lost and their owner came personally to pick me up from an agreed location , from where i followed their car . This is customer service !
It was a big problem to me to find the best garage , finally after many disappointments I found a honest & hardworking worker , he knew every single problem I show about my car , his garage is in wakalat street number 30 & I can give u his number 77819572 . . Try this garage & thank me !!!
Yes I agree , Armenia garage is the best & specially the workers there are genius they could fix my car which no one could repair it . . They r expert in electrical & michanic issues .

wo n't make the engine smoke , unless you burnt a hole in the piston , of something to that effect ... if the engine had an ECU system working at the time , if should not have happened at all ...
Do you want the engine programmed or blue printed ? These engines are not chipped by the way : o -RRB-
unfortunately I cant help but wanted to say what a beautiful car !!!
nice ride ... this is carburator or fuel injection ?
It 's a carburator below the air filter , man . There are no chips in those days , as brit said . You have to adjust the carburator . Maybe also the timing . And , and , and ...

He has a performance shop where he upgrades and work only with super engine cars . I know him in person and his passion towards racing cars in general and Ford in particular would probably entice him to find a way for solving your problem . -LRB- You might have to ship the car their or they have to come here with some of their electronic devices to calibrate the engine -RRB- .

Try the threestar workshop in industrial area street 24 - next to qatar technical inspection . But I would not drive this car - I just would put it in my livingroom and enjoy it ...
hey would u like to sell this car ... i like to buy it ...
My friend had the same thing with his 1966 Playmouth Barracuda , failed the technical check for blue and black smoke he went to Alkhraetiat there is a good shope for carburators there you might wan na try it , worked like a magic and passed the check . 67 shelby with 2010 engine might as well put a 7 disk CD changer in it . These cars come with crappy stereo system .
Thanks all for your help ... If anyone has any questions regarding buying the car they can pm direct :-RRB-
* drool mode * Samya you accept Western Union money transfer ????
Are you drooling over Samya or the Car ? :O -RRB-
Wow tats a booti !
yes ... dont worry ...
From where are you coming ? Flights from neighboring nations sometimes arrives 5 - 10 minutes early so try to do something worthy during this period too . Never mind , who needs a bath on the first day to work !
Do n't worry , I 'll shower before i board on the flight =-RRB- .
work on tourist visa ? Illegal . A fit case for deportation straight from the airport ...
Welcome to Doha & Good luck in your mission my friend !!!
petrol is cheaper than water , you should be asking about a car that doesnt break down and is easy to fix because mechanics here are just terrible , ive seen potholes smarter than some mechanics in Qatar
saed is right , here in qatar , we have to look for availabality of mechanics and cost of spare parts , for that , cars of nissan or toyota are best choice
<b> suzuki swift or corolla or alto or lancer or ... ... ... damn everything is expensive nowadays
by telling economic you mean everthing and not only petrol cost -LRB- spare parts , Maintenence , resell value , insurance & registration fees -RRB- , all are available in toyota cars . this is the situation in qatar only toyota everywhere even i do n't like toyota & i am not using toyota & i will never buy toyota !
If there are two Saeeds , then both are wrong ... hehehe
Camel . . Only grass he will eat.My very good friend Ssantro loves camels a lot . Moreover Camel will give you loving stares too sometimes not like a bumpy humpy car demanding to go to service after every 1000 miles or 2000 miles . Camel you can bath with water and nobody will object and if you will give shower to car all your neighbours will try to kill you by complaining to the authorities . Go for a camel .
Lucy . . camel will be too high to ride on , better to buy a donkey . But the big problem is where he can find grass for him ? Sure petrol here is cheaper than grass .
Can camel eat ... bread ... rice or vegetables : -RRB-
Ofcourse not u saedkhan . . u ' r always wrong
yo u ask me , i d say a nissan tiida , why ? well coz it has the best engine , lovely award winning 1.8 lt unit and also the most space than say a lousy corolla or nissan sunny or any other similar suzuki , and a great re sale value ... -LRB- avoid french or americans !! -RRB- ... plus hey the car is voted the best car many times over ... toyotas be it vios 's aygo 's or corollas and nissan sunnys and the suzuki lot are over rated ... final comment : - 2010 or 2009 nissan tiida 1.8 SE with alloy rims might not be as cheap as the others but thts value for ur money right there and a good investment
would be to buy a printing press ... .
you apply at Immigration on the appropriate form ... . it 's as simple as that !
which office ? what docs required ? how much i need to pay ?
Ist get the copy of passports and photos for your parents . Get a letter of your salary status from your employer -LRB- better in arabic -RRB- . Then go to immigration department in madina khalifa . There are typesets who will provide and type forms of visa application . After just follow their instruction that where and how to submit . Best of luck
so I suppose you have a `` not small '' company with a MAndoob . If you have one , talk to him to get an accurate answer -LRB- and if there is anything to clear , he 's just there in your company -RRB- . Or go to Immigration Office or visit their website -LRB- but I suggest you go directly -RRB- to ask for all the requirements
might take 1 month
It depends on the HR Manager , when he signs your Offer Letter and Releases it , Max it can take upto a Month ...
they are not interested
it does take time for overseas recruitment .
No time limits ... It could take more than 1 month to make ready final offer letter . then visa processing also can take another more than 1 month . but everything depends on various components ...
I think I will wait some more before taking a final stand ... issue is they are not very approachable over phone .
it depends Sometimes More than a Month ...
please advise as I am also waiting for their job offer , howver , I found the vacancy for which I was applying and been accepted is posted at qatar visitors . .
pease guyzz When did u get your written offer from QA After one month or more than it
cccccccccccccc
It will take almost 2 months for overseas recruitment ... Patience is virtue :-RRB- ... you have to wait : -RRB-
That 's way in the future . . Current concern is , `` Can Qatarliving servers take the load of all the 2022 threads '' : -LRB-

Can QL earth take so much load ? today 's forums all about similar topic
no problems . . qatar has more gas below the surface than it has oil ... so i guess the gas pressure is good enough to keep pushing things up ... : -RRB-
Better keep some spare life jackets and lifeboats . Zis time I do n't want to sink again ... I will escape wih my Rose darling .

There are no Notaries in Qatar and all such works are done by the respective Embassies and Consulates . You should contact the New Zealand mission in Saudi Arabia accredited to Qatar .

I am Canadian and had a similar problem . The British embassy did it for me . I am told that Canadians , Ausis , New Zealanders and Brits can resort to each others ' embassies in case there is no embassy of your country .
US embassy has one .
Thanks Boer . I have dropped the document off at the Thai embassy as they might be able to do it . If not , I will take you up on your kind offer . Cheers
Hi Suhail Shaker , You clearly have the luck of a Canadian -LRB- or maybe it was the Canadian charm ? -RRB- on your side . I tried the British embassy and did n't want a bar of it , as I was not British - even though both Canada and New Zealand are commonwealth countries . Thank you for your input though .
OK . Good to know . I used it to notarize US related business documents .
With the US embassy charging $ 50 a page -LRB- a disgrace and insult to every US citizen -RRB- , a public notary would be welcome alternative to this extortion rate . To add insult you even have to schedule an appointment to this raping price .
well said Qatarisun
Yes . It is one of the requirement of the Labor   immigration .
how come free visa where u can find free visa in Qatar are u sure ?
There is no free visa
There is no visa called ` FREE VISA ' All employment Visas are the same.Usually the sponsors will not allow those who are under their sponsorship to work for other compnaies , but some sponsors do allow to work for others by taking some rewards from the employees and these are referred as FREE VISAS .
THERE IS NO FREE VISA IN QATAR.you have to work with sponsor or with other sponsor with permission of govt or illegaly , that is not advisable .
What do you mean by `` FREE '' visa ?
Well there is No Visa Called Free Visa all Visas are employed Visa , the difference is only that the sponsor do allow you to work upon your choice for that you have to obtain a NOC letter from Existing sponsor which should be endorsed by Immigration Dept. its a permit to work in another sposorship which is valid for six month and than later on you have choice to change sponsorship according to your choice but the new visa does not allow you to change sponsorship until you finishes the first year ...

post it so we can see what it says , where is it from and other such important information . Ca n't really comment on it without knowing any of the facts .
i have not recieved a email to stat this but even if i had i would ignore it my kids never got a flu vaccine when we lived in uk so i wont be giving them one living here in doha but this is just my pereference
The SEC will issue consent forms for children to receive seasonal flu vaccinations . We understand that these forms will be issued on Sunday 4 October , to be returned on Monday 5 October . The intention is to begin vaccinations against seasonal flu as soon as possible . They confirmed that without the consent of parents they will not vaccinate children . H1N1 vaccine is not yet available more news from the SEC on this will be forthcoming in due course . The SEC have no plans to vaccinate adults in school at this stage .
I am not a medical person , and would like to know the advantages and dissavantages of giving this to my child , also if the advantage outways the dissavantage , because i would feel quilty if something happens to my child due to my refusal to give her this vacination .
Please all remember this vaccination is only for seasonal flu and not the H1N1 strain . SO think before signing do you really need it ? It will not protect your child from Swine flu . .

It amazes me that a Qatari asks such questions , thought they would no more than the rest of us . I suppose though Marriage is a death , either to the husband -LRB- slow and lingering -RRB- or to the wife if she changes her name , the birth of a new woman -LRB- already mature -RRB- and the death of the old as the name no longer applies .
No man , there is no such leave in labor law , U gon na take it from ur annual leave balance .
Not sure about Qatari Labour Laws , but our companys gives 7 days for such leave .
Depends on your company . . we get 10 days marriage paid leave : P

You can wear whatver you want as long as it doesnt draw attention to yourself . Clothes that cover you and dont show too much skin is ok . You can wear skirts or trousers or jeans or dresses . As long as there is not too much skin show anything is ok ... Welcome to Doha !
Yes I guess Tinkerbell has kind of summed it up . Skirts up to Knee roll are ok I guess . . :-RRB- Welcome to Doha
You have to remember that Qatar is a conservative Muslim Country by Law , but as with most places a lot of the rules are bent here . The one thing you have to remember which was states before you do not want to wear something that is to revealing so that people do not give you a hard time . For females you can wear whatever you want but then you have to deal with the after math of having inappropriate comments being made and in some cases harassment from both the people and the police . For men its is a lot easier but some times the same problems arise . So the best advice i can give is that you dress for the summer but nothing to revealing .
You can wear everything in moderation , as Qatar is a conservative country
You did better than I did , is yours non-stop ?

Short Cuts might benefit you only for a short period . There is no short cut to success according to me . If you have luck by your side , you can do miracles , if you dont then you need to struggle the hard way . Oil & Gas Industries dont have kids running the show , Professional experience and solid education back ground is need in these sectors . Good Luck
It is not necessary to have oil related experience or education to get a job in the oil industry . All kind of profesional is needed in the oil industry be it on IT , Engineering , legal , medical or even teacher .
1 - Find the names of as many oil companies and contractors as posible , prepare a good CV -LRB- Resume -RRB- using the best of your knowledge focus in what ever you know how to do best -LRB- do n't lie -RRB- , give a title to your CV -LRB- for example : HR officer , secretary , tea boy what so ever -RRB- now apply online and personally against all positions available related to the field you know best . 2 - Keep your phone with ya , you do n't want to missed a call !! while waiting for any interview appointments , go to get urself a good suit and polish your shoes lol -LRB- shave and cut ur hair -RRB- , you only get one chance to make a good impression and be lucky enough to have `` the golden opportunity to `` develope ur new career '' , be confident at all times . '' THAT SHOULD DO IT '' GOOD LUCK !
Yes confirmed , always Airlines ask you for return ticket to who ever come on visit visa in all GCC countries .
yep any visitor coming to doha from any country requires a return ticket
Return ticket is a must . Ask your travel agent and inquire the charges for change of flight schedule if your family want to extend their stay in Doha .
yes u have to take return ticket
why is it Pompous ? My thoughts are my own , but I doubt my Mum would agree with some of them .
U r welcome .

go to MOI traffic violation site , put your plate number then you will see if you got the violation or not .
I did , but I think it takes 2 days to appear . At least right now , there is no fine there .
Be patient for best results
There are cameras at the Tornado Tower intersection and at the CBQ Tower intersection near the General Post Office . You get caught if you jumped a red light . Good Luck .
I eventually did n't receive a ticket , which means that if you mistakenly cross the lights while orange on your side of the intersection , and become red by the time you reach the other end of the intersection , you should be fine .
What do you think ? Are they going to arrest every driver who ventures out this weekend ?
Dont worry about the safety of yourself or other road users . Its National day . Windows are for decoration and not actually looking out of .
Not on National Day .
my car has failed inspection twice now because it has stickers on the back window . They just overlook it every time when I renew the registration . As long as you pass the technical part of the inspection everything else is ok .
remember not to place it besides or near your plate no .
Do n't forget its National Day

Qatar Airways would be best .
Go for Emirates .
Try searching the net patiently for the dates of travel as the rates vary from date to date or else you can talk to some travel agents .
qatar airways is selling doh hou doh at the cost of qar5020 ... i am qr stff . . if you need more info ... you can cntct me by msg on Q L .
I 've got a really good deal from Doha-Detroit-Doha for only 3200 QR . You can try http:  www.kayak.com  . And I aggree with UKEng , Expedia.com will be good too . But , you need to have a credit card which is issued by Canadian US institution - that 's the drawback of expedia & cheaptickets . Good luck
best fare or best flight ... I once had a cheap KLM flight , through Amsterdam -LRB- a 24hour flight -RRB- I prefer the direct Qatar Airways flight -LRB- preferably in Business Class -RRB- It 's a direct DOH-IAH 17h flight -LRB- 10am to 5:30 pm same day -RRB- the flight back is a 15h flight -LRB- 7:45 pm to 7:45 pm next day -RRB- ... Timezone differences make the numbers seem illogical : -RRB-
Like mentioned before , Qatar Airways is the best bet . A flight from Doha to Houston will be around 1400 usd depending on the time of year you go . For example , a flight near Christmas time would be a couple hundred dollars more expensive . I 've searched taking a longer flight with layovers and it is always over a thousand more so it 's sooo not worth it .

Cabbage , been thinking though probably the modem router needs some cooling off.I 'm planning to give it a dip in ice cold beer .
Bathe it in a cool G&T - if that does not work - chuck it out - the router not the drink lol
Guys to check if there is a cable problem try going to www.pingtest.net and do a ping test . Click on Begin test and let it choose a good server automatically . check your packet loss , if high then cable issue . Then to check your download and upload speed go to www.speedtest.qa . I had some problems with mine , then changed the router and also found out my connection was downgraded from 4mb to 1mb and took them 2 weeks to fix that , but its all good now .
Cabbage , My dear i think the problem with my modem router is contageous.I would n't wan na be drinking that beer and then transfering the problem to me.Then you 'll be having a seantrump ' `` seantrump error , temporarily disconnected '' . Cabbage , i am selling my modem would you wan na buy it for like 250Qrs . A brand one costs 220Qrs . What do you say?LOL

@SMOKE : that QTEL Thompson Wifi Router 's username and password is : Uname : Administrator Pass : connect2th
newkidontheblock you mean if there is a static interference.I checked my line and its very clear.But still i 'll let some Qtel guys look at it .
sad true ... this thomson router from Q-tel does n't cover warranty replacement even . . sick ! my cheapo 3com granny router last 5 years shared with 5 people , till connection drop few months back and replaced with Belkin N series . . True Q-Tel ADSL team ca n't resolved the issue called them several times for replacement , it just ca n't happen . Do n't trust this Thomson from Q-tel . . it is really PIA . . go for Linksys , D-link , Belkin , 3com dual antena .
when you hard reset on your router , make you know your phone number which is your account as well with QTEL . usually for residences , it 's : s44xxxxxx and password : 123 for the new installed lines . usually for the older ones , just : s4xxxxxxx .
exactly ! hot and sexier when we get old ... -LRB- :
@Seantrump , call QTEL again to come then prepare CAT6 Cable from their main box to your ADSL -LRB- white -RRB- box inside the house . i dont how long the cable you will need . but they do n't provide it for us . that 's the problem with QTEL , not a full
newkidontheblock , thank you again for the advise.I 'll try the linksys router first then if it wou n't work i 'll have it checked.Appreciated
thanks so much , but unfortunately my own home gateway-fibre to home does not have a `` WLAN '' . I am surprise seeing that yours has it .
Thank you for the ping test - mine is ok although it could not measure my ` packet loss ' ; -
gore1876 , i really do n't know this small computer icon at the taskbar says `` speed 24MBps '' . I am not much of a computer wizz , earlier it showed 11MBPs and like a month ago it was 50MBps .
I had the same issue and it lasted for around 8 months till a very reliable and trusted FRIEND from around these parts helped me fix it . Ofcourse they had to come 4 times before it finally got fixed . But now i can view MOZAIC without any issues . in the past 2 days there was some disturbance but now even that is ok ... Thanks to that FRIEND ... : D
pls hw can i change my former wifi name and password in this new optic fiber router cos i normally change it when the old one was still available . . i ca n't see it in the setup page .
chaacha2005 , goto from your computer at home http:  192.168.100.1 login username admin password admin go to wlan tab change name and save
Even me , i am also facin the same problem ... dont know why ? But i usally switch off the main switch and restart ...
same here dude ... the effing thing just goes off , at times it shows connected but no web sites load .
Rizks , i tried all sorts of restarts and reboots , i thought the modem router is a bit hot so i wanted to give it an ice bath -LRB- that was a joke -RRB- .
I get it too :o-LRB- Go into the modem setup page . click disconnect . click Connect . Quick fix but still should n't be needed .
Rizks the price of the modem router is 220 QRs .
Ipagaling , thank you for that advise.I think i 'll get a linksys router modem . I 've used it before and its pretty good.But will it work with Qtel 's internet ?
Would another router work with Mosaic TV ?
Ipagaling , thank you buddy.Appreciated
The modem is aging with you sean ... go for a change ,
if its the damn routers problem , will Q-tel replace it with no charge ?
I think the signal from Q-Tel is the problem .
Rizks , they do . Replaced mine two times w o charges !
... but as you can imagine , nothing changed .
B2D , i tried that too.I tried every single trick in the book to have it fixed.i even made a new connection.i thought the problem might be my PC so i tried my other laptop , and my PC and my iphone it just disconnects . Guys , what if its not the router modem . What if there is a problem with the optical fibre line off land ?
Rizks , yes they replaced mine three times free of charge for only 220Qrs each time they changed it .
`` Free of charge '' ? And then you paid 220 QR each time they did ? That 's whatI call `` free of charge . ''
220 and tats Free of charge ? :-LRB- i wonder wots their Actual charge is then ? : -LRB-

If so many people are so disgusted by it , why does it persist ? Why does everyone just accept that this is the way things are in Qatar ? It just boggles my mind that management at all the major shopping centers fell no compulsion to offer clean and sanitary toilets to patrons , or that the municipality does n't enforce any cleanliness standards . I just do n't know how people can live like that .
this , unfortunatley is acceptable to some and some feckwit thinks that westerners are dirty by using bog roll ???!! Perlease !
Go to Disneyland where it is far more crowded than any place in Qatar and you wo n't smell any stink from Western people ! Here in Qatar it is such an ordeal to stand in queue in some public place or in huge crowd because of smelly stinky odor from certain folks who do not believe in washing their bodies and clothes before venturing in public Again , have you ever seen filthier bathrooms than here : Landmark , City Center , Waqif , Hyatt , Villagio , McDonalds , Burger King , ... . . everywhere !!!!! Why is Dubai so much better ? Why Mosques in Dubai are 100x cleaner than Doha ?????
I was staggered by the filth in the public toilets at Souq Waqif . I 'd rather piss against a wall than set foot in those toilets again . Whoever is ` running ' Souq Waqif is useless . The place is an utter embarrassment for tourists in that regard . If you want anyone to have a meal and spend more than an hour there , they will need toilets ... and this is the number 1 place to take tourists in Qatar ? I guess it 's a true reflection of the filthy attitude of many people in this country . No wonder western tourists hate the place .
All this talk of toiletary taboos might help explain the incredibly high rate of sterility amongst the local population . It ca n't be clean having so much urine and faeces swirling around on the floor , walls and misting into the air . Perhaps that 's why the local men and women have so much trouble conceiving .
fubar ??? most of the local families I 've seen have been HUGE ?
Hasan Shaikh said Yeah . In the western world , ... Yeah . In the western world , the toilets are clean , but people are not . @ Hasan Shaikh u said it
The people that are using water thinking to clean after them self , actually they are not cleaning them self at all . To get you self clean soap is needed . Those people only splash them self to get wet not to be clean .
and have a hand full of poo ... . ofcourse its a left hand , mind you ... Yikes !!!
I 'm always curious at the guys who like to linger by the urinals smoking a cigarette in the city center cinema toilets . We have names for men who like to hang around by urinals in other countries ...
That is why it is shark village big shark and big ass . no cleanliness. , it take months to finish to clean such biggest ass of shark lol .
toilets at city center and specially the cinema side are the worst i have ever seen in my life they stink even from far away
I have questions about the hose thing ... 1 -RRB- How do you know you have all the faecal matter off ?? So fingers physically touch faeces ? ... nice 2 -RRB- Do you use the paper afterwards to ensure all has been removed and to also dry off ones bum ? 3 -RRB- If one does n't use paper to dry surely it would cause soreness ? 4 -RRB- How come the water goes everywhere ? 5 -RRB- Surely the backsplash from the faecal urine filled toilet water lands directly back on ones netheregions ? I 'm not convinced ... one has to use paper somewhere along the line Water all over the floor which I dread to think what lurks in it is quite disgusting and unacceptable ...

in the public toilets ... because the person using do not mind others and sometimes , irresponsible customers just leave their mess without even cleaning and flushing afterwards .
Ohhhh , that says it all then ... . .
hasan you have GOT to be kidding me , what the hell are you on about only reason to why bathrooms stink here is not because of the people who use them , or the way that they use them , its because those shopping centers or hotels dont fork over the necessary money to keep them clean , no proper maintenance , cheaply build and no proper clean up staff ...
from a part of the world do their ` business ' in the bush or just along the roadside . . and here they are ... thousands died every year from cholera especially after flood . .
The Public toilets in Qatar are revolting . If they are not swimming in diluted shit , there 's 300 men with there hands and feet in the sinks , spitting in every direction . Yesterday I stood next to a man and his child in the toilets in City Centre , whilst they cleansed themselves in the Urinal . FFS , wheres the hygiene in that !!!
Where they do theirs . . ??
after travelling a bit in india . . i find the toilets in doha much much much better . . lolz . .
water must . . paper no way . . eeks
Recently I have visited Doha from Canada for two days . Three things caught my attention right away 1 . Water in public washroom , even at the airport . 2 . Speed limit and driving style 3 . I saw one kid -LRB- 2-3 yrs old -RRB- , with no child seat and seat belt on which was pretty scary . I think it is nothing wrong with using water in a washroom , this is just some people do not have courtesy to leave it clean for the next person . Qatar is one of the richest country -LRB- per capita income in 2007 was more than 80K i guess -RRB- on this planet , so it is fair to expect that everything should be nice and clean in this country . hopefully I did not hurt anybody 's feelings .
I 'm not saying that westerners stink ... but again I consider the use of toilet paper as an improper and inappropriate habit , this is dirty ! I prefer to see water spilled than a used piece of paper , or a roll that has been manipulated by dozens of fingers ... <aÂ href=http:  s464.photobucket.com albums rr6 dawestsidesscreaming ?action=view&current=291589im9sf5.gifÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http:  i464.photobucket.com albums rr6 dawestsidesscreaming 291589im9sf5.gifÂ border=0Â alt=Photobucket> < a>
Public toilets should have drains in the floors , and the floor should be built so the foul water flows into the drains rather than form puddles . I would equally complain if dirty bog-roll was left strewn all over the bathroom , so I think there 's no excuse for leaving excrement-laden spray covering the cubicle . However , the problem would be much less apparent if the water drained away properly .
Toilets in Doha are disgusting and a disgrace !!! When you arrive at Doha airport and want to use the toilets -LRB- speaking of the ladies ' of course , ca n't comment on the gents ' -RRB- the first impression of Doha is NOT GOOD !!! Only 2 toilet cubicles , both dirty and swimming in dirty water and overflowing bins . Why oh why ca n't they build decent toilets in this country ?? The toilets in the new malls esp . Villaggio are HORRIBLE !! Cheaply constructed from formica - water and dirty paper everywhere . Is it really so difficult ?? Go to the malls hotels   airport in Dubai and you can see the difference . Why ca n't it be the same here ?? I will do anything to avoid using public toilets here , which is sometimes very inconvenient , but I do n't want to bare my b * m to these hellholes !!
I think the worst I 've seen in any shopping mall are the gents loos in Landmark . There 's dried shit stains up the walls and dead roaches in the light fittings . It baffles me how anyone feels happy shopping for food after using those toilets .
lol ... ... . . I wish that were an option for me . lol
Westerners continue with your habit of using paper and not water ... This way we can save Water ...

In the 60 's the UK health department advised to use water hoses against toilet paper in the public schools in order to stop typhoid spreading among childrens , sorry I did n't find the link . And Hasan is right to a certain extend , you ca n't clean that `` place '' toroughly only if using water , this is common sense . I will not say westerners are dirty people , but I look at this type of hygiene - paper - totally disgusting . And a body with no smell does n't automatically mean a clean body . Use a whole roll if you want , this is nothing compared to a well guided water spray , lol ! <aÂ href=http:  s464.photobucket.com albums rr6 dawestsidesscreaming ?action=view&current=291589im9sf5.gifÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http:  i464.photobucket.com albums rr6 dawestsidesscreaming 291589im9sf5.gifÂ border=0Â alt=Photobucket> < a> Hardcore Gamer !
Could not have agreed more .
Water , Unlike in western world it is very essential in Asian countries ... For your knowledge here people clean with water not with paper ... and the thing about water being spilled here and there that is as princess said just ignorance and bad cleaniness manners ...
Alexa Agreed with your point ... western people are definately not dirty after using paper and remain dry after using toilets ... but atleast you should not point out or question like Comikalee did ... it is the way of life here ... people feel clean after using water ...

No way near enough if you have to pay your own accomodation . check QL classifieds to get an idea of the going rate for apartments . EVERYTHING here is more expensive , except for petrol . You need to be making a good deal more than you were in the UK .
Are you sure its QR .8000 ?

Just to give you a brief idea about living costs in Qatar , take a good look at these facts : 1 - Rent of a 1 bedroom apartment in a mid-class area is from 3,500 up to 4,500 QAR per month . Sharing an apartment with someone else may save you around 1,000-1 ,500 QAR per month . 2 - Renting a small car -LRB- 1500 cc -RRB- is around 1,500-1 ,700 QAR per month . 3 - Food costs for a single per month are around 800-1 ,500 QAR depending on what you eat and drink . The previous number increments if you drink alcohol . 4 - Going out on weekends costs around 200-300 QAR depending on what you do -LRB- that 's about 800-900 QAR per month -RRB- . 5 - Water and electricity bills are around 300 QAR per month . Any extra services like mobile and internet are at about 250 QAR each -LRB- that 's another 500 QAR per month -RRB- . Need I continue ... ?! I do n't think so . ********************************* <b> <i> Obstacles are what you see when you set your eyes off the goal .

You should call the Traffic Police and inform them about the accident to enable them to see the accident -LRB- but dont block the road if it is a minor accident -RRB- or both of the vehicles should be taken to the nearest Traffic Departmen . In this case both parties should agree who is responsible for the accident .
1 -RRB- Call 999 if you are on the accident spot ! 2 -RRB- In case the accident is minor and fault is accepted by either one , then you both may directly go to the nearest police station and you will get the report instantly . If third party was NOT involved in the accident & you damaged the car by yourself , you can follow the same procedure # 2 above .
you go to police station , bring your documents and get a police report . possible you need to take a number ? but that 's the procedure .
this is what happened . . on the 26th of january this guy was in a reverse and he hit me . . he admitted his fault and told me whatever the damage he would pay . . i thought that police report is not needed because we both agreed but i was wrong . . do i still need the details of his land cruiser ? he gave me his number and he is such a nice guy he would stick by his word but the service center says they wont fix a thing without a police report ? i need the location and office timing please .
I think you need to go to the police station located in the area of the accident . talk to the guy who hit your car , and agree on a time for meeting at the police station.I think both of you should be present at the station . explain the situation , you may need to pay a fee for paper work , and they may call you the following day for the report . Take your id , id copy , istimara , and insurance documents with you . Make sure that you clear any of your earlier radar fines , to get the report .
Call that guy -LRB- who hit your car -RRB- , and tell him that you will meet in the police traffic division - the nearest police traffic division were the accident took place , to whatever time you are both two comfortable of , since the traffic division is 24hrs , except i think there is no office during friday and saturday . . and if as you said the guy is the culprit then he should pay 100 plus 20QR for the report , and you as the victim will also pay 20QR for the report . . after that check with your arabic friend who can read and interpret the report -LRB- since the report is typed in arabic -RRB- , ask them what is the name of the insurer of the car who hit you , and google their contact nos , lastly go directly to their office -LRB- insurer -RRB- and give them the police report . . and the they will give you the details on what you will do next . . I hope that helps ...

`` Work for the same company '' ??? Then why did you resign at first place ?? It 's well and good that you got NOC . . You can work anywhere in DOHA , my friend . .
In Pakistan ...
Did you check local FOOD CENTRES first ???
Last time I brought it from Al Safeer , you can check with them in the deserts section .
You may find in Safeer Hyper market on D-Ring road , but small size Kewda water bottles only .
I checked everywhere but could not find , in Indian stores they have Indian kewra which is diluted with water which is not as effective as Pakistani one because Paki kewra is pure oil its one drop is enough for one dessert . I 'll check in Safeer hyper . Thanx
Indian kewda is also good , provided you get a good quality -LRB- Conentrated -RRB- from northern part of India . Let me know if you dont find in Safeer

They will stamp your passport once your RP is revoked .
the stamp on ur passeport wo n't affect ur chances in recruitement elsewhere than in doha . if ur leaving doha to dubai , no problem at all if they stamp it . good luck .
Now days anywhere in GCC -LRB- Including DUBAI -RRB- did not allow duel residency -LRB- Work visa -RRB- so you must cancel your visa from here -LRB- QATAR -RRB- , otherwise you have to stay in your home country morethan 6 months -LRB- automatically cancell your visa -RRB- You may stay 6months or more on visit visa in DUBAI .
You must get your Qatari RP revoked if you want to take up a job in Dubai . You ca n't have RP in two GCC countries . All the best
i mean cancelling the visa after i leave qatar . There is no cancellation stamp in the passport but the company will cancel once i leave . Will it create any problem if i get in to Dubai with working permit .
It is necessary to get your visa cancelled and cancellation stamped on your passport . This cancel page is a requirement for making a new work visa , if you still want to work in the GCC .
Mr.Nofal , visa ca n't cancell while you are out of QATAR , either it you stay more than six months or your visa expire while you are out ... I hope you got my point
Ya Ms Sabeera i got you , but they have cancelled visas after the candidate left the country , they say that filling the cancellation form and handing over to immigration department the cancellation can be done . They said they are waiting for the emir to sign so when he comes and signs the cancellation will be done and they said they would send a copy of cancellation being done .
I doubt the Emir has anything to do with cancelling of visas , unless you are working directly for him ... he has plenty of lacky 's doing his leg work .
I am sorry , its mudhir not emir . I reconfirmed this with my boss 2 to 3 times , i said if i don get my cancellation i would come back to cancel , he said it would be done in 3 days time after i leave .
<p> my sponser told me he cancell my Visa and I am out of qatar . As in MOI it says it is valid till 2012   7   27 . < p> <p> I want to travel to qatar , what will happen to me ?? pls help me < p>

Thank you very much KL .
Thank you very much KL .
completely forgot about the sports day holiday ... since this year was the first time it was granted ;-p Compared to South Africa , there are hardly any Public Holidays in this country ... There , I think we have about 17 18 days a year , over and above annual leave and sick leave ...
In my offer letter they have mentioned that i will be eligible for 20 days paid annual leave after my probation and in 2 intervals . Is this normal ? I mean 20 days paid leave is fine ? or shall i ask for more ? Please advice . .
You wo n't get more . 20 days is by law . The two intervals is interesting . Mandi
You can ask . If you are applying for a CEO , COO or VP position they might consider doing it . But if all the perks you are getting are mandatory under Qatar law then I doubt they will be doing you any favors . Mandi
there no limit on sick leave actually . see http:  counselqatar.com sick-leave-annual-limit
check this out . . http:  www.qatarembassy.net Qatar_Labour_Law.asp
are 3 days first eid 3 days second eid 1 day National day there are also 3 holiday days given by your employer at his discrestion . I think you are intitled to 10days sick leave per year , unless you are hospital bound , then I think its up to 3 months , but that part I am not sure about .
The below leave is subject to your company 's policy Sick leave - 14 days with pay Extended sick leave - 28 days with half pay 2 months maternity leave 30 days annual leave 1 day - National Sports Day Eid 1 : 3-7 days -LRB- subject to company 's discretion -RRB- Eid 2 : 3-5 days -LRB- subject to company 's discretion -RRB- 1 day - Qatar Independence Day
In my offer letter they have mentioned that I shall be granted 20 working days per annum , which may be availed after probation period in 2 intervals . Is it like , I can only take 10 days leave every single interval ? What if i want to extend the leaves ? Is there any law or rule that is specifc to my question . . Thanks ,
Thanks for your reply . . I am not sure but I heard that employer keeps last one months salary , if we wish to go to our country on vacation . Is it true ? Thanks ,
I hope not , that would be illegal . Mandi
how about the benefits once you completed your 2 years contract . is there any end of service award given as per QLL . .

You could probably catch crabs in the watering hole in the Sheraton .
My friends catches crabs at Wakra sealine area . However , I 've seen their catches , it 's small crabs but good in volume .
Go to Fish Market near salwa road
simpleej , In your country , I caught crabs at the glass houses . Once in Itaewon , once at T Street in Pusan and once at Chagal madong in Taegu . Oh yeah , several times in Dongduchon and Ouijangbu . You can keep th Seafood !
go semisima mate , but make sure there is no moon light otherwise there will be no crabs . . good luck
Drive safe your family is waiting for you .
I 'd guess as with most countries you can drive them on private land -LRB- with the owner 's permission -RRB- . If you want to use it along Salwa Road and have a death wish - feel free ! At the end of the day , we all see people on quad bikes with inadequate lights and no protection on the roads here at times , so why not a mini bike ? Whether you get away with it will depend on your nationality ! I trust you take out life and third party insurance before you start ! Mini bikes on public roads in the UK set a bad example for the `` real '' motorcyclists so it wo n't be any different here . Your call ...
ow . . but . . i only play at large field near the road . . i know its not allowed to ride in main road . . but . . can i ride in field ?
I believe it would dammage your lamda sensor
Look in you car 's user manual . it will tell you there what -LRB- minimum -RRB- octane to put in it .
hi nothing will happen my friend believe me it happened to me so many times but now my friend keep it till the red light mark in ur car then return back to premium good luck
it will increase the life of engine
A higher Octane rating does not have any effect on cars with a normal compression rating . High Performance Cars got usually a higher compression rating and therefore have to withstand knocking -LRB- detonation -RRB-
just use 95 or 97 octane ... others will harm the engine ... also check your manufacturer 's manual ...

Is that a `` Beautiful room '' mate ? or Beautiful `` Room mate '' ?
city center , i am thinking of 5K but not sure , i have a post about it if you are interested
can I kick him her out ? I feel like I am obligated to have a long term contract or something , otherwise the person would be in trouble . I do n't want him her to face a situation to find another apt urgently in the middle of the year ...
In that case . . use your roomate 's ` Tide ' & wash it alongwith his pillow cover before gifting it back to roommate permanently . .
Do n't do it !!!!! If you find a Westerner like yourself maybe . Or if you know and like the person before you move in together , that could be cool . I lived with someone from a different culture and when it was just us within the four walls of a fairly spacious apartment , it was like each individual culture was fighting for domination with no middle ground . That did n't make for the laid back , bohemian , respectful atmosphere I had hoped for . I say Do n't do it !!!
If it is to save some money ... doesnt matter . . however you can define the ground rules in the beginning itself with the notice period for kick out option ... :-RRB- If it is for the sake of company ... DO N'T DO IT . P.S. : Above options applicable for Male roommate only ... :-RRB-
I wish i could change here for another one , , she drives me up the wall , , , , i cant stand her
My room mate is going , now i think will i get the new room mate same like him , he was a good human being offcource .
make sure you find someone that has the same ideas as you . I would suggest going out and relaxing over dinner and chatting . My housemate and I get on well . I found her through a friend of mine . She is the same nationality as me . She works for Qatar Airways in a management position , so she travels alot ... which is a bonus as we both get our space . You must have the same or similar out look to life ... or you will be butting heads constantly .
Besides sharing lungis , trying to act busy and unavailable when cleaning and tidying up has to be done in the room but right on time when free food or sweets are to be shared , excuses and regular delays when his part of the rent is due , has bad stories and gossip about others but never himself and the list just goes on and on ...
When roommate borrows your underwear ... & returns it back next day .
you wo n't have a privacy - when you need it .
painful , when you share a room in Doha Jadeed :O -LRB- Anyway , to the OP . . Do your homework and make sure you can put up with each other . . Good Luck !
When roommate borrows your underwear & returns it back next day , remember : `` yellow '' in the front and `` brown '' in the back
I understand , it brings some monetary benefit among others . . but how the location has any relation with painful events if any ?
I applied last sept 30 and still waiting for my visa .
It took me 3-4 days . Apply on Sunday and by Wednesday you get a message to collect the passport . It sometime takes time to get an appointment but since you 've already done that and if your details are fine it should be 3-4 days
I suppose it also depends on Nationality . Mine took two working day . And surprise of surprises , my sponsor went and it took him a month and also an interview .
it will take 10-15 working days .
so you better re-schedule ...
you should have used priority service -LRB- 3 days -RRB- wait for 2 weeks minimum
is commercial cum residential complex . A lot of different kind of businesses including a school is located within the Barwa Village . A friend of mine live there . He has no complaint so far . Nice and spacious apartment with quality finishes and prompt maintenance .
I live there , and it 's good generally , but here are some of the issues we are facing : - there is no playground   park for children to play in . - since the airport is not far so if u keep ur windows open u will be annoyed by the planes noise -LRB- especially in night & when the weather is good and u do n't want to keep the AC on -RRB- - public transportation is limited -LRB- there is a bus coming regularly to the village but taxi cars are very few especially in the morning -RRB- welcome to Doha , neighbor ! : -RRB-
it has a medical centre , gym , mosque , school , a very good shooping centre -LRB- centrepoint -RRB- and other shops and restaurants ... there was a small playing area for children near a restaurant there with jumping castle etc. , but i donno its there now or not.airport park is 5-10 mins drive , yes , airplanes noise is irritating especially the jets ... but u ' l get used 2 it
you have almost everything in barwa village ... i have relatives there and i am going for an overnight sleep there every weekend ... just to relax ...
is Mega Mart super market , car tyre   alignment shop , open spacious ` green field ' town among other points .
Its an ideal place to live in with respect to : a -RRB- size of the house & its rent as compared to the market b -RRB- shopping complex within the compound c -RRB- hospital within the compound d -RRB- school in the compound ur lucky to find a house there since my friend applied more than 8-9months ago and he still hasnt gotten a response from them due to high demand . I hope urs is a 2 bed room apt , considering the size of your family Rest dont worry about anything its in the midst of the city , NOTHING to worry about at all . . just focus on your movement and Inshallah all will be fine ! Good luck
Thanks so much for all your really helpful comments so far . Just another question , whats the traffic like in a morning and in an evening when travelling in and out of Doha ? Just wondering how long the school commute may take ?
Why do n't you renew your passport ?
I am in Norway right now and would be coming to Qatar in few days . I dont have time to renew my passport in Norway that y i wanted to know this information .
You can just add pages to your passport . Mandi
My employer told I need to have atleast 4 empty pages . So I guess 4 Pages . Good luck
so what exactly are u trying to tell us ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . .
come on guys , i think u didnt get the question . My passport is almost full , it has visa perments from different countries , and now i am left with only 3 empty pages . When i was in kuwait they used 3-4 pages on the work residence perment , therefore i wanted to know would these empty pages be enough for the WP RP for Qatar . If this is bit difficult to understand for you flying birds tell me so i can make more simple .
one page is more than enough
My husband 's employer required six empty pages in his passport as a condition of his arrival . I do n't think they used all of them though . Mandi

thanks I am listed with QR 500 I saw that but I want to know where to go to see the picture from the speed camera as I am not sure if I was on the road the time date the ticket was issued .
timebandit , I wish I owned the site , but I do not . I was hoping to find something like it to use to make purchases .
Ebay is good . . two things . mind where you are buying the stuff from . if you are buying from china or Hongkong , then the seller would ship the item to Qatar with HK post which is cheap and most of the times he offers it free , but the wait time is minimum one month and 45 days is normal . you can opt to get it by HK registered post too with additional shipping cost ranging from $ 4 to $ 20 , which is much faster and secure . if you are buying from other countries like US , the standard shipping is done with USPS which is no better than HK post , its take a month too , alternatively if you opt to get it shipped with UPS DHL FedEx from the buyer , then price for shipping ranges anywhere from $ 140 . alternatively to buy from the US seller is Easyshop by DHL , or shop n ship by Aramex . check their website to know how they work .
Thanks , shyams . I am thinking of trying the one I listed above just to see how it works . I think it is in Qatar , so the shipping may be better . I think I will try to sell something first , because the site looks so new - there are n't too many things to buy . I 'll let you know how it goes .
you are welcome . . till now I havent seen any ebay seller from Qatar ...
mojo , how did the buyers back out ? That kind of stinks . So did they or did n't they get sold in the end ? I want to list something and I suppose it 's free so I would n't lose anything ...
backed out in a sense that ... they had not read the specs well , though I had them listed , their issue was with the processor of my laptop and also under the assumption that it was with a video card . . which it was n't . But for me to list it there again , is because I believe it will work . . if not now then some other time . mojo1981
I signed up , but have n't listed anything yet .
Let us know how it goes , will you ?
Well to be honest geekgirl ... I just want my items to be sold . . and will try various avenues till it gets sold . . and being free is an added bonus . The thing I feel while being in Qatar is that unlike back home in Australia or anywhere else a lot of people know what auctions are ... its yet catch up here !! mojo1981
the real meaning of Auction is to catch up here ... the reason 1 . the country is small , you can always call up the seller directly and negotiate the price . 2 . can always drop in to check the stuff yourself . 3 . the price . 4 . Options
I agree Shayams . . for me to give an update , I had used the qlassified.com as an avenue to advertise and sell the items . What has happened so far is that a resident in A-Khor community bought my HP laptop for a price that was favourable to me ... but in the end I sold . As mentioned earlier my end goal would be to sell my unwanted items through any means ... the site I would is doing is job as intended . I do hope more people would start putting up their stuff as well ... as the concept is good while its in Qatar . Again thats too much text before I head off to Ras Laffan . mojo1981
It would be good , especially , for people who prefer to not meet in person . I get nervous setting up a meeting with someone I do not know . An auction site might be a good idea as a `` middle man '' .
great shopping on ebay . . i had done several times ... shipping cost should be mention on item description , if not just ask the seller ... but be careful on reading the fulll description carefuly , regarding like warranty , refund , exchange , damage , geniune , new or used etc. . .
i think thats hectic for a place like qatar . especially the shipping costs and the time taken to arrive . why dont you try any local shops like home centre or homes r us if its for furnitures ? there are a hundred other shops in salwa road for furnitures , household items etc etc etc. wats that u exactly wan na buy ? -LSB- img_assist | nid = 17892 | title = http:  braveatheart.blogspot.com  | desc = | link = none | align = left | width = 180 | height = 135
I use eBay in conjunction with Aramex for shipping . Some sellers on eBay will ship direct to Qatar as well . You will need to decide if it 's wiser to spend the extra on shipping or perhaps buy locally . Aramex are a cost effective shipper from the states and the UK . When you join their Shop & Ship service they give you a postal address in the USA and UK . You have you items delivered to that address , and then they forward your goods to a depot here at reasonable rates . I do n't think selling items on eBay is a viable option from Qatar . But somebody else may think otherwise . <aÂ href=http:  www.imdb.com title tt0081633 Â title=IÂ LoveÂ Photography> <imgÂ src=http:  www.blodyn.net images photographer.gifÂ width=65Â height=64Â alt=IÂ loveÂ photographyÂ  > < a>
i have done it for many times , EBAY is trustful as far ranking is concerned , i have received many items through some cheaper means , PM me if interested ! : -RRB-
http:  www.qlassified.com It looks like a new site , just getting started . It 's like ebay , but FREE - and it 's in Qatar . I sold on ebay before I moved , but this looks like a good option . What do you think ?
I will be shopping when I get there and was wondering about online shopping vs. stores .
We 're puting the finishing touches to qbay.com and recruiting now .
we sincerely hope qbay would be popular and gain masses . best wishes .
How will qbay be the same different from ebay or www.qlassified.com ?
Just cover your shoulders and your knees - no sleeveless or see-through tops , no shorts , no super-tight clothes . That said , you 'll see them here and there , but I feel it 's best to respect the local customs . Expat Sueo

Novita , where are the daily aerobics fitness listings ? I 'm back and desperate for a work-out ! Mandi
Mandi ! i only put for the month of October . That was quoted from Qatar Happening book for the month of October . I just got November edition yesterday ... as soon as i got the time i will put it down on QL Calendar . You really looks good ! You dont need a workout Mandi .
No , U do n't have to .
There is no Dress code in Qatar . There is Dress code in Saudi Arabia i.e women have to wear abhaya -LRB- a black cloth with or without design -RRB- on top of what they wear . I do n't know abt head cover in Saudi but have seen ppl wearing just abhaya and not covering head .

You do n't have to cover your hair however people ARE expected to respect local norms and customs pertaining to dress . If you follow Expat Sueno 's post you should be fine . Ibrahim Fletcher

If you have a Special K meal you will lose weight because you will have a lower calorie intake . Should work .
And to check calories in your food , go for -LRB- www.nutritiondata.com -RRB-
It can work but the danger is to re-gain the weight once you go back to your normal diet . If you just want to loose a few kilos to get inside a dress why not -LRB- but our bodies do not like very much this kind of games :--RRB- . For a healthier diet , change your way of eating by taking out the extra -LRB- extra quantity , extra sugar and fat -RRB- and add the good ones -LRB- fruits , vegetables and exercise -RRB- . You may not loose weight as quickly but it will last . Check your BMI kg m2 -LRB- Body Mass Index -RRB- , decide what BMI you want to reach -LRB- to be healthier and or to fell better -RRB- and allow you some time to reach it . http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Body_mass_index And whatever you do -LRB- diet , exercise -RRB- , you have to enjoy it , if not one day or another you will swap to your old habits :--RRB-
Do n't replace your meal with special K . It is high in sugar and is made from simple white flour . If you insist on eating cereal instead of a normal meal then try eating one that reduces its sugars slowly . i.e. less refined and more complex carbohydrate . Dorset muesli for example with nuts and unprocesses grains . With the simple carbs in special K you will just get an insulin spike and feel hungry soon after . Generally if you want to lose weight then reduce your carbohydrate and increase green vegetables . So less potatoes , rice , pasta and as much green vegetation as you can manage .

there are lots of places you can get a fully accredited degree part time by distance education . For example , since you are on the web , search for Athabasca University -LRB- it 's in Canada -RRB- . It 's worth it to get your degree , hang in there !
University of South Africa , recognized globally and a lot cheaper than the US long distance universities . www.unisa.ac.za . You write the exams at the British Council .
tXZ bOER
Contact the National study centre in MES . They will assist you . They have many distant education degree programs from differnt universities in India . Exams are conducted by the respective university here in Doha under the supervision of the Indian Embassy good luck
Check with MES off campus . they offer distance education like B.com , BA , BBA , BBM etc. . from various Indian Universities like IGNOU , MGU , Calicut Univ etc. . Classes -LRB- Doubt clearing session -RRB- will be on weekends , 2 hours.Friday -LRB- 8-10AM -RRB- and on Saturday -LRB- 6.30 PM to 8.30 PM -RRB- QAR 2500 per year including books for most of the degrees . Or try in NEC -LRB- National Education Center -RRB- They also offer the same degrees . But they have got more classes than MES and they charge 3 or 4 times more as well . . Best of Luck !
go back and study ... ... . . Or do from Open universities . IGNOU

Yateem Sunglases store is the best . I am not his relative or hisa patner or working with him , or his suplier . I am only his customer snce long time especially for sunglasses . once I was attracted by one store making buy one get one . I had a very big hard experience with the way that salesmen behavior . they do n't want you to concentrate to purchase or get your free one as you like . I strongly suggest yateem or Qatar optics are good . and maybe there are so many good stores I di n't mentioned I apologize . and for the store I had not been satisfied I tell soon or lator you will discover that you need to change sales managers and some sales men for their bad performance .
You can find several sunglasses shops at City Centre . Solaris , next to Giordano is newly opened . You can also try Qatar Optics .
I wonder if you are after the best sunglasses or the best store price wise . If you have a specific brand in mind then city center has few big stores you can try .
if u fly via emirates airline , they could arrange a visa for u at an additional cost
if you have a work permit of qatar , then you get visa on arrival , I think the fee is 100Dhs

Doha Dental Complex . Montazah st. right after its junction with C-ring road go to the service road it will be on your right . Dr. AbdelNafe3 elSibaei ; one of the very few competent and honest dentists here who will not add extra fake work just for money .
By the way , I 'm not promoting a fellow Egyptian Doctor or so -LRB- he 's not Egyptian -RRB- on the contrary , this Queen clinic are mostly Egyptians ; they are still competent but tending to overwork everything just for money that is not necessarily for your brnefit .
Try Apollo Clinic in Al Mansoura . Dentists & Asst. Dentists are good and fees are not high -LRB- i.e. Dental filling QR200 . -RRB-
Al-Ahmadani dental clinic is very good , doctors there are great and helpful the prices are good . Its in the Ali bn jabor and sons building , and if u cant afford the price they make great discounts.they r really very nice people
Best clinic is Queen Clinic , there is a branch in Villagio . The back entrance of Villagio , it 's obvious . And there is a branch in City Center , at the parking lot . -LRB- Ask about it there -RRB- . About the prices I do n't really know if it 's considered expensive or reasonable . My parents are regular clients there , and it 's excelllent ; with a very well experienced and professional team . The owner of the Clinic is Doctor Mamdouh Fareed . He is the best of all doctors there . Go check it out anyways . Good luck !

All Qataris I know have cooks from India . So , Qatari Cuisine is Indian Cuisine . Some add joghurt and it becomes Turkish Cuisine . Others order from a Lebanese restaurant .
On the weekends there is 2 Qatari ladies selling home made Qatari food outside like `` Harees '' and other nice dishes , it may be worth going and having a chat with them and trying their yummy food :-RRB- <imgÂ src=http:  www.qatarliving.com files images Qlip_0.jpg>
Balhambar Restaurant , down at the Cornish , has a Qatari Buffet . I enjoyed very limited dishes there , but hard to remember the names or even the ingredients . You may want to visit Souk Wakif , there is pure Qatari food corner there . I remember dishes like Tharid , Harees , Mashhool -LRB- rice and chicken -RRB- thats it . They also eat dates and a kind of dumpling . Maybe Aisha , bleu , qatari-princess and Diamond can help you on this one . Salam

Indeed they can
yes , you can and they can ... Qatar does n't ban single women from working . The issue would be not with your gender but with your visa . Since you 're on the visit visa you need to find job company that will provide with the residence permit before your current visa expires or else a fine of 200QR day for overstaying . Good Luck !
Yes u can ,
surely ummarried girls can work but the fact is that since ur visa is visit visa u have 2 first chng ur visa status 2 a firm then only u cn work becaus emost of the firms prefer females with family sponsorship ie husband father status .
It is good for growing children but depends how and when it is consumed ... Recomendations A -RRB- Early B Fast B -RRB- Early Dinners Better to consume with more olive oil -LRB- Organic Extra Virgin , First Cold press -RRB- as a topping add on . Two Three times a week is ok if your staple food is not lentil based . I assume you will be buying it from famous Hamous guys -LRB- Beruit -RRB- , order it without oil and use your own olive oil as recomended above . Hope this helps

This is taken from Wikipedia Nutritional information Lebanese hummus , garnished with whole chickpeas , on a Yemeni serving dish . Hummus is high in iron and vitamin C , and also has significant amounts of folate and vitamin B6 . -LSB- 23 -RSB- The chickpeas make it a good source of protein and dietary fiber . Depending on the recipe hummus carries varying amounts of monounsaturated fat.Hummus is useful in vegetarian and vegan diets and like other combinations of grains and pulses , when eaten with bread it serves as a complete protein .

You may wish to fly out on 25th Oct Thurs. and return on 3rd Nov Sat . at max .
That ca n't be right . I thought private sector workers only got three working days off .
u can fly out 23rd night becoz 24 will be arafat it should be off.u have to be ready for work on 4 th of november . -LRB- government employees -RRB- private sector wil get only three working days off.i guess
What is Arafat ? To be clear . It 's my first year here and I work in the public sector . I need to know what days I get off . I have heard it is three working days . Please can somebody confirm the dates .
Some people wo n't get any days off -LRB- workers in shops , domestic workers , taxi drivers etc -RRB- . Some people will get 1 or 2 days off . Some people will get 10 days off . It just depends who you are and whether your manager likes you . There is no hard and fast rule about who will definitely get a certain number of days off .
I agree that is the case in reality . However , Qatari Labour law -LRB- Law 14 -RRB- does make specific provision for Eid Al-Adha holidays . For private sectors workings it states that you should get 3 working days off . If your manager insists on you working those days , then you are entitled to 150 % of your salary for those days . I do n't want to resight labour law , as these laws are not always adhered to . I just want to know which 3 days this will be this year if your manager just so happens to be a really nice guy and gives you the days off as per the 3 day requirement .
Depending on school requirement , skills , subject , , , , and how your is your luck ...
i think its deal about you & school staff if private school .

hhhaaa ... Buddy , do n't u remember our schooling days ??? we all were somewhat same like ur kids . . Not wanted to wake up early after spending long vacation ... Or always used to give lame excuses to the parents ... WOW , WHAT A WONDERFUL THOSE DAYS WERE ?? Just be calm friend . . They r kids after all . . They will adjust soon . . Try to make them understand with ur love and not by yelling on them . . It may give opposite result . . It does happen with we adults as well coz of the wintery feel in DOHA from december to february-march . . We too feel lazy to wake up for our office sometimes ... So be chill ...
soniya , you did n't understand my post . I did n't take the vacation as I took just a couple of months before in summer . Its not due to long vacations but due to falling temperatures kids are reluctant to wake up . Hence I feel vacations should not be disturbed to facilitate parents or teachers . Do you justify taking vacations in advance ?
`` But my kids now finding it very difficult to wake up for school . ''
blablabla , i had written that coz of this utter cold temperature kids r bit reluctant to wake up . . Kindly read my post again . . Its not even with the children but it happens to adults as well . . We feel bit lethargic during winter . . So its natural , the kids will feel same . . My daughter is still small to go for school . . But i can understand ur problem . . Noone can force schools to go as per one 's own wish . . School authorities r fully responsible towards their children . . So evenif i want to justify my stand on vacation , its not gon na to sort out the problem . .
blablabla do they get 8 hours of sleep at night ?
and there is no logic in blablablas argument . you make the kids sleep at 9 or 10 . and if they get up at 5 , they get 7-8 hours sleep , which is not bad . Is it the kids find it difficult to get up or the parents who get up early to make kids ready ? ... LOL

I am talking to a Headhunter and he was being coy . Besides how much can you trust these people ? I did n't want to waste my time if I do n't get enough uplift to make a move worthwhile . Like most Expats , I will be coming to Qatar to save more money than I can back home . I am getting 80k here in the UK , with 15 % bonus and a long term tie-in that adds another 15 % to 25 % depending on how the company share price does . Of course Taxes in the UK are very high , as is cost of living . But I understand cost of living in Qatar is even higher -LRB- ? -RRB- .
Yes it is $ 10k   Month . First of all salaries are tax free here . Also things are cheaper as compared to UK . RASGAS providing excellent furnished villas to expats . Children education is also by the company and graduate   bonuses and leave salaries are also there . Overall best place to work in Qatar is Ras Gas   Qatar Gas .

Had a friend from Europe with same issue and he was just requested to carry both passport together -LRB- old one with visa and new one -RRB- . To make sure , check with your embassy , they should be able to guide you .
tnx dear friends
Yes you have to transfer your visa to the new passport .
just attached your new passport to the old passport and your visa remain valid ...
Hand over your new passport & old one to your personnel dept. cause , your old passport has been cancelled and you need to transfer the visa that is still valid into the new passport . Its a day 's work which your PRO can do . Dont complicate your journey with simple issues like these that can be sorted out when its right in front of you and a little bit of hard work .
Better get through agency
If you put an ad in the Gulf Times you will have more applicants than you can deal with . Pay is 1200-1600   month .
There are very manpower agencies here .
If you go to any Qatari house you can see many Nanny 's or on weekeds so many at Carrefore ??!!!
Yes , you have to go through sponsorship even if you hire locally . It 's illegal to have someone working for you that you do n't sponsor .
Its hearing aid . Google for hearing aid makers and try to find the local dealers . I think philips makes hearing aid . Check the pharmacies too .
No , you have to have cash or take out a bank loan . Mandi
Ive read -LRB- on other sutes -RRB- that some car sales outlets offer financing which is a bit more than the banks loan . Im in the same boat , comming over soon and need to acquire a vehicle ... stuff is cheap !!! going to get me a V8
Avoid bank loans well unless you wan na get stuck in a vicious circle of debt traps
u end up in debt traps if you financing luxury ... vehicle is not a luxury . ag never mind

To BaldRick It was clearly mentioned in our Religion that whenever there is a prayer we should leave our life ALL of it behind and rush for it as the prayer is considered to be a call from God . . as if God is inviting you to his home . . so every real muslim will go . . I 'm sorry for what happened to u . . but the islam does n't mean any offense to those who r not muslim . . it expect them to understand our religion and just make little adjust to ur life wherever u go ... When we go to another country we follow their rules . . not ours . . right ?? so know the rules & regulations within the country u live in and try to cope with it . . hope i make it clear without any offense to ANYBODY . .
do u need an English teacher or a teacer of English ?
Maderdor dont be sarcastic , you must first try to learn how to spell words correctly before trying to correct others !!

<p> its easy just bring your papers to the phil embassy including the paper from ched . < p> <p> lagyan lang nila ng stamp . you have to pay them per page . < p>
<p> same here , my educ cert was really required for the processing of the work visa . Got my cert attested by the Phil Embassy and after by MOFA here in Doha . But the P.E. can only accept it for attestation if its has red ribbon from DFA and the DFA authentication requires educational cert to be attested by CHED . Long process but it 's a must requirements . ;D Might it help to ask your company again whether its ok to do the attestation in Phil Embasssy and MOFA in Dubai ? or as what mentioned above , try to inquire P.E. in dubai . If so , would they need the orig copy ? because it 's kinda a risky to send it via courier unless you personally hand it over to your company . . ? Hope this helps . < p>
<p> be careful . . do not ever surrender the original red ribboned education certificate stamped by phil embassy & MOFA - qatar ... you are required to submit a copy only ... make sure you have also copied the stamps from phil embassy & MOFA-qatar ... the labor dept of qatar does not require the original ... you will only have to show them the original but they will not take it from you ... keep the original with you ... the red ribboned educ certificate has no expiration contrary to what other filipinos say ... remember it 's not that easy to get authenticated documents ... moreover , you will also need authenticated NBI clearance -LRB- red ribboned & stamped by phil embassy & MOFA-qatar -RRB- . . this time you can surrender the original as the NBI clearance itself is valid only for 1 year ... < p>
Hello mga kabayan . NEED YOUR HELP !!! I 'm currently working in KSA and got an offer to work in Doha , Qatar . After reading the above comments , I would just like to clarify things and hopefully find the answers to the ff questions : Note : I have already my educational documents -LRB- diploma TOR -RRB- attested by CHED and DFA with red ribbon . 1 . What would be the first step ? 2 . Should I get it attested here in Riyadh PE first ? 3 . Is it possible to go to Qatar in a non-resident working visa and once I arrived there , then I will start the process of attestation by the Qatar PE and MOFA-Qatar to upgrade my visa to resident visa ?
iam learning arabic letters from you tube , u also try to learn from you tube . Just i finished short vowels .
I 'm learning arabic in the centre culturel franais , it 's good because i 's small classes so you improve your level very fast I think ---------------------- Thus Spoke Zararootska
I recommend going to the Fanar cultural center . They have arabic course for only 300QR and a nice group of people . You will pick up some local culture too and in this part of the world , language & culture are very integrated so you get 2 for 1 .
Hey scribbler , Thanks for the info . Where about is that center ? and how do their levels work ? Or i guess send me their phone # and i will ask all the questions from them . I guess , its better that way . Thanks

Try at EMax store at various locations like al-asmakh mall .
try virgin megastore at villagio
You can buy Yamaha guitars at the Yamaha shop next tot eh Jarir book store on Salwa Rd. . Also there is a small Yamaha shop in the Virgin megastore at the Villagio Mall . They have a few very good value for money guitars in there Yamaha make exceptionally goof VFM guitars by way of quality for what you pay for them , though they are more expensive here than in the UAE for example . You can get a reasonable selection of Ibanez guitars at a reasonable music shop that I ca n't remember the name of just on the Al Mirqab roundabout at Al Muthaf St. Co-ordinates are : 25 17 ' 11.16 N 05132 ' 24 . Not a bad little shop , sells amps PA a few recording tools etc. . There are allegedly some more shops but I have not had time to find them yet . Hope this helps .
The other shop I mentioned but could not remember the name of is Badie Studio & Spares , Tel +974Â 442Â 3554 , +974Â 556Â 5052 , www.badiestudio.com , though the web site seems to be down at the moment .
In Jabir Bin Mohommed street after the Doha Sport Stadium , Cosmos harware store exactly on the round d about there is shop doing only the musical instruments . Close to Cornich and the Doha main Bus Station .
I was in Saudi before . Everything is there in Saudi about what you are looking for . Life is little difficult for bachelor over there . You can go for shoping alone by taxi . You can ride in a taxi . You can go alone by taxi but you must seat back side not beside the driver . If you wan na take any man with you then he must be your hubby son father   brother -LRB- not cousin -RRB- . Always you have to wear abhaya covering your head . Covering face is not mmendatory but ladies covering . As you are muslim , you will feel comfortable wherever you will go . Hotel , restaurant , bank every places there is seperate ladies section available . Weather is little dry then Doha . In weekend you can go to Makkah for Umrah .
I am currently working in Riyadh and going to move to Doha soon . I am also Egyptian with my family . the life style here is different ... but do n't worry , it will be better if you live in a compound . At least in Riyadh you can visit Mekkah and Madinah as much as you like . plus you have access to all GCC as in Qatar . I agree with all the above positive things about Riyadh . there is nice Club located in the Deplomatic Quarter with good facilities , it is far a little bit but still OK . few negative things but depends on how you can manage it : 1 . No enough schools in Riyadh with qualified staff . 2 . Traffic is nightmare .
You gave me a alittle light at the end of the tunnel ! thamks
I lived in Riyadh until just recently and I am a western women - you can walk alone , you do n't need your husband with u to go shopping - maybe years ago but not now . There are plenty of muslim women out without their husbands . You don ; t have to cover your head - unless u already do . Just make sure u carry a scarf as sometimes as women we do get asked to cover up - you will have to wear an abaya though . If u do go out with a man - he must be a relative . You do n't have to eat behind curtains in restaurants - that is your choice - but u must eat in the family section . I loved Riyadh and I wld go back tomorrow . Shopping is fabulous compared to Doha - 90 % off sales - amazing , and sooo much variety compared to here . Eating out is so cheap also and loads of variety to choose from . Hope this helps .
is it true that women are already allowed to drive in Saudi ?
do n't provide wrong information to someone if you do n't know please . Hazems Mom got scared after getting information from you ... . . lol
I am fine . What about you ?
I really appreciate all of your replies , specially Saeedkan and swine flu -LRB- you are too kind for that name !!! -RRB- Anyway >> we still have time to think it over ! I love Doha and I hate to leave it.Anyway , thanks a million !
I have heard of punishable restrictions over there.I mean they are very much strict about covering heads and not walking alone without a male member . Although I have heard that no defered quality goods are available over there.They have still low cost of living and good quality of life.But with restrictions ...
I really appreciate your opinions . I thought the same to myself , but I needed someone else to asure me . But what about sports for kids ?? I bring my sons to Aspire here , and I enjoy watching them . I guess no similar atmosphere would be available there in Riadh , right ???
Please dont dispose them and give it to me may be I can use your electronic items ... PM me if you are willing to ...
I have a washing machine that went wrong about three years ago . Apparently the part for it would have cost me just less then a new washing machine so I ended up buying a new machine . The old one has been sitting in my garden since then -- its very dusty as you can imagine !!! and I have no idea where to take it to dispose of it . If anyone knows where I can take it or if anyone wants it for its other parts and can transport it away themselves then let me know . Fraggle

Al Asmakh Street near Arab Roundabout have many stores with curtain accessories , sure you 'll find something there
Thanks for your response . Do you know where this is . I am not really familiar with the streets yet .
how are prices in sedar for curtains ? more expensive than any other furtniture store ?
So visited store and got s sample curtain ring home which was right size for the curtain rod . Placed order for metal rings with Sedar over phone and in color of my choice . The salesman told e delivery would be to my home in 5 business days and the curtain rings cost me QAR96 for a set of 16 rings in color of my choice . Not bad service though bit pricey . At least I have my curtain problem resolved ! Just FYI for anyone out there who finds themselves in similar situation - Sedar does address this request . Thanks Sedar !
Are you in Qatar ?
hi alison i advice to you to have a villa in any compaund because your baby will found more kids to play with them and spesialy there he will found a new frinds . thanks and regards
Doha has plenty of Play Groups . Live in a Villa , more kids to play with .
Yeah ! Agree with UkEngQatar . Doha has plenty of play groups ... they are called `` majlis ''
Well , as of our experience , Doha is the WORST place for Todds and kids . First of all , there are n't many playgrounds only couple but they are always so crowded and the kids are so agressive you do n't even want your kid to go near them , the kids here have no respect and no manner , beside it gets super HOT in summer so even forget about the parks . For sure its better to live in a Villa . I would not recommend living here unless you make some good money to save for your future .
Thanks guys . Also , any particular area   compound we should live in ?
Hi Alison , I have recently moved to Doha from the UK with a toddler in tow too . My son is going to be 2 in December so theyre roughly the same age . There are plenty of mother & toddler groups and nurseries to choose from . Eventually , youll make friends with little people and be able to socialise with them more often so the children can play together . Speaking from my own experience , my son is extremely happy here . He loves the good weather and he enjoys going swimming everyday too . The heat isnt really an issue , I think the air con is worse to be honest , I 'm always cold indoors ! I keep my son out of the midday sun and weve been ok so far -LRB- touch wood -RRB- . My hubby is home by 4pm ish everyday , so quality of family life is much better here than the UK . My hubby and son enjoy spending time together here , which wasnt so easily done in the UK . Im currently living in an apartment , because hubbys company has paid for it for 3 months , but were looking for a villa to move into . I agree with the others , a villa in a compound is probably the better option . Anyway , best of luck whatever you decide , feel free to ask any questions .
My advice is first try to convince the employer to process your visa as soon as possible . late sallary does not matter . Also inform the employer that you are illegal resident now and will be problem if any emergeny exit required . Also inform the employer with very soft words that if action not taken then you will be left with no option but to consult labor department .
I have seen these in loads of places , but I know for a fact they are in Jarir -LRB- or were recently -RRB- .
If i remember correctly the Apple store at the Mall had one of those . I remember coz the sales guy was trying to demonstrate it to me but didnt know how to get it to work ... yes thats right : P
Thank you all ... I checked in Jarir and PC One they do n't have ...
Ok there is a shop opposite ` Bench ' in Hayatt Plaza that sells gadgets and luggage . I do n't remember the name , but they had them as well .
And Smoke is corrcet ... I also had a salesman try and get me to buy one of these in the Apple Stores as well .

you can bring whatever you want , another questions is what you can wear on public and what you can not ? too short skirts or shorts are only home -LRB- knees should be covered on public -RRB- , as well as strap or strapless tops -LRB- shoulder should be covered on public -RRB- , transpiring fabrics , too tight and revealing blouses leave for the house private parties with yur close friends ... just use your common sense ... <i> <b> ********************* `` What lies behind us and what lies before us are small compared to what lies within us .

Blackberry is the best for playing bricks . Any challenger for my high scores ?
N97 IS THE BEST MOBILE IN MY OPINION
I HAVE 3 OF THEM EVEN THE HTC TOUCH . NOKIA N 97 PROBLEM WITH STUCK . BLACK BARRY BOLD WITH SCREEN PROBLEM I LIKE IPHONE MORE THEN OTHER , COZ OF GAMES AND CAN BE USE FOR INTERNT BROWSING AND EVEN FOR USING AS MP3 . Do n't Make Me Angry !
IPHONE IS GOOD . . BUT U CA N'T MAKE VIDOE CALL . .
Blackberry . Let 's say for instance , someone you knew had n't seen the new pictures of Megan Foxx . Luckily , you could just whip out your little Blackberry and show her Megan Foxx ' glory . You could easily take your internet addiction anywhere . ; -RRB-
Try HTC ... ... ... .
i will go for N97 . . all the above 3 are good phones but iphone and blackberry are usless in qatar ... iphone still not launched officialy cant get the 3g settings to work . blackberry avilable through qtel but expensive ... . most of them u see are unlocked ones which is only good to show off and cant be put to good use . Aana free , jaana free , Pakde gaye tho khana free .
I have tried them all ... BlackBerry is the best . . lots of services and features ... however , its kind of a business fon more than any other
iPhone N97 BB From the above N97 stands out because of its 5MP camera and HD Video recording . From the above phones anybody can send emails and access the Internet unless one wants to use the company . net.qa email from QTel which BB has . But I think Samsung omnia is the best out there as its GPS with Garmin software stands ahead . It also has 5MP camera combined with advantage of Windows . Check it out here : http:  www.gsmarena.com samsung_i900_omnia-2422.php
... no doubt . . its not mere cell phone ...
i have iPhone 3G . . with the 3G enabled . . working perfectly .
Why do you say that online degrees are worthless ?
Not for a professional position in education . Mandi
One has to go through a recognised university and not a ` virtual ' university ... ... Distance learning is the way forward for professionals who have to work as well as learn ... I have chosen a well know UK uni to do mine and it is recognised !!
Really Blosted ? Says who ?
Thanks Blosted . I did not know , now I do . But this mentality is wrong , do n't you think ?
@Palancole , Yeah I completely agree , I was even considering getting into a online university . But well , it 's still a big ol' fashion stone ages thinking here .
I was also considering completely online degree from an accredited uni . It is much more convenient than the traditional distance learn . Does anyone know an accredited , affordable university ?
geeldorn try a UK uni like Manchester Metropolitan . Google the list of top 50 unis in UK and go on their website and see if they do online degrees . But like Blosted said , the mentality in the Middle East plays against Online degree . So just ensure it will be accepted .

Just connect your D-Link router using a straight cable from one of its LAN port to your PC Laptop . Just type 192.168.1.1 in ur address bar , asks for username password . Default may be admin admin . Plz Check .
thanks , but how to connect the dlink router in laptop ? i tried before to use cable wire i connect it to laptop and to the router of dlink but still i can not log into this ip add .
Hope you have to configure your LAN Adapter IP Address . . Can u Just tell your D-Link Router Model .
my dlink model is D-Link AirPlus Xtreme G DWL-2100AP Wireless Access Point .
Plz set ur PC Ip to dhcp.Ping 192.168.0.1 ... if u get reply then hit 192.168.0.1 in address bar . . Username - admin,password-admin   none
do i need still to connect the cable wire in the router or no need ? can i do it direct here in my pc without using cable wire ? or i will do what you said from the start ? Thanks ...
If u need to configure you have to connect with Straight cable to pc Lap . Else if d-link is connected with your network type 192.168.0.1 in address bar.Else the 1 st one is the only way to do ...
i am connected both but this qtel is located on the ground floor so the signal is not good enough . we put extra router on the second floor .
It means you are connecting to qtel router using Wi-Fi and not LAN cable . Am I correct ? to setup dlink WAP , you have to connect your laptop to dlink WAP using a LAN cable as azarajez said . But you have to check you router IP addy first , because usually WAP are automatically obtaining IP addy from router -LRB- default -RRB- so , the IP addy of dlink WAP changes .
So here it is . . Ur using dlink usb dwa 125 rite.This is not a Router , an wireless Adapter to be used within LAP DESK to connect to wireless Networks . The thing u have to use is Wifi Repeater Bridge to extend wireless signals from ground Floor to 1st Floor . . Hope you got the answer ...
I am connected using the dlink adapter
The thing you have to do to secure your WI-FI is to connect to q-tel router ans set password Maybe WEP WPA WPA2 . Hope WPA2 is more Secure . .
Please download the manual to configure the ap ... http:  www.mediafire.com ?x66nr17n73nhvds

On Salwa road are several mattress shops , like silent night , King Koil etc. . The cheap ones are available at souq haraj . Aisha-Taweela
I 'll also be looking for a good mattress soon . Are the one 's on Salwa road good quality ? Do they have good back supporting mattresses that arent rock hard either , and do they sell box springs ? For now me and my husband are sleeping on those cheap ones from the souq I think , they are rock hard and not very comfy at all .

UAE license , so far is valid ... in future now guarantee ...
pay to traffic police an amount of 200 to get valid qatari driving license , not a big deal to get license here now when you have already uae 's one !!!
You can arrange to get a temporary driving licence @ first after showing your uae driving licence at the traffic dept. . You will have to open a file with them ... do your eye test and then you can renew it as long as your business visit visa is valid . Every renewal will cost you around QR .150   - After you have your work permit stamped you can convert it to a permanent driving licence .
including allowance and offer in HUAWEI telecom and is it advisible to qatar for 12k
i guess so.uae licence is valid here .
I wonder why some countries have a few different traffic rules than the international ones . I just finished a <aÂ rel=followÂ href=http:  www.hdstruckdrivinginstitute.com> truck driving school Tucson < a> and in my first international route I got a ticket for something that is legal in my country .

go for Plasma ...
LCD , new technology . plasma has a limited life of use .
<b> present day LCD technology has come to so advance !!! Now LCD comes with more then 50000 1 dynamic ratio also panel comes with 100 Hz Technology . Now LCD is way head of plazma . The link given in earlier answer is 2 years old !!! So it is LCD is better thats why SONY , SAMSUNG and other company makes Few Plazma TV compared to LCD . Also a result of the success of LCDs , the number of plasma manufactures has decreased over the past two years . LCD is WAY AHEAD go for LCD or LED !! So while no technology can be successful forever , plasma has at the very least a few years left , it wo n't be LCD that will kill it . The only technology that actually seems poised to replace it is OLED !! GO FOR LCD <B>
Go for LCD , it is better than plasma and lasts longer .
LCD is a new tech ... and more expensive so it s better

I thought you want to sell your dickies , that is defintley illegal ... .
`` sigh '' ... it is so true that humor does not travel well , sometimes I confuse well written English with the ability to understand English humor . Sorry Mr Dickies .
Have you asked the one who assessed you about your driving skills and where have you failed ? Because by asking , you might improve and eradicate those mistakes the next time you would go for a license . When driving always see to it that your eyes are looking on the road and must not look on the shifting gear when you change shift . Because a split second can endanger someone 's life or your life . Slow moving vehicles must always use the right lane . When going for an intersection maybe let other cars pass before you continue . I forgot the right of way on whether you should go or stop . I think it 's better for the latter so that you can have a safe trip . Also maintain a considerable distance if there 's a car in front of you . The distance would be the same as if you would imagine that there 's an equal size car in between the two of you . Just in case the front car would go and hit his breaks , you would have the ability not to hit the front car with the distance you just imposed . Hope you would pass next time and kindly tell the one sitting beside you on your next test to tell your mistakes after the result has been given .

Hi leaders23 Impressive to read that you have done this journey twice , would it be possible for you to share your experience -LRB- short trip report -RRB- with us ? Thanks MandM
I read this thread while researching the Triptic requirements for my drive from Doha to London . Now that I am back in London I think I can dispel some of the myths . I drove from Doha through Saudi , Jordan , Syria , Turkey , Greece , Italy , Germany and Holland before taking a ferry to the UK . The car had a Qatari number plate . Saudi first , You do not need a Triptic , just a visa -LRB- Transit in my case -RRB- which is usually valid for 3 days . There is nowhere to buy a Triptic anywhere near the Jordan border . Jordan , There is no need for a Triptic or advance visa . This can be bought at the border along with car insurance . Syria , There is no need for a Triptic . I had a visa from the Syrian Embassy in Doha . Insurance can be bought at the border . Turkey , There is no need for a Triptic . Visa can be bought at the border along with car insurance . Greece , no Triptic requirement , Insurance can be bought at the border and covers the whole EU for one month . Having entered the EU , there are no further visa , insurance or Triptic requirements . Egypt has a Triptic requirement but is a nightmare to drive in . I would recommend leaving the car in Aqaba and taking the ferry to Nuweiba , where coaches operate to Cairo .
thanks but i think i will not go to Jordan to go to Egypt I think from Saudi to Red Sea To Egypt -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- I Think -RRB- -RRB- !!! Does Any one know If it is the same like Jordan in Egypt -LRB- Safage -RRB-
You must have a tripticket , which is required by the Egyptian law . You also must have a passing visa through saudi arabia . And great amount of coffee to alert you while driving ; and great patient on the borders . Have a safe trip
thanks Whatever-7 and Mohammed 1000 But Can i get this tripticket from the borders in Egypt or it is a must to get from Qatar ??? If it was from Egyption borders then what is requisted for it ????
Hi , look if you want to go to egypt by car you need to do triptek from here since your car has a qatari plate number . I went to lebanon twice , first I went without a triptek but it was a lot of headache especially at Syria borders , since I needed to pay twice on the borders . One when I entered and pass to lebanon and another time when I left lebanon coming back to Qatar through syria borders . I advise you to do a triptek but you need a qatari guy to sponsor you ... Enjoy your trip : -RRB-
Hi Friend Hope u will have a safe trip to Egypt . Yes , u need to get a trip ticket book from Qatar riving club in c ring road with a Qatari sponsorship . For ur car is still under installment , no problem to leave Qatar but do n't ask the bank to give u a letter to leave Qatar with ur car . Also , u must have a valid Qatari license and u must make car insurance in the Saudi border and it will cost u 75 00 Saudi riyals per trip . u have two ways to reach Egypt . 1a - thru Deba to hurghada by a high speed fairy boat and the trip will last for 4 hours approx . 1b - Thru Deba to Safaga and it will take about 12hours and I dont prefer it . 2 - Thru Jordan from Al Aqaba to Sharm el Sheikh and the trip will take about 6 Hours by sea . I hope that the above information is useful to u and it will help u to take the right direction .
So i cant get triptic from egyption border ???? This is too sad coz i dont know any Qatari man over here !!! But is it the only way ??????
I am planning for a road trip to egypt next week , how did you find it , or you did n't go ? I want to know the schedule and prices of the ferry between Saudi arabia and Egypt . Also where is this driving club in c ring road ?
hi there just join this group although not living in Qatar . Anyway saw this post as i am also keen to drive to Egypt from Saudia . I am looking for same info so thought join you guys to keep all interested posted , my trip is not due until December . I do have little bit of extra news that might be useful : Got the ferry schedule below : Sunday , Wednesday , Friday from Duba-Hurghada at 17.30 pm Sunday , Wednesday , Friday from Hurghada-Duba at 03.00 am I will keep you posted if and when i get further info . cheers

If you are coming from Jaidah flyover on Musheirb street on your right you will see food Palace and next will be Home Centre . Turn left drive straight at the end you will see Sara Restaurant .
Sorry after Food Palace turn RIGHT
Thanks , clear with Sara restuarant but need clear location of Shabbir ka Hotel Dhaaba ? Thanks once again
if you 're coming from the Home centre -LRB- on your left -RRB- do n't go on the Jaida flyover , go straight towards ` the Centre ' on side road & before the end of the flyover , turn right to the freeq Bin Mahmood ... go straight ... pass traffic signals ... now from the 2nd T signals , turn left ... then first turn to right get into a narrow street ... after some 100 meters the hotel is on your left ... Its a small Dhaba type place & the name is Jamaal al Jamaal restaurant . hope its understandable ...

Aptech is a fine choice for introductory photoshop lessons .
If you have NEVER worked on Photoshop before , the best would be to first get ur hands dirty with online tutorials and get yourself familiar with the menu 's and just the basic working of the software . Youtube is the best source . Problem with going for short courses is that they just skim through everything quickly giving u an introduction , showing you what the menus do and other such options nothing useful . . all of which you can learn online for free . Once you feel you are good with the basics just enroll yourself for more advanced course where you will fully unleash the power of Photoshop ... thats just my opinion for value for money . : P
Aptech ... i think they r the best
Souq Faleh is the abaya souq . It is on the same road as Souq Jaber , it is closer to the western union . There are about 100 shops in there or more , and you can get readymade or pick a design and they will sticth it for you . You can get a modest abaya for around QR 150 and a more elaborate stich for around 300-400 . Abayas in this souq can go for thousands but it depends on how elaborate you want it . Bargain the price , be relentless , if you dont suceed in one shop go to the next . _____________________________________________________ `` Diplomacy is the art of saying ` Nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers ''
Souq Al.Deera is right next to souq Aljaber . . You 'll love love love their Abayas . . they 're cheap and they get them made for you in no time . . I just got 4 Abays last week . -LSB- img_assist | nid = 7232 | title = Dua | desc = Amen :--RRB- | link = none | align = left | width = 440 | height = 56 -RSB-
Hi the cheapest place to buy a abaya is in souq wagaf
I only paid 100qr for one that I bought in souq Waqif .
It is available all over the Doha . You have to try in good supermarket , and fruit and vegetables market .
try in Family Food Center along airport road ...
Try also , Luluhyphermarket -LRB- Matar Qadeem and Gharafa -RRB-
This may be a stupid question , but I would like to know , how do we distinguish organic and inorganic fruits and vegetables .
Every where . .

If you would like to visit a see line ocean it amazing try to go over there .
Well , it depends upon your budget . You could try Asian -LRB- located opposite airport , besides Pizza Hut -RRB- . They have a big hall that can certainly allocate 30 people easily . Or else , try Osra -LRB- Mannai-roundabout -RRB- , they too have a hall you can throw a party . If ur budget is big , then i think u can rent out Taj Resoi at Marriot .
Money is not an issue . . I need a grand one ... where we can conduct some games & all . . Taj Rasoi . . Can it accomodate 30 ppl ???
If money is not an issue then try Alishan , Hediard and Bateel . There is a great Lebanese restaurant in the Pearl -LRB- Burj Al Hamam -RRB- but very expensive . You should also try the Sanjiv Kapoor 's restaurant in Souq Waqif .
Gud answer cherukkan . . Alishan is really pricey . . IF he does n't have ne pblm , it would be gud for him to throw a party . . For rest , i ca n't give much opinion ...
It is for real
Yest is true . We normally have to apply a week in advance for an exit visa . BTW they are not allowed to refuse you an exit visa -LRB- supposedly ! -RRB-
for everything you need sponsor letter approval ... ups you can go to the WC without asking . . or to make sure you dont run away from your job or bank loans . Sponsor has to put up the fees for visa ticket and they want guarantee you stay for the contract period .
you can have your sponsor issue a yearly exit permit but you may have to pay for it -LRB- few hundreds QR -RRB-
well in Bahrain and UAE they re lucky to live without it , its disappointing coz i was considering Qatar as the next destination , m not sure anymore
if you are lucky your company may grant you a multi exit visa , it lasts for 12 months and costs 100QR
no reven , it cost 500QR . i have it .
YES !!!! If you are under-sponsorship of your company . For husband sponsor - no need for exit permit .
Every corner of the street there is Beauty Saloons . Unless you start your business with a big group associated or in a 5 star hotel , success of the business is very doubt . Most of the parlors are managed by wife as just a time pass or to keep occupied . Think twice
think thrice about investing your hard earn money ... if you are settled in your home country . . just stay there and what for to get hammer to bang your head ...
No , of course not ! you can not get the license in one day ! if that actually happens for you , then it 's completely unfair to the rest of us who worked hard and long to get a license ! you need patience ...
Even in Lulu Hypermarket there is Eye Testing . . Unit in the Optical Shop .
Most of the optical shops are authorized for eye test , and when you join a driving school they will arrange learners licence same day . But if you are going for direct test , it is not so easy .
thank you so much . .

Hi Just to clear my question , my visa stamped on 4months before as secretary -LRB- I am an engineer -RRB- when i asked my PRO to change profession , he says , it 's possible to do only completion of one year . . Is IT true ?
Hi , Changing your category of work can be done provided you are receiving not less than 7,250 QR and you have to certify thru bank salary transfer for the last three months of your salary . At the same time your sponsor must allow you to change your status . At any given time you can apply for this . Not to mention you have to proved your education attainment like diploma certificate and transcript certified by your embassy . Hope i help you with this , good luck and be well
my question , are u doing an engineer job , if not how u expect ur sponsor to change ur profession ? my second question , why people agree to come on such visa if their level is higher than that .
Mr.Salah I am doing my engineering design jobs from last few months with present company and earning good salary too . Previously , my company offered a job and sent to me employment visa and at that time i couldnot realize waht is mentiond in the visa . anyways i thankfull you all for your valuable advices . . If anuthing more please drop down for me ...
I changed the profession on my RP after less than 2 months . So it definitely is doable . Of course it may depend on who you work for and how vigorous they are in pursuing it . Cheers SK

Use Geyser water .
Bucket & cup set !
Buy common sense ...
keep the water in the bucket in that bathroom for the evening . after taking bath in the evening then keep water in that bucket for the morning . make this as a habit then you will get cold water at both time lol ...
If you have a water heater : turn off water heater -LRB- boiler -RRB- in your bathroom or kitchen . This water will remain room temperature . So , use cold water -LRB- blue part of tap -RRB- as hot water and red one as cold water -LRB- oposite to what you do in winter -RRB- when water heater is on .
there are water tank coolers available near najma which work like a refrigerator for your tank when connected ... but they are expensive around 3000 to 4000Qr plus additional for installation

Generally , it 's not the done thing . My husband , a carefree sort , wears knee-length shorts to the mall . But my teenage son got accosted my a couple of non-Gulf Arabs when he wore shorts to the mall - so trousers for him .
Yes , you can wear shorts , just not really short indecent shorts . They should be to the knee and shoulders need to be covered ie no singlet tops for either men or women however many ex-pats do flout this .
It really depends WHERE in public you go . On your compound or to your kids school is perfectly fine . I see shorts in all the malls . But really , it is considered offensive in this culture , and while you wo n't get arrested , you will get stared at .
All the answers above are correct ; Qatar is less conservative than KSA but not nearly as open as UAE or Bahrain . It 's a great place in the middle . As a man wear your `` boy pants '' you 'll be fine ; as a woman same , but more importantly keep the shoulders covered . You 'll be comfortable and wo n't get a second look . Coming from Houston , welcome to the nearest corollary weather-wise ... !
just do n't wear short shorts , we do n't want to see the little guy pop out .
Wear anything Qatar is not conservative and mad like KSA .

Yup you can come back on visit visa even if you have ban
What kind of visit visa ? As per Qatar Law if your RP is cancelled , you need to wait at least 2 years before you come back here in Qatar .
try to comeback after 6 months !
You can not enter again here . Except for family visit visa
??? sorry to say ... i heard its NO But you can come on work visa from another country .

HI . My husband works for Hamad . We are living in a beautiful villa in a compound full of HMC staff . What is great is that all the husbands , and a couple of wives , work in the same department so they are all generally good friends . The facilities in our comound are limited -LRB- pool and gym only -RRB- however the social life makes up for it . What i do however , suggest is getting out and meeting other people when you arrive so that you have variety to your day . Contact me if you like . I have a 2 year old son who is always keen for play dates . Best regards , P1x13

They donot Provide Accomodation in Compound for Couples . nly for pplz who are single here but if he bring you here then he will get Housing Allownce worth 5000QR if he is just a Nurse but if he is a DOC then more and he can find house anywhere he want . . Dont worry Depends on HIM he Choose a Compound or he request for CASH . better to GET CASH coz house for 2 to 3 Rooms are just 4000QR Good Class home . if you want XELENT HOUSE then just Start Adding money . .
Yes I have of course checked the HMC website - it is a little dry , I was hoping for some personal perspective . Thank you for your comment Kashoo . In his discussions with his new boss-to-be my husband has been told that he will have a villa in the compound -LSB- so I hope there is room for me ! :--RRB- -RSB-
Some years ago many HMC senior staff were housed in two-story detached villas in Al Messila compound on the Rayyan Road . Some do still live there but I do n't know whether villas are still allocated to new staff . The houses are good and , like most compounds here , the recreational facilities provided are quite good -LRB- social centre , swimming pool , tennis courts , etc -RRB- . I am sure that you will be able to live comfortably here . However , if you have pets , make sure that the compound will permit them , some do not .
Bernadette . , ya wel come . i know all about HMC coz my friends are working there and when i was posting reply for u she was with me so i asked here and i posted for you . . dont worry . . BTW why room for u alone ? arnt u r the Wife ?? : D

Hmm ... Why do I sense it is not a `` relaxing massage '' you are looking for at this hour ?
Im not a mum , but as far as QR procedures go , I know ... upto the end of the 32nd week you will need a qualified docs certificate . 33rd upto the end of 35th week you will need qualified docs certificate and this will need to be approved by the QR doc . From the beginning of the 36th week you will not be allowed to travel on QR .
please request in a front passenger seat if you are book to economy if you are in business class then much better as you can relax well . take care : -RRB-
Oh and all what I said is for pregnancy without complications , i.e. normal   single .
I am not sure about this , but I think that QA will let you board only of you can show a med certificate stating that you are not more than 28 weeks pregnant .
You will need a medical certificate for this . Make sure it is either from Hamad or a registered practitioner like El Emadi or Ahli . And if they ask you at the boarding counter if you are tired , say no - you are in very well . . they are very strict on this
If your company is ready to give you NOC why you want to leave the country ??!!
You can request for wheel chair or even the high lift , if you want.While flying , drink a lot of water . Keep moving . Eat frequent and small meal portions.Put belt under your tummy.You can change over to a row of three empty seats and can even take a nap , if you want.Safe journey ! Safe delivery !
I apologize for wrong entry this was a answer to another quetion regarding NOC and at the time my computer get stucked and opened answer page to this question and after I post only I noticed , the disadvantage of this site is once you post you cant delete or modify .

Good salary for a street sweeper . Not too good for a nuclear scientist . What do you do !!?!?!?!
Whats your job?experience?You should always negotiate for free accomodation or accomodation allowance and free transport home-office & vice versa or transpo allowance .
2000QR net . the 200 is for the food . . all free transpo etc. will work as a receptionist on a exclusive school for girls .
if u convert that to Philippine peso that would only be around 23,000 . will u be happy with that ? QR200 for food for a month ?? NO ! not unless u eat arabic bread everyday , or u will indulge yourself into forced diet . if you have a good experience try bargaining for MORE . ; p
what ? just a street sweeper ... ? the job is a receptionist on a exclusive school for girls .
thank you for that info . . they say it will range to 28-20k PHP ... I dont know how and what is the cost of living there , i 'm not into dieting . . so I guess 200 is not enough . .
If you are well experienced so very BAD ask for Another 1K . You have to Bargain ????? Then leave it . IF you need more experienced the take it ???? It is an easy Job ...
job is receptionist on a exlusive school for girls . I have a lot of experiences.Presently , I work in Engineering firm as a technical support representative . . I used be a call center agent .
exchange nowadays is too low .
you got a point . . thank you . I should ask for more . . because I got an experience ... Thanks .
I 'll tell you what really sucks , that they want you to pay a `` processing fee '' on top of a really low salary . One month 's worth of pay ??? Mandi
What PESO ????????? Pakistan Peso ???? What Currency is this ?????
lol QR 200 for food equates to 1 Roti or Kabooz -LRB- arabic bread -RRB- for breakfast , lunch & dinner for 2 per month . . ! Did your employer actually tell you that QR 200 was your food allowance ?
right . . but still the offer is slow ... i will demand for a raise . . we are talking about the Riyals ... sorry to confused you
yeah exactly ... and not only that there 's a added fees i dont know why ...
Sorry , Philippine Peso ... the processing fee really sucks ...
If Your visa in Doha is visit , i suggest to take that offer because you will be run out of time ... If not why don `` t try to other Company . . just pass your Resume or CV , sure somebody will call you for Interview ... Good Luck ... ...
everything has equivalent amount , better ask . by the way the 200 i mentioned is good for 10days because I ` am cooking my food at night and sometimes eat at fastfood for lunch.Expect more ... Direct hiring happens only local , meaning when u are here in qatar only . If from Phil all are thru agency . At the end your contract in Phil will be lessen when u arrived here . Let say 200-500 riyal less .
You have to spend minimum 500 QAR   month for food
No , I am in my country right now ... Philippines . I got an agency here which links to Cambridge . . So the offer i said is according to the manpower agency here ... if there are ways on how to apply directly , then I should try and go for it .
Cambridge International - for QR2 ,200 to QR2 ,500 ? so bad !
talaga ! i bet your Pinay so I hope its okay if we speak on our language ... ideal salary for you ?
It does n't sound like an exclusive school at all - that salary is far too low . Shame on them ! Triple would be more like it .
Kabayan . . syado mababa offer ... ask for more ... cost of living here is very high ... take the advice of others ... it will help ...
yeah right ! thanks for the info . . i 'm not that desperate for that job ... thanks really for your advice .
Now I can decide :-RRB- thanks !
Hi all , My concerning question is about if you get the job offered 2,500 QR net per month . The company will cover you the visa fee , the return ticket fee , meals , transportation and accommodation . Is it still a low salary ? Thank you in advance
Thank you for your information -LRB- It included medical -RRB- I have no idea ` bout living in Doha , it made me confused a bit . If it is hotel industry , is that an acceptable salary ? Or just compare like street sweeper ;-RRB-
Miss Havu because of the number of people looking for a job here in Doha have increased , chances are that Salary Packages are being offered low since they know that most applicants come here using Tourist Business Visa . Hope you found a suitable job already =-RRB-
Best of luck for your New Adventure ...
havu , if you can still negotiate on a higher offer , not with the agency but with the company directly , . if they have included their contact number on the offer letter they sent , you can call them or email them directly. ,
Well , actually I signed on offer of employment and all documents , I supposed to know this forum in advance :-RRB- anyway . Thank you bassbogs
Do n't commit suicide by joining Cambridge ... They were a hell hole when I had my kids admitted there . I hear they still are . Accommodation ? What kind ? A small box to sleep . Do n't get too excited . This salary is way too low . QR3000 - QR3 ,500 seems all right . We pay our worker -LRB- unskilled manual worker -RRB- almost twice your offer including accommodation , transportation and medical . No deduction for processing their visa or whatever . Just be careful before you accept . Good luck .
So is there any chance to discuss about the salary if I signed already the offer of employment ? and they are doing the residency visa for me now ?
My experience is Dr. Jameel , at Al rafa clinic -LRB- Now renamed as Aster Clinic -RRB- Mushairib branch -LRB- Opp . Home Center -RRB- is a very good Skin specialist .
yes yes . . dr jameel is one of the best
Never ever take ladies to Mr Jameel I syed@Aster . Overall the clininc is good though . I visited yesterday , and had very bad experience . I do not have any other good reference that I can guide you but please stop thinking to take your woman to him . He is big A & ** . .

I hope this dog has a family looking for him . Sadly in Dukhan we had had 2 retreivers dumped last week , they are very friendly and socialised and obviously used to belong to someone . This is exactly why I get sad by the changing fashions of dog breeds here , this time last year everyone wanted a Golden Retriever . Good luck , I hope you find his owners or a nice home for him .
Jasmine - that is so sad to hear . Why do people do this ? You are giving your dog a death sentence of slowing starving and dying in a cruel way . These dogs do not know how to fend for themselves ... The dog I found is about 10 years old and has been part of a family . How cold hearted must you be to just dump him and leave . I can not keep him for much longer as I have 4 cats who are so stressed out and living in my bedroom - it ; s not fair on them . I will keep him until after New Year incase his family has gone on vacation and the maid does not know where to look . After that he will need to be re-homed . Not sure how to go about it but have already spoken to Kelly at QAWS . She is a star ...
I have sent you a pm
Golden Retreaver is very decent and affectionate well behaved dogs , please treat it well , i had a Golden Retreaver , it lived for 18years , it was one among my family members.Please send me a PM if no one claims
Thanks guys . Just gave him a bath as he was dirty and smelly from the rain . Yes , will phone the vets in the morning as I am sure his owner is looking for him . I really hope he find his family as he is such a lovley and well behaved dog . Will also put up some flyers at the usual places .
LX so far the only shop where I have seen wetsuits is Go in Villagio Mall , but in the area nearby the Museum of Islamic Art there are two or three stores you might want to check because they sell marine stuff goods . Also going to Al Wakra there is one store for marine items . When going to AW from Doha , passing the first R A on your right hand side there is a store for marine items . Do you know where the Lufthansa offices are -LRB- Rayyan Complex -RRB- there you can find another store that sells maritime stuff . Hope to be helpful !! Regards !!

No need Exit permit if your family is under your sponsership only check the validity of their resident permit
Your husband is the Qp staff so Qp is his sponcer as his family you have the family visa under hs -LRB- ur Husband -RRB- sponcership.you are free to find job & work here , free to travel home anytime as you dont need any exit permit all this as long as your husband is working in Qp.Once he decide to leaves his job or country your sponcership automatically stands cancelled & you will have to leave the country as well
you are under sponsor of your husband ... your husband is under sponsor of qp company ... if the company will cancel the visa of your husband automatic ur visa will be cancel as well as ur son
First time visa processing is normally done by the employer -LRB- in this case your husband 's sponsor -RRB- . However your husband is your sponsor .
I agree with above members . You are better off buying a car than renting and just sell it when you are ready to leave Qatar even at a loss you are still saving a bunch and protecting yourself from those '' special terms and conditions '' .
if aint wrong...15-17 .000 QR year . with this amount you can buy tomorrow one Aveo model 2003-2006 . after 1 year , you can sell it with 10-12000 QR ! Be smart !
drac is correct !
the rent a car monthly may cost between 1500 -2000 depending on the condition of the car , and if it is fully insured or third party , there are several car rent company , all are same , but you need to check all the terms and condition before renting one and special terms that are related to car accident
LOL !! You guys HAVE to stop renting cars for such long periods . Almost all the instructors in my college had rented cars , some for even 2 years ... really really dumb . Even if you dont know the whereabouts in a new country you ARE already posting a question in a website where you can sell your cars . Even if your considerng the lose you 'll be facing when selling your car , its still going to be better then just paying the full amount of the car & then just walking away . You 'll ATLEAST get half of the price back .
still if you want to rent . try calling euro dollar . they can give you affordable rent per year plus good service as well . number is 4351397 . goodluck !
I have not heard such roumer ? as for Computer check for the car : Most of the places are on Salwa road , one very known one is the German computer check up ... is it the best ... can not realy say
hi may be wrong news . in UAE it is 15 years .
The best place is the german engine check on Salwa Road . It is 200qr well spent .
unheard of !!! absolutely absurd !!!
I think you should complete minimum one year with your first Sponsor for transferring your visa to another Sponsor .
I see no problem if your current employer issues NOC , lucky you , they do n't usually gives NOC here .
thanks a lot , ... I got the same view that of Prudence4730 's . I ca n't find anything in the labor law that states I need to complete a year of service with my current employer before changing sponsorship . But the glitch is , the PRO of my supposed to be new company said that I need to complete the one year service . Can you please help me shed a light on this ?
The PRO is right .
Takes one year to change

Karwa is n't great either though but it 's ok . . `` Live with passion , Die with style ''
To be fair , karwa is not as bad as people make them out to be , it is run very professionally ... but my personal preference is fox limousines though ... price wise same as karwa , why i prefer them is that its easier to book them than karwa . J.J

Our company is giving off the next working day which is sunday dec 20th . Regards !!
yes we have day off . . on friday whole day
We work 6 days a week -LRB- Saturday thru Thursday -RRB- therefor our Management give us the Saturday of .
For private construction companies . . no addl . leave . . but for govt . & semi govt . u will get . .
yes we do have off on sunday ...
i wish we could get 1 day holiday either thursday or sunday ... i hope its sunday :D that is for government and or semi-government . but for private companies who have work on friday ... and working in retails ... i doubt if they will give you off-day , they will just consider it overtime for you , or add it to your annual vacation leave .
The labour law clearly says Eid and Qatar National Day should be working day , so if the holiday falls on Friday this day should carry forward to next working day , if your company working on Saturday it should be Saturday , if Friday-Saturday off should be Sunday , unfortunately some companies are not following any rules which gets any benifits to employees , you work . . work ... work ... we earn when we feel you dont need simply go . . when you find any good job with better salary can say `` No release '' . sponsorship law should be revised or you dont have any right as a human being , your life is controlled by a company or a sponsor ??!! No freedom of movement .
INSHALLAH .
Here 's the official website for National Day . http:  www.ndqatar.com english  There are n't yet any events listed , so be sure to check back as 18th Dec. approaches .
Our company is giving us an off-day on Thursday -LRB- 17th Dec ,09 -RRB- and I have heard that several other companies will do the same .
Here 's the official website for National Day . http:  www.ndqatar.com english  There are n't yet any events listed , so be sure to check back as 18th Dec. approaches .
Stay put in your room , get fat and sleep . Work on 1st January . Just get use to it bro . ; -RRB-
dont u think its too late to celebrate it ... lol !
Yeah , it 's late to celebrate it but it 's worth celebrating it with people important to you than celebrate on time alone.Right ? Cheers !
But Dubai had a spectacular fireworks display earlier ... as in amazing :-RRB-
My zoom does n't reach as far as Dubai ! ;--RRB- xxx
In my case , I intend to experience Scotland 's HOGMANY next year as a plain housewife : -RRB-
and a working New Year for the rest of us :P
Did you not notice that Qatar kept the lighting for the Nationals Day until now . So I guess even though officially Qatar is not celebrating New Year Arrival by quietly they are acknowledging it : -RRB-
watched the fireworks last night in Dubai on tv ... it was amazing !!!!!! :-RRB- -LRB- it was pretty boring here in Qatar like a normal day , hmmm -RRB-
All kinds of studies would help u to get the job in doha . . its actually u who has to decide which field u wan na choose . .
are you a Qatari national ? how old are you ? The best advice that one can give you is to fisrtly - think about what it really is that you want to do in life . What are you good at ? If you are unsure ... sometimes it helps to see a careers advisor . They are tests that you can take , which identify your strengths and weaknesses , and that can ultimately help you pursuing a career in line with your unique talent . If you do n't have anyone you can talk to , e-mail me more details about yourself , and maybe I can direct you a little ;o-RRB- bebeuk@gmail.com
as bea said , do what you are good at . . not even what you would love to do , but what you are able to do ... If i want to be a singer , but do n't have a good voice , my only desire without the talent is not gon na help me ... If I want to be a Finance manager , but I could barely pass the Math exam in the school , my only desire without the talent is not gon na help me . . If I want to be a basketball player , but i am 1m60cm , my only desire without being gifted is not gon na help me ... Chose whatever you like out of WHAT YOU ARE GOOD AT ...
Do you want to continue studies further or want to join some short diploma   certificate courses ? I have suggested you earlier , go for some ticketing & computer courses in the Q A section , as it 's in demand . But register your self as a private candidate for further studies as well . Get at least a Bachelor 's degree ... it 's my advice :-RRB-

Yes . it will count towards your luggage allowance so you may not be able to take much else unless you pay excess baggage !
Inquire airline before departure about the size and weight of box . Keep the bill handy for custom clearence .
Allowed for up to 32 inch . Above the limits can be done through cargo
Hi , you can take 42 '' LCD TV , but its total weight with box must be less than 32kg and size as per airport rules and price should be less than 25000 IRS , so that you will not pay customs.If the TV is bought recently than its possible because all new , and latest models are slim and weighing less , I took one to India recently in month of July . bye
yes you can ... just ensure it is carfefully packed though and allow time at check in
good for you matet ...

Try Millenium airport hotel , it is 5 minutes from the airport and 500 meters from GIGICO metro station . I paid around 400 Ryials per night for a double room through Expedia.com The hotel is 4 stars with nice and spacious rooms and good service . And one piece of advice , use the metro , it is cheap , reliable and will take you to all interest points including Emirates mall and Mall of Dubai . Have a nice trip and let me know if you need other info
That would be a 2-3 star hotel . MOE -LRB- Mall of Emirates -RRB- is accessible if you 're going by Dubai Metro . I would suggest that you stay near Deira City -LRB- rather than on that area if you plan to stroll around -RRB- . You 'll have more access to malls like Deira City Center , Dubai Mall -LRB- near tall Burj Khalifa and the awesome water fountain -RRB- and Creek Park -LRB- Dolphinarium etc. . . -RRB- and not really far from the airport ... Suggestions that would fit your budget -LRB- That I know -RRB- : Deira City Center Hotel , City Seasons Hotel , Ibis Deira City Center , Novotel Hotel .
Thank you very much for your suggestion . Any other recommend area beside Deira ? Can I drive in Dubai with Qatar Driving License ?

Err , I 'd be a little taken aback if a man came up to me in a Doha Starbucks and started a random chat and I 'm a Westerner ! You need to go a little easy on that kind of thing here . Mandi
What mandi said ^ ^ Go on google wiki and read up on middle eastern culture , or you going to get yourself into trouble . If I was you i 'd try to get involved with one of the local groups or go along to one of the bars . Groups like the hash house harriers are often a way to meet new people , talk to baldrick on here .
lots of places to hang around here were you could randomly sit down and have a chat ... .

A lot of guys used to go to the one at Ramada signal to meet other guys ... Now they go to the Beanery . Besides , Starbucks is so 2006 . No one goes anymore .
Yeah Ryan , get yourself on the good ole HHH , we 'll soon sort you out . Doha is to Dubai what Amish country is to Texas . If you are looking for sex on the beach then Dubai is for you -LRB- till you get nicked -RRB- , but in small town Doha , strange things get noticed very quickly . <aÂ href=http:  www.flickr.com photos b_2_d 3262305312 Â title=MonotoneÂ MIAÂ byÂ baldrick2dogs,Â onÂ Flickr> <imgÂ src=http:  farm4.static.flickr.com 3389 3262305312_f781590578_m.jpgÂ width=240Â height=97Â alt=MonotoneÂ MIAÂ  > < a>
Amish Country huh ... Well I dont think Texas has Amish ... and if we did ... they 'd have big trucks ... which would completely contradict their religion ... and in that case would no longer be amish . starbucks = 2006 ... well 2006 was a good year ... well maybe youre right ... i just wikipediad 2006 ... nothing really that eventful popped out ... oh god ... im so last year ... what to do with myself ryan
Obliviously you are not gon na be the first Texan here . . you are in the right place . . Qatar living is the best place to socialize with like minded people ... be active here . . you will get to know people even before coming here ... Provided you behave good . . lol Talking to random people in starbucks is not a good idea . . lol they might ask ... ` why you wan na know what am reading ' ??
See you already found one...Rob7-9 . . lol
Hey Ryan - Welcome to Doha !!!! Definately a big change from Texas . The Starbucks thing is definately a bit out of it now . Atleast here in Doha ... coffee is still rockin ' though so its an in-an-out thing ... Columbiano Coffee on CRing by Chili 's is actually pretty decent . I frequently plop myself down outside or on the nice comfy chairs and have coffee and a bit of lunch and internet surf ... great in the evenings after gym anyway -LRB- Al Massa is right behind -RRB- or on Saturdays . Ive struck up a few conversations here and there and ran into quite a few expats doing the same . Good luck Brin
You will do great here . People are reserved , but I 've found if you smile and say hello , they will do the same . You may have to initiate the conversation , but many people will jump in if you start it . Trust me , the endless coffee shops are thriving everywhere , Starbucks , included . Have a great adventure ... it 's what you make it . Sybil <imgÂ src=http:  www.kandjsupplies.com animations pics animal_camel.gifÂ  >

I 've been in a tiny rental car since ive been in dubai ... and yesterday my company was like `` we 've got a big truck for you '' the truck they gave me was a toyota ... I dont know about you all ... but i dont think toyota knows the meaning of big ... nor do my british colleagues that I work with . A real truck is the kind in which you need a step latter to get into . hahaha GYMs ... ok ... because ive been working so much i have eaten an abundant amount of crap . ie mcdonalds , burger king , etc. . . i think ive eaten more fast food in the past month than i have in the past 2 years ... anyway ... are there any good gyms to work out at there ? by good . . i mean , im used to a 24 hour fitness type , in which the gym is huge ... not a hotel fitness room . On a personal note ... I dont have a truck back home ... I have dodge charger ... and if i were to get a truckish type vehicle . . id go for a hummer ... even though they are most likely going out of business Ryan
Ryan , I heard Fitness First has already been opened at City Center . Might want to give it a try ! :-RRB- Cheers , Austin
Welcome to ad Doha , al Rayan !
Texas is a very friendly place ... 1st thing you notice is here nobody smiles except with their friends ... People are not friendly and do not greet strangers with a smile and Hi ; How are you ! People in this place have grim faces matching the dreary desert sand and oppressive heat and rough roads Hey ; Go to Industrial Area and you will have tons of fun :--RRB- LOL
ryan , you may noticed that a lot of people do n't smile . perhaps you will notice also that ladies do n't smile at all. :-RRB- that 's because of cultural differences , i think . back home we smile to strangers , but here if a woman smiles to a man , he thinks you like him and stalks you . arghhhh ... oh , i know westerners do n't behave that way but unfortunately , westereners are not the only ones populating doha . cheers !
I do n't know if you have children Ryan from Texas but if you do and they say Please and Thank you they will be laughed at here in Qatar ! Take them to one of the amusement areas and see how rude the children are here and how they have no respect for lines -LRB- queues -RRB- and no courtesy at all
whats all this thread about ?? people not friendly in qatar ? false they do n't smile ? false again they do n't say plz and thank u ? one more false thing they do n't chat , speak , or talk to strangers ? HELLO !!!
Play nice : -RRB-
FS i do n't know what ur talking about . . Ive lived here all my life and ppl always seem to be friendly i have never come across some guy being rude or obnoxious for no reason with me . . There r the occasional morons at the cinema etc. . but in general i think every here is pretty decent n respectful ... <spanÂ class=inlineÂ left> <imgÂ class=imageÂ previewÂ src= files images coollogo_com_882831935.preview.gifÂ alt=Â width=237Â height=58Â  > < span>
Loathe as I am to make generalization , I disagree Bahraini . COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES , people are not as friendly to strangers in Qatar . COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES - they smile much less . COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES - people here are obnoxious , disrespectful to service staff in cafes , restaurants , shops , disrespectful of queues , non-smoking signs , use of mobile phones in cinames , and children here , particularly Arab kids , are the rudest little brats I 've ever seen . COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES - no , they are on the whole not friendly to strangers . Try living in a western country and you 'll see the difference . People form orderly queues in traffic , at the movies , in shops , everywhere . They do n't smoke indoors . They say please and thank you .
Bahraini and others that think that this is a `` friendly '' and `` respectable '' place are NOT on the outside looking in ...
There was no `` cursing '' in any of the responses on this thread . You love Doha . Some of us do n't . We should agree to disagree . That is the civilized and `` friendly '' thing to do . ; -RRB-
Dude quit it already :P Im not the Peacemaker of Doha or something ... I have a huge list of complaints myself !!! :-RRB- there i said it !!! <spanÂ class=inlineÂ left> <imgÂ class=imageÂ previewÂ src= files images coollogo_com_882831935.preview.gifÂ alt=Â width=237Â height=58Â  > < span>
PM - Is Ramada Signal where the GMC garage is ? And the Starbucks is next door to Johhny Rockets ? Ryan - If the answer to the above question is yes , then I would say this is a good place to start . I am from the UK and everytime we drive past that Starbucks its always fairly busy - no jam packed , but busy enough , and I always say to my husband `` lets stop there for a coffee '' . We have gone there a couple of times and although I have only been here just over 2 weeks , I think it will be my new hangout . Just listen to conversations and you can pick out the english speakers from the none english speakers - although I havent noticed anyone reading books here yet , which is a shame ... maybe me and you could start a trend ! :-RRB- In our old flat in the UK we used to have a Starbucks just a 5 minute walking distance away and I used to go there so regularly that I became pally with the staff and if I wasnt always in a rush , I would have probably made a few friends as well . I am like you , I always want to strike up a conversation with randoms because people interest me and I believe that you never know who you are going to meet . At the end of the day , dont let this thread scare you off meeting people - ok , if they are wearing abayas , perhaps not , but I have found when you speak to people here , they are usually very friendly , more friendly than Dubai even ! -LRB- I have never been to Texas so ca n't comment on that neck of the woods ! -RRB-
BOYCOTT STARBUCKS !
Starbucks britexpat ?
What boycott ? it 's usually over in less than a week ...
I agree with fubar .
I thought u were here in Doha but you are making references to Dubai
no . . im moving to doha ... im in dubai now ...
Dont panic ! Go to Madina Khalifa traffic dept and ask for eveidence of Traffic vilation they will provide you the copy of the picture taken by the radar or if manual it will have the details of the place where violation done with the detail of the officer who booked it simple just check it to make sure than if not your car argue your case . Good Luck
Try to recollect the events and your standard practice of driving in the past few days that some traffic police man is hiding such a way that u would have not noticed and they will take note of irregularities such as speaking in mobiles , non tightning seatbelts , such and such is like that and will be recorded in their system and message may be automated subsequently to appear in ur mobile on this particular day . If u are very much sure , just try madeenat khalifa and ask for evidences convincing the situation as you believe now that you have not moved out the car on this particular day . Good luck
It could be a parking violation .

Hey ! You dont have to go to souq . I can fix your problem if your using a PSP slim . ^_^
Pandora Battery + Magic Memory Stick = Jailbreak . Pandora Battery alone will not jailbreak it ... you nead the MMS with the custom firmware to load and flash your EEPROM .
Unfortunately , there are n't any available hacks for the FW version 4.01 yet . Yes , it 's the same PSP 2000 but it 's the newer batch Sony produced with a different motherboard . So basically we have to wait for the hack to be develop , same goes for the PSP-3000 .
Seek advice from Sony . Goodluck !
Maybe you didnt do the right procedure to downgrade ur psp ? ^ ^
You should take out the pandora battery first after Downgrading your psp . Then use the AC adaptor or your Original Battery for your Psp to install the CFW .
Visit visa is limited for months which if you have if family you can stay up to 6 month in a year and if you have work visa you can stay here for 1 year
Main difference is that a visit visa holder can not work whether paid or unpaid . Whiles a work visa holder can work and stay here as long as the sponsor wish . He need to renew your resident permit every year paying nominal fee .
Work Visa : Enables u to work for a company -LRB- Private or international -RRB- for a period of 1-3years -LRB- Depending on ur company -RRB- in Qatar . Visit Visa : Keeps u in the country from a period of 14days-6months , but not empowered for work purposes in Qatar .
Visit Visa is only limited time maximum of 6 Month and legaly a Visitor can not work . where as work Visa you can work and duration depend for how many years sponser make residency . usually minimum for 1 year and Maximum for 5 Years .
Visit vs. Work Visa 1 . 6 months no extension 1 year renewable each year 2 . purpose is to visit purpose is to work As simple as that .
By the way work visas are also called WORK VISIT visa these days . So that makes all the types of visas ` visit ' visas only , so which type of visit visas difference you are looking .

mr arunkumar i will tell you the most effective solution , a little costlier , but it ensures nearly ONE YEAR RELEIF from coockroadches There is a tube -LRB- like some oinment -RRB- named GOODBY ROACHES costing around QR .45 .

Engaging a carpet cleaning service could become mandatory if you have carpets at home . Considering they are always exposed to the outdoor environment , accumulation of dust and grime is a common affair . For the first few months , vacuum cleaning will solve the problem .
Hiya , Some advice . Make sure that you hire local Carpet Cleaning Companies , for 2 reasons . . firstly , Economics ... the money spend on a local company means that the monies will be re-distributed LOCAL . the second is the reputation of the Cleaning Company ... A local firm have to live within your community , so their reputation is on the line thus ensuring that the job will be done to a high standard . _________________________________________________ <aÂ href=http:  www.arcticcleaning.ie> Cleaning Companies Dublin < a> <aÂ href=http:  www.arcticcleaning.ie> Carpet Cleaning Dublin < a> <aÂ href=http:  www.arcticcleaning.ie> Window Cleaning Dublin < a>

Let him do it ... really if he does n't realise that Qatar is an Islamic state under Sharia what can we do ? Oh I know - say goodbye at the airport when he gets deported : -RRB-
lol oryx - sometimes i really dont understand some people . they come to a country knowing its islamic and still wan na do things against the laws ? strange or shud i say poorly informed ???
oh I know!Paulccherian , youy must go to the Al Fanar center with a prototype of your devontional songs , play it for them and they will surely help you along ! Good luck ! And if that does not work , go to the ministry of Islamic affairs , they may be able to help too !
Let him go to one of those big buildings you see everywhere with the really tall turret in one corner . Especially on a Friday Morning and give out to those friendly chappies with long beards ...

I am not aware of such ones in doha , but u can try Mothers Horlick - mix that u can add with milk anf drink . very good for expecting anf new moms Have a Great Motherhood ** Everyday is a gift , thats why they call it the present **
There is one I know AMNUM , if you can drop by Souq Asiri you can find this in almost all stores there that cater to filipino products , someone told me it 's available in carrefour but i 'm really not sure .
u mean ANMUM ? that 's true . . u can find it in souq asiri ... <strong> I may not be PERFECT but PARTS of me are pretty AWESOME ! < strong>
the milk of the mother is the best of all . because of its container.lol
Who ? Me ? No .
I 've seen AMMUM for sale in Mega Mart at The Center before . Also there was milk powder -LRB- made in Indonesia -RRB- for pregnant mother in the market .
I also saw one in Family Food Center ... near the airport and some Filipino food store .
Thanks for all answers : -RRB-
oopsss sori yes it 's ANMUM sorry for the typo
i suggest not to open internet cafe , time and technology is changed now . internet cafe time is gone , its time of mobile net . always go for the business which has good future feasibility , internet cafe business has no future . just in couple of years time mobile net will be more advanced .
Lol . . do u think people will come to Nefcafe for the internet these days . . ??? Coz its easily available even in mobiles ... so u r choice is not correct , i guess . . choose another business .
i feel opening the Internet cafe is not a good option ... since internet connection is available every where ...
i am agree with others ... no future in internet cafe bsns ... dont dream about it as people will come there and utilize it ... just abandon that idea and try to host a new busnss of mobile , computer , cosmetics , restaurant etc like that DONT SPOIL MONEY AND TIME OKEY
i agree also ... But incase you think of something again doing business you may contact my ID here at QL ... and i can give you assisting and consulting for starting new business . thanks !
Opening up an internet cafe is viable only at certain locations ... well if u have identified one . . kewl But to make it more viable you can really add on value added services ... + + much much more ... My advice ... ... do have your feasibility studies done ... . Work on minimal operational costs & Think Smart ... Best Regards RK Email : eximgulf@gmail.com
You have ` nt mention about your friends ... are they muslims ? I do n't think so any one should have objection on it . . They are not only ur friends they r ur guest too so give them respect .
Kindly dont indulge every matter of life with Muslims . why anyone here have objection to stay with you , if they have Visa & other legal formalities for Qatar . Do you still think ... ... ... ?
There is no law that prohibits you from entertaining a married couple . There is however always the possibility of some narrrow minded person making an objection . This would invariably be a fellow expat who wishes to make a statement in an attempt to draw attention to him herself . 99.9 % safe .
Its just 10,000 Qr , ca n't be 12,000 as for as i know .
hi for family visa temporary visit 1 month + 5 yes 7000 riyal but a a lot of time they accept 5000 for permit visit staying in qatar i think 11000 total salary but they start to accept after 8000
to be sure just go to the Labor Department in C Ring rd. or to messaimer immigration ofc . or to khalifa immigration ofc or to the airport immigration ofc . . hope it helps . .
Some one is asking how far Doha is from Al Khor and the answers are : Potato is for 5 Rial per kg , Banana is available at Lulu etc. .
my frind s workig as mandoub and he said it is just 10000 now and for visit about 6000
ya me also heard about this . .
NO , its a public holiday . So you have get paid for that .
No Way . . Dont keep quiet . How can Eid holidays be Leave without Pay ? Gift a copy of Qatar Labour Law to your HR department . If they still persist to cut your salary go and see the Labour Department officials ... thy will help you .
some people going vacation this September , trying to negotiate with the company to extend 3 days from their planned vacation . for example they were supposed to start vacation by Sept 10 and comeback by Oct. 10 -LRB- 1 month vacation -RRB- and the eid holidays will be from 21-24 , they usually come back by Oct. 13 . something like that .
The worker shall be entitled to annually , leave with full wage as follows : 1 . Three working days for Eid EI-Fitr 2 . Three working days for Eid Al-Adha 3 . One working day for the Independence day 4 . Three working days to be specified by the employer .
Not all companies fall under the labour law troll , you work in the ministry you should know that . QP , RasGas , Al Jazeera etc and the rest of the government are not governed by the labour law , they are governed by their own policy with civil law be the deciding factor . If you are on leave during a holiday , that day is counted as your annual leave . If you return from leave and resume work for one day prior to the Eid holiday then it will not be counted as annual leave . Same goes for maternity leave . Annual leave is paid leave and an public holidays that fall within it are not counted as extra days unless your company has specific policy in this regard . ____________________________________________________ `` Diplomacy is the art of saying ` Nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers ''

No need for a travel agent for tours . Just book the cheapest flight and go directly to Sultanamet in Istanbul . All the sights are conveniently located in that area and there are dozens of hotels that you can chose there and then . We just used the map and walked everywhere !!! Yeh we didnt need to waste money on taxis or othe transport . Let me warn you that mid June and Jult gets very hot and humid but the monuments are certainly worth it . We even walked to the Bosporous from our hotel -LRB- Hotel Ambassador -RRB- and bought the ticket there and then , for the boat ride so no need to spend extra by buying the ticket from a tour operator . Istanbul is beautiful and the kids and i loved it . Cant wait to go back .
Lamea has given you excellent advise . We had a lovely trip 2 years back . All major attractions are walking distance in Sultan Ahmet . We spent 3 days in Istanbul , then took a tour from one of the local tour operators and spent 12 days exploring Cappadokia , Pammukale , Kusa desi , Troy etc. . It was great ... we learnt a lot about history , did a lot of trekking , me , my wife & 3 kids loved the tour . The 12 days trip costed me 1000 euros and about 500 in istanbul . Call me if u need more info ... Cheers Zak -LRB- 6646-8056 -RRB-
Wow . . Thank you everyone . Yes , actually my plan is to travel and explore Istanbul by ourself and get a local tour for trip to Cappadocia and Pamukkale . Or is it a good idea to travel to Cappadocia and Pamukkale without tour guide as well ?? We will be travel to Turkey on end of September . I believe the weather is nice on that month .
Turkey is a mountain country , so travel by train and coach is slow ... i bought the package from a local tour operator in istanbul -LRB- sultan Ahmet area -RRB- . All tour operators give u the same package i.e. the hotel accomo is same ... but the ones on the main street are twice expensive compared to the ones in side streets . We took a luxury coach from istanbul at night and arrived early morning in capadokia ... then took coach to pammukale -LRB- 6hrs -RRB- ... It was comfortable and pleasant ... you can research about turkey on the internet . You dont need a translator ... the tour operator will give u the itinerary for your trip and when u arrive at hotel they tour guide will collect you and they speak good english . When u are in capadokia PLEASE take the Hot air Baloon Safari ... its a great experience to see the chimneys from above ... leave the kids in the hotel because its expensive . Cheers

`` Smoking is responsible for several diseases , such as cancer , long-term -LRB- chronic -RRB- respiratory diseases , and heart disease , as well as premature death .

it 's a wrong parking , trust me . I think their system generates reasons IN ENGLISH randomly , without any order . If you can check the Arabic version , you will see what does it mean . And again , i am pretty sure , it 's a penalty for the wrong Parking . Just go and pay it .
all young poeple should only get their license at 21 , driving in Qatar is quite hectic and you will only just add to horror on the roads sorry ... you need hair on your teeth when driving here ... mayb some people will come up with a different view . If you value your life rather use a taxi

I believe any business here belong to its owner who has put in a huge investment . Why should one speculate on its functioing ?
Is the brothel at the Sheraton open yet ?
safe as mom 's arms -LRB- for the time being that is -RRB- .
Qatar is practically a safe place to live in . No worries that you will be ganged up in the street at night , or robbed in your home . Women are much respected here . I like the way they are being prioritized in long lines at the supermarkets . As long as a woman dress up decently , she will not invite any uninvited stares .
Women are very much pampered here if you walking alone one will hear horns or flashing lights of posh cars slowing down and asking for a lift . . so take care !!! Safe stay in Doha . . it also happens to young boys even ...
Hai Sylvia I have been a staying in doha for eight years and till now I did n't had any bad experience ... I felt it perfectly safe to go out even at night and dine out and shopping ... everything is fine till now ... if you dress properly and behave decently , you earn respect and care ...
safety here in qatar is very well ... where country you will see that police not have guns , , , , , only here in middle east .
Neptune Energy is real ... but what is neptune energy malaysia doing in qatar ... should be neptune energy qatar . . lol
@ siva , they are from malaysia . but the employment form sent to looks not genuine witth a different logo
you better go to hmc opd they will give u an appointment to pediatrician , then dr will refer u to rumailla . in rumailla they will help u by giving speech therophy for ur child . dont worry here in hmc they will help u a alot . hope ur son will talk soon ...
Speech delay alone is not a sign of autism . There are other signs . I would highly recommend that you go to Shafalllah Centre for an assessment , and if he is diagnosed there as autistic or just speech delay , you can go to Qatar Autism Centre for private one-to-one sessions , but this depends on your budget , Rumaila 's problem is that they have very busy schedules and they give you only one session per week and they depend on the parents to continue at home but they are supported by Hamad so you do not pay a lot for this session . But in Qatar Autism Centre , it is not supported but they can give you up to 3 times a week and during the evening and not during working hours as in Rumaila ! Good Luck !
Thanks all for your support .

pedrolics : i tell u finaly . Jackfrost does it
Okay so I asked a pharmacy and sure enough they do do ear piercings . I did n't ask if they pierce bigger than 16G though , I would have asked but she did n't sound like she spoke very good english and me and my family we 're on there way out of the mall . So does anyone know if any pharmacies do larger than average piercings ? Thanks ~

I 've spent the last year driving the car -LRB- Right Hand Drive UK spec -RRB- in Holland , Germany -LRB- http:  www.youtube.com watch?v=RwTTRCgIX58 -RRB- , France and Italy -LRB- which are all left hand drive countries -RRB- ; so sitting on the wrong side is the least of my problems - it is damned easy . I 've already started driving in Doha -LRB- in a crappy company car -RRB- and the driving here is easy , too . As to whether or not the spec of the car is suitable to be driven in Qatar without modifications to AC etc , I shall find out when I call Mercedes , tomorrow . I know that a lot of the specs are above GCC specs -LRB- i.e. emissions , airbags , safety rating etc -RRB- . However , if bringing the car over is simply a legal impossibility , then I 'll save my time . <b> That < b> is the purpose of my question . So , I ask again ; can I bring it over , and if so , how ? Given the credit crunch , it is impossible to sell for a reasonable return , so I 'd rather keep it out here . Thanks
Why not just store it ? Then you have a nice car to come home to ... You ca n't teach experience ...
Will the paintwork of a UK car be up to the rigours of life in the desert ? I thought cars for the Qatar market had special treatment to protect them from the abrasive sand .
I am glad you think everything is so easy , I personally find driving here a bit more difficult than London . I guess I am just thick . Seeing as you are finding everything so easy , go to the Ministry and ask them if you can do it . That 's what I did .
I thought the question was pretty straight forward . Indeed , I shall make all the necessary inquiries regarding the car 's spec , before making my final decision . However , at this time , all I want to know is if it is <b> possible < b> to do it . A simple <b> Yes < b> or <b> N < b> o would do . If yes , then the appropriate measures to do so would be a nice addition . Beyond that , whether I wish to risk <i> my < i> car 's paint work , rubber , plastic , AC etc will be a decision that I 'll take later . Thanks
I did n't crash your response Vegas ? I do n't understand , sorry .
That was n't that hard now , was it .
I may be moving to Quatar in May 2009 . I have the same questions as Shaunconnor and Musashi : 1 . - Can you import a car to Quatar or not ? 2 . - What is involved ? Is it a headache not work taking on or can it be done ? 3 . - What import duty , if any , applies ? My car is a right-hand drive bmw and I am considering bringing it simply because I like driving it . I do n't think heat or sand will be a problem , given that the car has been at home in Louisiana , Texas , New Mexico and Arizona .
go ahead , new experiance .
The department of motor and vehicles might not give you registration for that car if you bring it here .
Can I drive it without a registration ? Like Tourist passing through ?
Looks like my chariot will go into storage for the duration ... Not happy .
Musashi please let me know if you get a proper response since i am in the same boat and for whatever reason i am unable to sell my car in the UK due to massive negative equity amd really must bring to Qatar All I need to know is it allowed - irrespective of the cost
i dont they they will allow RHD 's in Qatar . Earlier it was permitted . From the 90s onwards I think they have stopped giving permission
it is not allowed to import RHD cars anymore .

the shop called Snooker Company -LRB- close to old Mercedes Showroom -RRB- is now closed and I am not too sure where they have moved to . I had bought two cues from them -LRB- WIRAKA -RRB- and they were reasonablly good . I checked out Olympic sports but they only have a few but only one piece .
Check in Nero Bianco . They have Snooker and Pool Cues upstairs .

McAfee is better
Cheesy actually ... Both Norton and Kaspersky are good . . It all depends on your computers specifications : If you are into High security and dont mind antivirus hogging all your computers resources then use my recommendation else >> > If you are looking for Maximum security and fast antivirus capabilites : Nod32 Antivirus If you are looking for Strong Antivirus Capabilities : F-secure McAfee If you are looking for a Strong Antivirus with Medium based internet security : Norton Avira If your looking for Free Antivirus with fast Scanning probes : AVG Personally I use Nod32 Antivirus and a Zone Alarm Pro Firewall -LRB- yes Nod32 has its own ESET firewall . . but I prefer Zone Alarm -RRB-
1 . Bit Defender 2 . Kaspersky 3 . Webroot 4 . Nod32 5 . AVG McAfee no. 9 , Norton no. 10 LOL ! http:  anti-virus-software-review.toptenreviews.com
AVG ... and its FREE
NORTON is way better ... You can also try Symantec .
Milkshake maker ?????? All blenders are milkshake makers . LOL !
rude . . tried camels milk was not really bad . . but how will i shake the cow or camel so guarantee milk gets really shaked nomad . . thanx for the info . . will check them out today i guess
This can be arduous and many have to be tested before the final choosing of the `` best '' one-however once decided upon , their performance can rapidly decline to an unacceptable level . These MUST be discarded and traded in for better models ASAP otherwise there can be very High maintenance costs !!!
uk . . are english any better ?
I have been 2 many places and seen and tried many milkshaking machines and they all work wonderfully whilst shiny and new . They soon drop in performance , and this is not anything to do with the manufacturing country ! The only way to prevent this is to be able to afford many different models and use them infrequently to prevent wear !!
sounds like an experts opinion . . mind telling me about the best and the long lasting ones ?
There are actual Milkshake blenders but these are not practical as all you can do is ... well , make milkshakes . You are much better off with a hand blender . They have a deep measured glass you can make milkshakes , smoothies etc in , and if you want you can also use it to blend soups and such . There is a very nice moulinex one that has attachements for chopping and grinding but it runs about 600 + Qr , but very handy . I myself have a small black and decker which cost under 200 . ____________________________________________________ `` Diplomacy is the art of saying ` Nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers ''

first pls do n't eat fry things to stop the pimples second use medicated soap & keep away from other 's family members third consult a good doctor if you want home based product then contact with me .
Go to the pharmacist and ask about Retin-A gel cream .
hi ! i have break outs a few months back , no doubt exacerbated by the weather , dust and food here . before , i used to have few pimples but it was hormonal -LRB- i only have pimples after college already -RRB- so my ob-gyn prescribed a low dose birth control pills for me -LRB- diane -RRB- . it worked actually but since i do n't want to be under medication on anything for a long time , i stopped taking the meds . i tried lots of over the counter products but not all of them worked as advertised . now , i 'm using st. ive 's facial scrub -LRB- gentle -RRB- , followed by an exfolliant   lightening product -LRB- extraderm-a filipino product -RRB- then moisturizer -LRB- olay complete -RRB- . thank fully , the break outs subsided . i guess , you have to use gentle products and stick with them if you are okay with them . -LRB- i have used clearasil before but it is not effective on my skin -RRB- then stay away from fried food esp . chicken and dusty places . i had a major breakout when i was still living in gharaffa which is very , very dusty . if you want first aid -LRB- when you have to go on dates or impt . functions -RRB- do these steps : 1 . clean face 2 . put ice on the pimple for about 10-20 mins . this will lessen the swelling . 3 . dip a piece of cotton on fresh lemon juice then placed it atop the pimple for about 5 mins . this will lessen the redness . feel free to pm me if you have further questions . .
Hi Kindly avoid Chocolates , oily foods & wash face with normal water . -LRB- Not cholrinated -RRB- Store water for 1 hour and use it . You feel better and confident in two months of time Neethu
Thanks guys , your advice is taken and compliments of the season to you all .
Rein A is effective but first you have to find something to peel the outer part of your skin ... this will make any over the counter cream effective . Maxi peel is used for at least a month but avoid sun while using , better yet use only at night , and lots of moisturizers and sunblock in the day . Peeling of the skin is good so as to take out all old skin where dirt hides and and when infection occurs , it freaks out there the pimples cause . But after few weeks of peeling , you can then proceed to retin - A for complete medication . Chocolates or sweets or fries is not really the cause , but makes the pimples big it triggers to be big , itchy , red , and swell . Avoid spicy too , drinking citrus juice helps to shrink them . If this pimples really big and all over your face and even at your back , better consult the doctor to take medicine intake , i forgot the name , but i will get back to you soon i remember
Is retin-A -LRB- tretinoin -RRB- available over the counter in Qatar ? It 's also a good anti-wrinkle cream .
If he is not blacklisted by saudi , he can apply
He is not allowed ` dual GCC residency ' . If he does n't cancel his Saudi visa it will automatically expire 6 months after his departure and then the ban time starts . If his visa is cancelled by his employer it goes straight into ban period -LRB- however long that is in Saudi -RRB- . Suggestion ? Get a new passport to reenter another GCC Country . Have met many people during my stay in Qatar who have done the same .
I had a couple of guys in our company who were banned -LRB- not only cancelled -RRB- in UAE and they got their Qatari work visa with the same passport . Only in some specific cases , the ban is imposed in all the GCC ... not in all . As far as the dual GCC residency is concerned ... I dont know about all the GCC but Qatar allows you to keep both by paying a fee of QR 2000 year . The information is available on the MoI 's website .
I doubt ... . . let him try his LUCK !
He can apply to another country in GCC if his Saudi visa is cancelled .
That is why they called it GCC , entire region of gulf countries . He can apply to any GCC country except saudi with his new passport . Otherwise , NOC is a requirement .
There might be a 6 month period where he is banned in the GCC overall , but the 2 year is only applicable in the individual GCC Country .
No ban in GCC , only in KSA . He can still work in any other GCC , irrespective of the ban in KSA !
He can apply for other GCC countries .

Thanks Luciano ! I must admit , I did n't make it to the Ramada and did -LRB- sadly -RRB- end up in Champions . The big problem with Champions was the lack of sound as I like hearing the commentary . Are we able to hear the commentary in Ramada ? If not then I guess I will watch it in my hotel room . I wo n't be able to have a beer but I will at least really enjoy the cricket .
Yeah that 's what I 'll do in the short term when in the company 's hotel apartment -LRB- got sky player so can watch most things live then -RRB- . Would rather have all the sports channels when I get my only place
Which hotel ? Movenpick Towers is too slow to run anything useful . Just about get away with TVCatchup but forget iPlayer , 4OD , Sky Go Player ... need too much bandwidth . :-LRB-
I 'll be staying in the Asas Twin Towers Apartments in West Bay . Obviously I 've not idea what they have there ! If the internet is too slow then it 'll have to be the pub for any sport until I sort my own place out when the wife comes over at the end of summer .
OK , so you should n't be too far from the Marriott then which will at the very least , cover the usual selection of sports . Failing that , you also have the option of the Ramada but that 's a bit further out of town -LRB- 5 each way in a cab -RRB- . I personally am not a big fan of Champions -LRB- the Marriott -RRB- but I will if I have to . Also , as these pubs show many different sports they rarely put the sound on ... although they did for the footy the other night . Of course , another option would be to go sit in champions with your laptop , stick your headphoness , tag on to the free wifi , fire up the VPN and order a beer ... ; -RRB-
Ok thanks for the advice ! I 'll be looking for somewhere decent to go for the Euros , especially the England games . Will be over after our first game . Once I get my permanent place I 'll sort out my sports based TV package !

the cheapest rate we had the last time we rented a car was for Qr60 per day , Honda Civic 2005 . Go to Bin Omran , there 's a corner there after Badriya signal with lots of car rental services and I think you can bargain for a lower rate if you will rent for a month or more .
You will get for 1000 Riyal sure but for 15 days only ??!! you can rent a two wheeler for 1000 Riyal , before you post such a idiotic question you should know the price of a vehicle and the market . If you can open car rental business for this price I am the one to fully book your vehicle first .
1000 riyal per day . . sure . . why not ?
Yes , but you will have to peddle with your feet through the hole in the bottom of the car . A bit like Fred Flintstone 's car .
Will depend where your husband is working , position and contract.Typical working hours is 8 per day , as per labor law . Mostly people in senior position do n't get paid OT .
Depends entirely on your position and where you are coming from . The day typically starts much much earlier than in Europe and somewhat earlier than the U.S. , but it also finishes earlier .
Pace is slow , work pressure has to be less than anywhere else in the world . Working hours vary but unless he is working for a contracting company he will be free by 5 at max so your husband will have plenty of time for the family here .

The problem with finance is that people are often expected to work Fridays , because the rest of the financial world is still operating . This often means only a one-day weekend , particularly people working in the international sectors .
Sa165 , i am not sure what is easier , to find a job when you come with your spouse or when you come alone . . I think these two are irrelevant and have nothing to with each other . As for `` to come or not to come '' , it obviously depends on your hub 's salary . Depends on what you are giving up ...
Thanks all for your answers :--RRB- -RRB-
Mohammed good to know ;--RRB- we are planning to flight together , we are waiting for his work permit and we were assuming I can automatically go there . Tks for clarifying .
You could fly together , but it would depend on your husband 's company in terms of what arrangements they could make for you . You would have to come in on a Tourist or Business Visa . The latter is more convenient and will be valid for 3 months -LRB- although will have to be renewed once a month -RRB- . During this time , your husband 's papers should be sorted out , and he can then sponsor you as his family . Your Business Visa would get converted . You could find work with your new Residents ' Visa . This is more advisable because once you are sponsored by your husband , you can take up or quit jobs like in the ` normal ' world . Should you come here sponsored by a company , you 're stuck with them , no matter how badly things might go . And if you quit , you 'd have to leave the country and not come back for 2 years . It all sucks , but that 's how it is : -
chocaholic , this is really helpful and covers everything :--RRB- thanks a lot !!
Sa , do n't ask your company for business visa , it is an incompliance issue , you r not eligible for business visa . Whoever advise you to do so , advise you to violate the law . Also company might not like it at all . You as a Canadian can get visa upon arrival at Doha airport , which is valid for 1 month and extendable for another month . Once your hubs RP is finalized , he can sponsor you -LRB- check this point with his company prior to traveling ! -RRB- . As for changing a job , there are certain rules with regards to this matter . You as sponsored by you hub can quit change the job any time . He can not change his sponsor any earlier than 1 -LRB- sometimes 2 -RRB- year s . If he got so-called no objection certificate -LRB- NOC -RRB- , he can change the company with no problem . Ask him to check with his company whether providing a NOC is in their policy or not . If no NOC is granted , he has to leave the country for 2 years .
It is the companies themselves -LRB- both in my case and in that of several others that I know -RRB- that advise the Business Visa . But if Tourist Visa works as well for her , then it 's for the company to advise so . The Business Visa is renewable for up to 3 months and if needed , one can do a ` Visa run ' out of Qatar and come back to get another Business Visa valid for yet another 3 months . This makes it all much easier , because there 's no telling how long things take to get done here . Especially with her husband 's RP . My friend 's took 3 months .
As far as leaving the company goes , like Qatarisun said , this depends on the NOC . Usually , it is safe to assume that you would have to leave the country - or this is what I have heard from most people . In any case , getting an NOC is NOT something to depend on , as you would never know until you 're actually at that stage . If you have a family here , you would n't really want to be coerced to leave and not come back , would you ? It really is best to wait to be sponsored by your husband . It takes a little patience and time , I know , but in the middle and long run , it 's a way better bet , all things considered . You must check with his company about how long before he can sponsor you - from what I understand , that varies with nationality and level of seniority . I know someone who was asked to wait 6 months before he could sponsor his wife - apparently Qatar 's ` probation ' period :-RRB- Anyway , for starters , get in here together on tourist Business Visas -LRB- let the company HR advise on and handle that ... every company has different degrees of weight they can pull :-RRB- -RRB- , look around , settle down and wait till your husband can sponsor you . Good luck !

Chicagos own Lupe Fiasco was on CTL tonight Skip http:  www.youtube.com watch?v=26X8ant7qtw
The biggest bat in the world just flew into this room ! It flew into every wall like 5 times , and right at me a few times . As soon as it landed I grabbed the garbage can dumped it out and stuck it right on him . . He 's trapped now . I put a weight on the can and he 's flappin around like crazy . . I 'm waiting until morning to release him . Wow - I 'm not scared of much but I do n't wan na get rabies
Tinkerbell , whats your favorite movie ? I just got done watching Larry Crowne . . I gave it an F - Julia Roberts ca n't act and Tom Hanks is just gay Worst movie ever
And if I try to let that bat go outside now he 's gon na fly right into my face ...
The lil guy is just as frightened as you are . Release him out by pushing the bin slowly towards ur door and lettinghim out . He may die in there flapping all nite .
If tat bat faints inside tat garbage can are you gon na give the bat a CPR ? : -LRB-
I know what 's Manna Pro is looking for , HBO means Home Box Office Channel for Television cable , it is an english movie channel . Try to subscribe to Mosaic or The TFC or try also the free satellite feed channel
All the movies stink . . Its very rare that I see one I actually like anymore ...
We seem to have more TRASH dished out in the name of entertainment . Sad ...
Its a big garbage can and i 'm afraid if I try to cover it with something it will slip off , the bat will fly out and i 'll never catch it again . . I have to wait for help in the morning . .
I could write better scripts than they do in Hollywood
i wish my ol pal Dracula was here ... :-LRB- to see all this torture to a poor bat ... : -LRB-
Manna , dont you think it would be a boring if everything was the same everywhere you go ? Of course there will be a culture shock you 'll be half way around the globe ...
I do n't mind different , but I hate boring . I need TV at night , before bed or I ca n't sleep I just saw something move around mt feet , I thought it was the bat . . Musta been a shadow . . I hear him sqeeking in there again . And I found an open window in my daughters room , he musta got in through there . . Wide open with the air con on ? When i tell her what flew in shell never do that again
Manna - all i can say is life anywhere is what you make of it . You can make it interesting you can make it boring . The PLACE has nothing to do with it . Its the people . And no this is NO JUNGLE or DESERT as you may believe . Culture Shock will defo be there . We all have it . But its not all that bad . And you always have a choice to leave the place if you feel you cant take whats dished out . And no this is not the usual QL LINE of leave if u dont like it . You do have a choice is all im saying , .
How do u manage with just ONE EYE LP ??? Tedious eh . . : -RRB-
LP he says he is from the jungle ... ; - -RRB-
These are whats available here . http:  tv.mozaic.qa channel_packages.html And i do believe HBO is a paid channel .
I know one HBO ... Hamad Bin Osama ... I am not sure he is the one you are looking for ...
I can see this is going to be a tremendous culture shock .
ha ... you are in luck ... we get around 2300 channels Satellite ... ... lot of playboy and similar channels off Hotbird sat ...
Manna - u seem to have ZERO knowledges of whats happening here and just shoot ur mouth off . We dont watch Camel races and goat cooking shows ! We may have limited channels as compared the GREAT US of A but we DONT live in the jungle ! Do your homework before you insult !
Whats your favorite show Tinkerbell ? I like Chicago Tribune Live
Manna I hardly have time for TV given my schedule but yes there are some shows that I do like to watch like White Collar , NCIS , Castle , The CSI shows , Hawthorne , Body of Proof and the like , And you can also subscribe to the OSN in case u do fone Mozaic Limited and comparatively it IS limited !
I suggest staying in USA if you want to watch Chicago Tribune Live . .
Many of the shows HBO produce would be cut to pieces here if shown . A nice 1 hour program would be down to about 15 mins , due to the super sensitivity in this region .
hhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa good luck waiting for an email response ... you made my day you are dealing with Government - wake up and smell the coffee only way go there at 8 AM of you have the mobile number of someone who works there and can help you out
Yes looks like this is what I will have to do , thank you for location details . Is there a Ministry of Health Building in Qatar as it is a Minister that I am trying to set up the meeting with ?
Hi , yes was hoping someone here would have a contact there and give me their number !!! If not , then I think a visit will be the best way , I only want to book a meeting for people visiting from UK !!
Thank you guys . .
Canned food might include many preservatives , additives , flavors , colorings . Most are not natural products . Rather artificial . I am talking about the Eeeee 's family . I am not sure if there are any studies in this regard . But there are warnings about additives . Check the ingredients and do some research about the E-family . Here is a link to start with http:  www.ukfoodguide.net enumeric.htm In my opinion . A nice presentation has nothing to do with the way you prepare food . For example salad is usually a cocktail of vegetables , possibly some fruits , possibly cheese and ham . You can simply mamage a nice decoration for the top part and forget about the lower part . If you watch how Jamie Oliver prepares the food , you will be amazed . In no time he can prepare food and arrange a table with a nice variety and it looks yummy = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = http:  www.qatarliving.com node 58409

All you need guys is a good knife and chopping board . Regarding tabboule . Nothing will do but chopping the parsley by hand -LRB- knife board -RRB- . Even if you manage to chop the parsley , you are stuck with cutting the tomatoes . They have to be cut into 5 to 10mm cubes . My information about healthy salad , is to chop the green leaves and herbs by hand -LRB- no knife -RRB- The funny thing when they say `` This gadget strips lemons and oranges of their outermost peels , which contain limonene , a compound that may decrease cancer risk . '' and somewhere else thay talk about a can opener . When cans are involved , cancer is there . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = http:  www.qatarliving.com node 58409
I dont think you will find it , but there is a herb chopper here . It is basically a rounded 2 blade knife which is rocked back and forth over the leaves to make them this way . You should be able to find it in Lulu quite easily , or any supermarket for that matter . ____________________________________________________ `` Diplomacy is the art of saying ` Nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers ''

For the budget they have , one can send all HMC patients to Mayo Clinic and still have more money left . JCI is a management accreditation , not quality . HMC dares to publish a survey showing how many of their top staff , or their families , actually use the service of HMC .
JCi is a very good accrediting body which provides correct tools and solutions to any healthcare organization . Proper or Actual use of those tools rests at the hands of the staff . 1 . Implementation is such a different issue . that depends on the staffs ' intellect , willingness to adapt new processes , as well as their genuine service , not to mention that they should have real educations , not fake ones .
JCI is directing all departments for the right procedures and policies.to be honest if JCI is not visiting , there are enough staff just neglecting their work . that can be seen just before jci visit , their running everywhere . do n't know what to do.coz they were not working.if we do daily updates and follow procedures ccomplete our day-to-day work and responsibilities , we do n't have to scared of jci.what i noticed so many departments , heads are panic and updating everything only just before jci visit . i am really happy to have jci visit every month .
visa on arrival costs about QR130 .
<p> Is the visa upon arrival still stopped and if so is this permanent ? < p>
<p> visa upon arrival was never an option for Filipino nationals . <aÂ title=ViewÂ userÂ profile.Â href= user bzfshzn> Bzfshzn < a> , if you are american , you still can obtain a visa at the airport , whfor QAR100 , valid for 30 days , and extendable for another 30 days . < p>
Only carry the current passport . Get all your active visas from the old passport transferred to the new passport .
If the visa already in your new passport , they will never ask for the old one .
It 's interesting how the answers differ here on QL . Do you know now what to do , Felix ? Or would n't it be better if you asked the concerned authorities -LRB- if you can find out who they are -RRB- ?
LP i agree with you , such issues should be asked with the concerned authorities otherwise carry both the passports nothing to loose ,
well if you have a renewed passport and your RP is on the old one you have to carry both until it 's time to renew your RP which they stamp it on your new passport , then you only carry the new one : D

First the international Driving License is not a Driving License , Just a translation of your DL in several languages and should be provided by an official authority not by any web-based agency . Second , this does not replace your DL , and you have to keep both documents with you . Third , the Qatar DL is NOT recognised in many countries , I just checked in France and Belgium and this is not the case at the moment . So check before for every country you plan to visit , since in several countries you will not be allowed to drive . Generally speaking it seems that it works with reciprocity , nationalities that have to pass the driving test here come from countries that do not recognize the Qatari driving license . This might chance since it seems that obtaining the DL here is getting harder .

State of Qatar does n't allow practice of Homeopathy , tough luck .
That might not be the case flexicode . From what I 've heard there are places here that do provide forms of natural alternative medicine , which they call here ` ilaaj tabee-ee ' . I know that the Boots store in uk stock homeopathic remedies but I 'm not quite sure about the Boots here , but its still worth continuing to ask around or when in doubt call up 180 and ask if they have any numbers for places that practice natural medicine or homeopathy .
uk_qtr , the practice of homeopathy is prohibited here by law , but if somebody is practicing it under a different name , I do n't know . However I will be happy to find a good homeopathy practitioner in Qatar myself . Lets find it and whosoever comes across one , will inform the other . I will be working on your ` ilaaj tabee-ee ' clue. : -RRB-
Thanks guys , well actually , cant understand why its forbidden in Qatar , I need homeopathic remedies for myself and my allergies , otherwise I would have to take commercial medicines which are heavy in side effects . Homeopathy is just great , a little plant can make miracles . If you do find out , please post it on the forum again . Thanks -
What if I get it sent from Europe to my address as personal medication , would that cause any problems ? This is really something that buffles me not to give another euphemism .
I think on business visa you can not get visit visa for your dependents . you should have Residence permit to get visit visa for your dependents .

Almost all 5-Stat and 4-Star hotels will have very good Christmas cakes .
no clear favourites till now , i guess . . mercifully , nobody mentioned oriental bakers and family bakers . . no offence about their cakes . they are ok but was looking at something that will be remembered -LRB- not for the price tag -RRB- . .
ive tasted al bateel , opera , and four seasons , the best is albateel ... give it a shot ...
The best cake you will ever get during this season is the one that you make at your house . Surely al bateel , opera ... will be good , but cant be compared to the one served with love
I have to add that they provide accommodation . Not an allowance .
I think it 's small
that is more or less QAR6 .5 K. i think that 's a bit low , but if they pay for your accom and schooling for your kids -LRB- your two biggest expenses -RRB- , you could be making some saving ... maybe just get them to specify the nature of the perks ; i.e. accom = flat or villa , transport = ? . also , do they provide you with return tickets per year for you and your family ? hope this helps .
LOL Dracula !!! I also thought it was a bit low . I 'm now on almost tripple that in my country , but offcourse not have any ohter benefits . Thanks Dukes . I will ask them to send me a more detailed breakdown of what they 're offering . But overall , I think I need to negotiate for a bigger basic .

'' Nearly two-third of Qatar 's population consists of males , reflecting a very low female sex ratio overall . Like other Gulf countries this fact can be attributed to the presence of higher number of expatriate male workers ' population living as singles . The female sex ratio on the contrary is low to very low in old Doha area and in the out side urban areas . Exceptionally , the industrial area of Zone 57 has just 3 females per 1000 of males .

Any suggestions of where I can get an answer to my original question ? LOL ... . or if there 's any female out there -LRB- from the same planet -RRB- , that does understand my question -LRB- which was in clear English -RRB- , please answer me ! Hehehehe . Grrrrrr !
The only way to determine if it 's a decent package is to try and assess your living costs and determine how much you would be able to save . That 's what the majority of people are in Qatar for ... to save . It 's difficult to fix on a salary as there are so many extras -LRB- as others have mentioned -RRB- such as education allowance for kids , housing , transport , possibly a furnishing grant etc. .
Prada , Package is fine in itself , it combines all major costs , hence you will be able to set aside little . But you will not be living like a king . If your salary back home is equal , stay away . If this is a major improvement ... why not .
Thanks for the replies ... now we 're getting somewhere hehe . We 're a family of three . They will also cover schooling , which is great , since we have a 2 yr old . I think it 's okay , since they will cover all major costs . At the moment , we 're looking at saving about 2000QAR . DH will also have to find a job once we are there . I have requested a detailed breakdown of all the extra 's they will be covering , so I 'm waiting to hear back from them . If they cover all major expenses -LRB- housing , schooling , transport , relocation , medical -RRB- ... 6400QAR + DH 's salary are not to bad -LRB- I think -RRB- .
Prada , do NOT come for less than you are making in the US . The standard recruitment package for Americans is your current salary plus 25 % overseas benefit plus housing , transportation , tickets , medical and schooling for up to three children . You 're being low-balled , honey , negotiate for more ! You wo n't have the chance later , believe me . Mandi
PS , Prada , is your hubby 's nationality US ? There can be some issues with your sponsoring a husband while he is working . You need to check this out as well . Mandi
Ha Vegas , see my comment above ... it is tooooooooo easy !
I was SOOOO in a different page : O
Thanks for your replies Mandi and to the boys ... please grow up ! We 're South African ... opportunities for white South Africans are very limited in South Africa , so we are a bit ` desperate ' at this stage . But , I 'll negotiate for more ... !
Oh , sorry , I see South African now ! Yes , do n't be afraid to politely negotiate - tell them what your salary is now , they will respect that . Mandi
In west bay ? Or at West Bay Towers ? You will be looking at 7500 QAR per month and upwards . However Ezdan has cheap accomodation in west bay - 3500 pm on a long term contract .
Thanks Azamat . I 'm looking for accommodation at any one of the towers in West Bay . QR3500 is a pretty good price . What are the tradeoffs ?
it 's a one year contract . i think the 3500 apartment does n't have a kitchen . the ones with a kitchen costs almost double . 6500 i think
The tradeoffs ? Other than what Wirehead mentioned above - Living in Ezdan will remind you of prison cells in Shawshank Redemption . Not to mention , Ezdan has the worst fire safety record in Qatar .
Without a kitchen ? How is it an apartment without a kitchen ? Mandi
that 's what the guy i talked to said when i asked about the rates in ezdan . probably more like a hotel room instead of an apartment ?
Mandi , originally Ezdan was built as a Hotel , then they re-built it as residential appartements . . I guess they left few smallest appartments without the kitchen as a hotel room . . the layout of the flats sucks -LRB- some flats built in a way that you have to cross the bedroom to get into the kitchen -RRB- , quality sucks , and it 's already feels old and stinky ... Since they rent out some apartments for the short term like a hotel , you can imagine what 's going in the lobby every day ... people with the luggage , coming , leaving . . Quite depressing place . I could recommend it as a temporary accommodation in the West Bay for those who just came in Qatar , has a workplace in West bay and is intending to look for the place to live at the same area . .
I have lots of ideas send me the money and I will direct it to your instructor ... .
It depends on his her nationality . How about a common gift like a Camera or a watch , suits your budget . Remember , feelings are more important ... A chocolate with small card saying `` Thank you '' is also good . Congrats and safe driving
I always do that , decently attractive guy , fit . Always dress nice but no dice ... I just think QA works differently as far as upgrades as most other airlines . Maybe 500qr in my Passport may help ... LOL
Well , I can double what scmasse has said and will have 1000qr , in my passport on a certain date that we can discuss via PM . If you work at QR , have the ability to upgrade , and want a little extra qr ... just PM me .
They sale most their seats . So no room available for upgrades . Round trip to Las Vegas is only $ 4500 if you book through United .
Doubt it will happen . 420 you are resorting to the straight out bribe ? That ever work for anyone ? So ... Dress nice , Bribe , Beg , Plead ... pull out Credit Card and pay for it anyway ... a little something like that ?

last time when i went on moon the guy who sold us sandwich and tea spoke good english u should talk to him .
visit the filipino expat group here in ql kabayan there is a thread explaining the process , hope it can help u.
you can print it out from the website , then send it to ur family in phils den cal DHL for the next procedure . or better to take zilam advice so u can get more detaild info . . gudlak :-RRB-
you should send through dhl the letter of support and the visa then your wife will send her passport and visa through dhl again to the embassy at philippines . . take note only dhl was an approved one to send those kind of stuff . . after the release from dhl . . khalas ... she can come here to visit you ... i did those things before . .

thank you all for the help ! For Marnelli , can i directly send the visa , their passport , and letter of support to DHL -LRB- since I have their passport here -RRB- , then can DHL send this to them in the Phil ? For the letter of support any format you have?It would be highly appreciated if you have . Thanks !
Visa Approved what next ? Just bring them . congratulation . no need for original print out , just print it from the internet or send it to them via e-mail . hope u enjoy with them .
You can do the following exercise for Family Visa Step by Step 1 . Print out the visa and sent to them via e-mail 2 . On the original passport insert the Visa copy , NBI copy , 2 x 2 Picture white background 3 . Advice them to go to nearest DHL office in your area 4 . they will pay 2500 Pesos for DHL charges 5 . Wait for 7 working days they sent you SMS for collecting the passport from DHL office . 6 . after you receive the original passport from DHL verify the Visa Stamp in the passport . if ok then go through Travel Agency and book them according to your wish . They have 3 months validity to enter Qatar . 7 . In immigration they will ask so many question but if you tell them that your husband or wife is an Engineer they will not think twice they will stamp quickly and say ok . Welcome to Qatar

It can be done in Qatar By Giving NOC . She does n't have to go out from Qatar and Why She need to change from Husband to company as She have the privilege to work anywhere being under Husband Sponsorship ... ...
i think you have your own reason on doing this.but i suggest not to .
The originals will need to be attested   stamped .
same question you must asked that HR people whats they need actually , and doubtless it must be translate one . original must keep with you for any future requirements .
So far I know that all the Original certificate should be attested and keep a translated one with you when you gon na submit for any government department .

How long is a piece of string ? This is Qatar . The probability is that rents will go up . .
i m worried abt the shawerma price : P
already up !! Habibi
Please be careful . Pay two riyals more and buy good quality shawarma only .
Higher , higher ... the market demands it
What do you mean official ? Any reports are only guesswork . Yes , some landlords are putting their rents up because there 's a demand on certain properties in the market . Anything that 's popular and decent quality will probably see a year on year raise ... if you do n't like it , they just rent to the next person . On average though , there really should n't be a raise !
It depends on your house rent contract . My contract is yearly , and this year they increase the House rent by 6 percent .
yes !
i have seen many vacant flats without occupants . 2 bedroom flats are now available for 3500 . but real estate agents are spreading rumours like rent up and high demands . many landlords who were reluctant to reduce the rent last year , reduced their rents and also announced free offer due to vacant flats
Where are these 3500 flats ?
does Samsung Galaxy S2 has the GPRS facility and is it Free too ?
can we install this TomTom in S2 ?
Buy iPhone and install TomTom in it . . TomTom is the best . . I have already tried it in Dubai , Saudia , Qatar , Pakistan , Germany , UK , Melbourne and Sydney ; never regretted .
No , there is no Android version of TomTom ...
Rizks , No you ca n't install Tom Tom on Android ... Go and buy iPhone 4s and enjoy it ... ; -RRB-

GPS N GPRS different ... for independent GPS without need of any GPRS , go for Garmin n load middle east map 2012 . reliable
Nokia Mobiles
Nokia mobile with navigator . It 's FREE .
Better buy Nokia E7 . The best for GPS & free voice guided turn by turn navigation . You can use this feature free of cost not only Lebanon but all over the world . Another advantage of E7 is that it has the latest GPS locking technology . Another advantage is it has beautiful 4 inch touch screen used to navigate easily . Good Luck .

Thank you Zuha , sahanab , Translator , NOMS , Marod and Mahan . I ll utilise all the information and plan my trip accordingly .
it varies no 2 babies are alike . You need to ask your doctor and trust your instincts as a mother .
Dear lauraferns , I 'd suggest you to watch your baby 's growth closely and at some time around 4-6 months , you may notice that your baby is not getting enough from your milk . -LRB- This is purely subjective but you are the best person to make the decision -RRB- . At this stage , you can start a little -LRB- spoonfuls -RRB- of rice water , egg yolk , a few squirts of orange juice etc. . , in the beginning and if you find that everything is going well , then you can introduce some more new items - one a week or so . Gradually you will find that your baby is enjoying all these new foods . Remember to keep up with the breast milk as long as possible along with these weaning foods . If you would like to include cereal , you could do that too . By 1 year of age the infant should have had a taste of everything you ever want him her to . I would advise you not to add sugar or salt additionally in any food item because you may be introducing an unwanted habit for life . Good luck with the weaning . AP
No 2 babies are alike.Check with your doctor . I started semi solid for my kid after 6 months and solids after a year . .
From what I 've been told and have read ... it 's best to wait until six months for most babies -LRB- always check with the baby 's doctor -RRB- . This is a great website that I used often for food recommendations for babies : http:  www.wholesomebabyfood.com  They also have great information on what foods to avoid until the baby is older . Good eating to you baby !
Best age to introduce semi solids is when the baby is 6 months old . Do not introduce salt and sugar to baby 's meals untill he   she is 1 year .
thank u all
For what I have read in the site , yes there is a way . Since your current sponsor employer does not want to give release NOC then move back to your country , wait for 2 years and then come back . Sorry but if you can not get NOC then the most likely situation is for you to go back home . Regards !!
If they did n't give you a NOC the only way is to go back . . but when your old company and the new company have same sponsor , then the new company can ask for the NOC and hire you and you dont have to wait for 2 years !
this may be - if your employer dont have work and not giving you salary human right commission helps some times , but dont ask me where are they ?
Their official website . . http:  qiqatar.com  check .
Thanks for the website . I am looking for some inside information from people who may have worked there or dealt with them in the past .
It is a good company , you can join if the package is ok with you .
QIq near american hospital in c ring u can see a green clour bldg go to first floor ? which dept u got offer , it is a good company , now it is more good and well paying too
Hi there , I wanted to know if you joined QIQ and whether they are a good company to work for etc. . I have been offered a place with them as well and wondering as i dont know much about them and i would have to uproot from Dubai . Is Doha a good place for a single western expat or is it more family orientated ? Any info would help Cheers Sam
as many as mentioned in your contract .
In terms of legal its 8 hours only , beyond that is overtime . But yet there is no definition for word LEGAL in many companies . Everything is based on ones contract .
Hi If there is some fine print in Arabic in your contract , there is no other choice :--RRB- . Professionals in white collar jobs work from 7.30 Am till 3.30 PM noon . No fixed work hours for laborers and contractors , but , they can ask for overtime pay . Cheers
Officially , 8 hours a day .
It should be mentioned in your contract . Most of the Companies are having a contract saying 48 hours per week at the rate of 8 hours per day .
Its difficult but possible with future prospects and promotion . The cost of living is beyond anybodies control and current financial crisis . If not many options ; one could grab this opportunity .
yes . . and you can save about 2grand . . !
We live with the same package with 2 kids . It is very difficult . If you have another choice is better to take that . It is really though to live here . Yes of course you can survive , if you live very very simple and no saving . But I think you must want a better life . SO DONT TAKE THIS OFFER unless the company offer more min 13 grand
yes you can !!! After reaching Doha go to LuLu Hypermarket try to get a raffle coupen ... u may win a car ... !!!
I thnk you can , , since you are from my country . . LOL witoiut accomotion , you get 7000 ... I think you can . Bengalis normally are nornomaly not showing extravaganza so u can save too . . most of the members in QL - are highlving , posh people , we can not blame them . They have their lifestyle , u have yours .
No Way !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You cant servive with family in 7000 QR
It all depends on ur life style actually ... there r people living in Qatar with as long as 2400 Qar -LRB- thou , not that they hav their families with them -RRB- . But then again , everything ends up with the way ur life style would go .
you can just try and sure you will and also have savings
no ... try to negotiate more ...
minimum 10000 qr month
yes , you can live happily without any savings !!
OK here is my advice . fill in Qatar before you leave then fill up again just when you are leaving the Saudi Boarder , this will be the Saudi side before the UAE boarder . This should be enough for to get to Abu Dhabi or even Dubai . Because if you miss this Petrol Station then the next station within in UAE is atleast 100km . This is from my experience of 2007 , I dont know if they have built any more Petrol Station since then . Also a small factor to consider is that Petrol in Qatar and Saudi is cheaper than UAE . Have a safe trip .
there are many petrol stations from UAE-KSA border to Abu Dhabi
There is a petrol station less than a kilometer after going thru the saudi border from qatar -LRB- right side -RRB- . There is another one a few kilometers before exiting saudi to the UAE -LRB- left side -RRB- . There is a petrol station a few kilometers after passing thru the UAE border -LRB- right side -RRB- . This is the last petrol station along the highway before reaching abu dhabi proper . Keep in mind the petrol price in UAE is 3x compared to saudi . I hope this helps . Have safe trip .
Poolplan you made my day with your answer ... I needed that laugh
Mostly named after a Landmark , Building or Office nearby ... like Manna'i Round About , Marmar Palace Round About , Wholesale market Round About etc. . Some are funny though ... like the Slope Round About coz of the slope in the Round About .
so PLZZZZ help . . where can we find a list of all those funny places . . corresponding to a decent map . . ?

A Police Clearance Certificate -LRB- PCC -RRB- from your country of citizenship is mandatory during sponsorship transfer . At the Indian embassy , the PCC -LRB- for Indian Nationals -RRB- will be issued within 2 days . Need to fill up the form and 2 photos and around 80 QR . This PCC then needs to be stamped at the Ministry of Consulate Affairs -LRB- this is the same MOFA but they 've shifted and renamed this section , the building is on your right when traveling from Munthaza signal -LRB- Radwat Khalil intersection -RRB- to Gulf Cinema signals . This document then needs to be submitted to your new sponsor , they will get a medical date for you -LRB- yes , it needs to be done , even if you 've done it before for the previous employer -RRB- . When the medical result and PCC is submitted to the CID , you 'll go for fingerprinting and then in 2 weeks CID will either approve or deny the sponsorship change . If the sponsorship change is approved , they will give you   your sponsor your Qatar PCC . End of procedure . Enjoy new job : - -RRB-
I do n't speak Tagalog . Please answer in English . Thanks .
yes it is mandatory .
Yes , It is mandatory . You can obtain it from your Embassy .
Yes Dear When u change sponsorship police clearance s mandatory.u can get easily from your embassy.then u want to make stamp in foriegn ministry qatar
Megamart and carfor , some local good bakeries have it as well .
Leelah , There is a substantial difference between `` Whole Wheat '' and `` 100 % Whole Wheat '' . The first is bread made of a mix which includes some -LRB- usually low quantity -RRB- of whole wheat . In Carrefour and local bakeries , you can only find `` whole wheat bread '' !
Thanks all . The bakery at Le Cigale , does it have 100 % whole wheat bread ?
<imgÂ src=http:  stahlsbakery.com images BreadWhite.jpgÂ width=420Â height=420Â  > Taash k paton ki manind hai zindage meri JanI , Jis kisi ne bhi khela taqseem kar diya mujhey ...
To my knowledge , 100 % whole wheat bread in Qatar , is only available in imported pre-packed sliced bread , at the Megamart in The Centre . People here are telling you otherwise because they confuse `` whole wheat '' with `` 100 % whole wheat '' . If anyone knows other sources here in Doha -LRB- make sure you are talking specifically about 100 % whole wheat -RRB- , please let me know .
Bateel have branches all over the place . My local one is on Ras Abu Abood Street beside McDonalds <aÂ href=http:  www.flickr.com photos b_2_d 3615935822 Â title=TheÂ PearlÂ DevelopmentÂ PanoramaÂ byÂ baldrick2dogs,Â onÂ Flickr> < img src = `` http:  farm4.static.flickr.com 3351 3615935822_2ca87f726f_m.jpg '' width = `` 240 '' height = `` 57 '' alt = `` The Pearl Development Panor
baldrick , Thanks . Do you know if they produce and sell '' <b> 100 % whole wheat bread < b> '' or is it just '' <b> whole wheat bread < b> '' ?
yes it is transferable to working visa .
Yes transferrable , but subject to availability of new visa with the new employer -LRB- same nationality , but still for females again different visa -RRB- .
i knew it , u guys here are great , thanks for the info : - -RRB-
LOL Why dont you get a life ???
mega mart might have one but sometime sold out quickly !!!
Thank you all for your assistance : D
THE DAY WAS FULL OF JOY BUT AFTER FIREWORKS SSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIIIIIITTT
i really enjoyed staying whole day at corniche ... waving out the Qatari flag ... rushed with the crowd ...
Watched it all on Telly ... was good : -RRB-
well me i did n't enjoy as previous years :-LRB- . .
I liked the fireworks display ... nuff said . . : P
We reached Cornish at 6 PM . Nothing except huge crowed . They put 3 TV and there was nothing to show . All the time showing sea , some dead man , old houses , fire etc. . At least they should have broadcasted morning event or some dignitaries meeting and wishing other dignitaries . Only entertainment was that an old gentle man was asked by police to move away from some area as it was for the family but that man refused to move and there was long argument . The man flatly refused stating that where it is written reserved for the family '' He also called 2 ladies and asked if they have any problem if he sits here . Ladies told No , He then asked police that if ladies have no problem then what your problem is . You being a man , you should also move and keep lady police in family zone . The police man got fed up and left the place but police man was good and never lost tamper . Realized that quarrel or argument can also be entertaining and good times pass . Even some helicopter was flying ; every one was looking at that . Overall it was not very exciting , just watching crowed and children . Fire cracker show at 8 PM was fantastic . It was worth watching .
did ' t get to see it . . :-LRB- work work work ...
enjoyed with the whole family .
Princesssarah ... lol yah but most of them were doing arabi girls dance lolx ... they were doing it for fun ! :P to make people laugh ;-RRB- ...
That is the way we chit chat . We are simply not the `` Yes No '' kind . . : - -RRB-
ya i enjoyed a lot parade and evening fire works also enjoyed a lot
Nope , I was in Alexandrea yesterday morning & just saw the fireworks when we are about to land here last night .

I love Qatar . I enjoy every bit of it . I still miss old Qatar . We also decorated our Pajero and it was great fun to stuck in traffic and to watch the Qataris celebrate their day and firework was amazing .
Fireworks were good , but nowhere near as good as last years.Most folk on Corniche were expats ... all vehicles were full of Qataris , snarling up the roads , revving engines till they backfired alarmingly with flames coming out of the underside.Very odd behaviour , but they seemed to be enjoying themselves !
how could u enjoy if you are n't here?it 's obvious u did n't . . The OP is referring to people who were here during that day . .
Nomad - thats something we all need to think about ... dont understand why some ppl cant pick up after themselves ... : - -LRB-
Now that the festivities are over I 'd like to point you in the direction of this article from the Los Angeles Times -LRB- http:  www.latimes.com news local la-me-fireworks4-2008jul04,0,245124,full.story -RRB- that discusses how awful for the environment fireworks are . Turns out the answer is `` really bad . '' In fact , concentrations of fine particles , or carbon soot , skyrocket for up to 24 hours after the show , reaching levels as high as those from wildfires . Also , traces of poisonous metals , which give fireworks their bright colors , and perchlorate , a hormone-altering substance used as an oxidizer , trickle to the ground , contaminating water sources . One Environmental Protection Agency study found that perchlorate levels in an certain lake rose 1,000-fold after a fireworks display , and they stayed high in some areas for up to 80 days . Yeah . That 's not really good at all . But because fireworks are so cool , we 're probably not going to stop using them anytime soon .
Spent the day at Sealine Khor al Udaid -LRB- dune bashing -RRB- ... evening at Corniche . Fireworks were awesome .
PincessSarah , its also obvious that you did n't read my post properly . Who says I do enjoy the celebration ? Sleepy honey ?
by far , just201025 that was the most sensible thing to do ! Good job !
i missed to watch the National Day celebration ... too bad , that was suppose to be my first time to see it :-LRB-
fantastic fire works
SeanC the allknower ... its an yes no answer question ??? would you mind answering the OP . . quote the OP `` and what all have you done in the national day . . ''
i had a great time at the movies watching the best drama this year `` fair game '' .
I 'd enjoyed the firewords from the roof of my building . . It was amazing show and unforgettable moment for my baby too . .
soniya did you enjoy the carbon and perchlorate emissions too ? They were simply amazing !!! Oh and the poisonous metals from the bright colors ... awesome !!!!
ENJOYED , BUT AT THE SAME TIME BADLY TREATED BY A QATARI WOMAN JUST BECAUSE WE STAYED NEAR TO HER , SHE DID NOT EVEN CONSIDER THAT WE JOINED HER TO CELEBRATE THEIR NATIONAL DAY
Thara - cud u plz turn ur caps OFF ??? its considered SHOUTING to be using CAPS ... . plz ... my ear drums r ready to burst !
the fireworks must have ruptured Thara 's eardrums ... hence she shouts !
u mean vocal chords Sean ... . .
I went to scout a suitable place to bring my family . LOL , I was unable to get back to bring them though . But I had a great time . Enjoyed the parade and everything . Firework were spectacular . When I got stuck in the traffic I passed my time doing tasbehat .

yes , you can , only if do have a valid liquor license from QDC .
Mscgyver is right , you can only bring wine outside Doha Airport if you have a liquor license .
A BIIIIIIIIIIG NO ... Well ... if u r a visitor or a transiting passenger , u can bring it . But the Customs guys will retain the bottles with them and you will be given a receipt . While travelling back you can claim you bottles . But as for bring the bottles into the country ... NO No
No you cant.You can buy in Doha at QDC , where you have to take a permit .
If you have doubt about Qatar . Ask QL !!! :-RRB- thanks guys !!!
I am talking of a cancelled RP , it is not that the cancellation is still on-process . . so the question is , can my company apply for reinstatement ?

Happy New Year ! Yes it could be reinstated , my company has done it before . .

Home of Sir Donald Bradman . This is the part of rich people live once they retired . What a nice place is that . it is like you are living a Beautyful garden . All buil ; dings are like old england style . After 5.00 pm all the people gather in the Englsh style pub for a beeer or two.Everybody knows each other .

Thank you oh so very much for such great insight and information about Australia . We changed our mind as it will be winter there and I 'm not much of a winter person . We will , inshallah , be heading off to Malaysia and Thailand . Any ideas ?
I 'm headed to Bangkok and Siem Reap myself on the 22nd ! I love a combination of the bustle -LRB- and shopping ! -RRB- of Bangkok with a beach resort such as Koh Samui down south . Then maybe visiting some indiginous villages , elephant trekking or ancient sights up in the Golden Triangle . My girlfriend and I are going to spend three days at Angkor Wat this time . Mandi
I 'm going to look those places up now . I 'm excited for the trip . I neeeeeeeeeed this break AWAY from people .

Relax in the natural paradise of Noosa With a laidback vibe and no buildings higher than the trees , the sub-tropical paradise of Noosa is a place where you can really relax . But that doesnt mean theres nothing to do here . Noosa brings international resort glamour to its pristine beaches , national park and lush hinterland .
There are many great places around Australia , Sydney and the Habour Bridge , Brisbane 's Story Bridge , the Gold Coast , Melbourne 's Yarra River , Perths 's Bell tower and Northbridge night clubs , Tasmainia 's mountians , Broomes beaches , the list goes on

Yes , I visited Australia this year in April . It was fun there . I visited Sydney and Melbourne . In Sydney , I visited Opera house , Sydney tower , Sydney harbor , Darling Harbour , Botanic Gardens , Blue Mountains , three sisters and Jenolan caves . All are must visit places . In Melbourne , I visited Great Ocean Road , 12 Apostles , Warnambool , Ballarat , Gippsland lakes , Penguin Island , Yarra forests , Melbourne city , Crown Casino . Remember , I am talking about only one city and state Victoria . . Whole Australia is a tourist place ... I could n't go to Gold Coast but Insha Allah next time I will go there first . People are very nice and cooperative , we did n't see any racism and rudeness stuff . Regarding shopping , Australia is little bit expensive but DFOs are reasonable . Now a days there will be winter over there . Sydney has pleasant weather but there are four seasons in a day at Melbourne . Winds are very chilled in Melbourne . If you find time , travel between Sydney to Melbourne or vice versa by road . I missed it but I heard it is fun . Have a nice trip !!! If there is any further information needed , let me know .
in sydney shopping malls closed at 5 pm , been there with my kids so were given priority on the tourist places we visit , thats the only good thing travelling with kids you dont have to q.
Thank you so very much . Very useful information and I will list it all for reference . :-RRB-
OOh I forgot to mention ... visit Sydney Aquarium and Wildlife at Darling harbour also . These both are in Melbourne as well . You will be surprised to see Australi 's wild life ... I have also forgot to mention Sovereign Hills -LRB- old Gold Field -RRB- , there is live museum or it is called theme park . They have setup the a city of 1850s and all people are working there in old costume , it is fantastic place I hav ever seen ... and yes make your mission that u have to see Kangroos and Koalas live on roads and trees . In case of Koalas , I touched it and spend some time with Koalas in Sydney Wild life but I had decided that I will see Kangroos live on roads or in jungles ... and atlast I have seen them in Gipsland ... OMG they were huge ... . If someone ask from me which one was the best place , I will say , `` I am in love with Great Ocean Road '' ... .
Dont know the status now , but i know it was only for families ! heh .
It closed a long time ago
abandoned
there is no longer something called -LRB- aladin kingdom -RRB- they closed it long time ago !!!

Your phone should have come with a disk to install on your computer . There should be several phone shops out there that carry or sell the usb cable to connect your phone to your PC . You can also use bluetooth to connect your phone to your PC but no matter what you are going to have to have the software to do it . Hope that helps . You need W800i software USB cable or Bluetooth device for your PC or laptop After that backing up should n't be an issue . ______________________________________________ Brazilian Jujitsu in Qatar http:  iloveqatar.net bjj

Hi there , There are many Bicycle repairing servicing shops in Doha . The one I used to go is behind Souq Najada . Direction to reach there - if you are coming from crazy signal or Toyota signal towards Bank Street , take a left from the signal in front of CBQ , then take right -LRB- behind CBQ -RRB- , go straight , take a left turn when you reach next intersection , towards end of the road , before entering the next intersection , you have a bycicle shop -LRB- opposite Qtel entrance of Souq Najada -RRB- . You may have to park your car in the underground parking - QR 1 riyal -RRB- . Second option - Electricity Street , opposite Bombay Silk Centre on the same line with Dulhan .
In mansoura , near carpet centre
I know one at Mataar Qadeem ... . . very near Taste of Asia Restaurant . Have to carefully looking for the shop as the shop is very small .
one you can find in Bin Mahmood near Badria signal just opposite to badria Resturant

Go around in shopping malls sometimes they have sale ...
In my case they need attestation of the last one .

Look man . . the easiest way to satisfy yourself is to call airport or cargo department ... I 'm sure they will satisfy you !! cheers
Ziplock bags , chocolate chips and pie pans you can get here in almost all the shops -LRB- definitely Shoprite & Megamart -RRB- . Canned pumpkin - sorry do n't eat it but they seem to sell every other kind of canned product here ! Cookbooks and books - Loads of places to buy books here so do n't worry . A lot of people organise book swaps and the best place to buy them are all the table top sales ! Diet root beer - ca n't help you on that one but Shoprite seem to sell a lot of american brand drinks but they are quite pricey . I would be really careful bringing them over though in case they leak etc. . www.qaws.org
Canned pumpkin is sometimes available at MegaMart , but if you want some for this Thanksgiving then I would bring it with you just to be sure . I did bring a HEAP of ziplocs with me from the U.S. They 're pricey here and I have only found the good freezer bags at MegaMart for $ $ $ . Seriously , I went to Costco and purchased a couple of packs of the Gallon and a couple of the quart . Have n't regretted it yet ... BUT ... I also had a 40 ' container and almost no furniture so it was a no-brainer for me . You can get chocolate chips here , but in the event that you 're a chocolate connoisseur do n't count on the good stuff . The waxy-tasting Nestle is about as good as you 'll get for chocolate chips .
Best place for baking stuff -LRB- including chocolate chips -RRB- is Shoprite - they have Hersheys choc chips :D ... One for me ... One for the cookie dough ... Giant Stores do cheap freezer bags of every size imaginable but they 're not the zip ones they 're just the press shut ones . . www.qaws.org
I 'm bringing the Splenda cause we just stocked up at Costco before we got the interview . That stuff is expensive and VERY lightweight :-RRB- I appreciate the syrup suggestion and all the others . How bout coffee ? Do they have Foldgers -LRB- husband 's fave -RRB- . He is getting weird about the idea of not getting his -LRB- exactly the same every day lunch -RRB- preferred foods .
diet root beer is sold at megamart and various stores , I can hook you up lol it 's A&W brand
Hi there , Definately bring out the Splenda cause it cost a bunch here ... I actually have a friend of mine bring it out for me each time she comes from the States ... All the other stuff you will get here - might be a bit pricier than what you would pay there but hey - as long as you can get it . The root beer am not to sure about ...
Fresh ? I find very little of our produce to fall under the category of what I would call `` fresh '' ;-RRB- Yes , bring some canned pumpkin just in case MegaMart runs out . You can find regular ol' ziplocs or generic ziploc-types . . . but the freezer bags that really hold up are not readily available unless you pay $ $ at MegaMart . -LRB- That said , I have n't tried Shoprite . -RRB-
all 5 Thanksgivings I have had here . Just do n't wait until the last minute and you 'll be fine . I still have 3 cans from last year in fact . I can buy freezer bags practically anywhere . Decent choc chips come and go . Just stock up when they are here and put them in your freezer . I do buy cookbooks in the US each summer , only have found British ones here -LRB- besides the US current best sellers -- which are expensive ! -RRB- Diet root beer can also be found -- sometimes . I tried to find a pie pan all last year and know they NEVER had a proper one at the grocery stores . I bought a new pie pan in the US this summer . My advice : do n't bring food . My employer did n't allow it anyway , and most do n't .
At the end of the day you get use to stocking up on what you like when you find it here , and if you ca n't then learn to substitute or do without . I stopped bringing food back years ago . Our bed mattress was the best thing we brought over . Ca n't find the quality here .
Do n't stress about the pie pan , I bought three of them and we 'll be going to Sri Lanka for Thanksgiving - it 's the same as second Eid -LRB- Al Adha . -RRB- Mandi
Mandi , better stock up on cranberry sauce too !!! We 'll take it all Mwa ha ha ah . Splenda is available here in the diabetic sections of most grocery stores - I would n't bother bringing it with you SJ . Signature line > `` You ca n't fix stupid ''
to my knowledge its Home Center . till date ive had some really good furniture from there . but there are many other shops too ... visit the city center or villagio mall ... u will find many outlets ... happy buying !

the best time to migrate to Qatar for a job is whenever you got the Job Offer . . otherwise how are you planning to `` migrate '' ?
All 365 days are peak period for job seekers in Qatar . There are hundreds looking for job openings with in Doha , some of them are lucky to get at 1st attempt and many are desparate even after 2-3 months . Again it all depends on the profession and compromises for having landed here with out a job on hand . Some say '' Trial costs nothing '' but here trail costs a lot to find a job . Still best of luck , try online vacancy 's and apply .
Almost all rent contracts include a no-subletting clause ... So he wo n't be able to do it .
Bleu ; Most properties are actual sublets by agents , if you read my answer again , you will understand what I am talking about , as long as the sublet is done legally meaning with a contract between the Agent Landlord and the tennant it is legal . Subletting does n't only mean renting out a property that was rented from an agent without a contract . these are facts .

Great - thanks !
i would say go with it , but i do know they are looking to change the sponsorship rules over here and make it tighter for companies so you may want to look up the changes before making a final decision
change the sponsorship rules ! am hearing that for last 5years and nothing is happening not a bit so no need to worry just go ahead fattoun . <imgÂ src=http:  www.qatarliving.com files images Da.gif>
Never heard of SPANCO so do n't trust them . Its far better to be under the sponsorship of the company . If they really want you that is what they will do .
better get the sponsership through Vodaphone . do n't go with Spanco . KinG-07 `` Winners never quit , quiter 's never win ''
hi wish to know how it possible to know my sponsor . It is written in Arabic and also i wish to know his her obligation for me .
You are their slave . You have NO rights .
Depends on the company , if they have allocation for indian visa . If they do have one , dont worry . If not count your luck

It 's one of the greatest pleasures for a father to teach his children how to swim . What about him ? Busy ? Money is more important ?
I can ask my wife if she wants to do it . It will cost about 500.000 Riyals .

Then <b> his < b> father is to blame . He can still `` teach '' it though .

agree browsing has been much better , yesterday when i did manage to get qtel on line , all the customer helpdesk could tell me was they were facing some general issues , nd that it should be fixed in 2-3 hrs lol and the cables gon na take atleast 15 days . .

Since the initial problems when the cables first broke Qtel or whoever will have re-routed things to other cables . That 's why things are a bit better now . But things may get worse again tomorrow when the weekend is over and businesses are back to work .
I had really slow speeds and packet loss this morning , then it improved for a bit . Now it 's pretty bad again . I think we can look forward to one or two weeks of bad surfing .

They estimate it will take til end of the year to fully fix the problem . I expect that the service will slowly improve as time goes by .
Ive never heard about any `` the under water cable being severed '' till I came to qatar . in middle east for some reason it happens few times a year . . why in the North American part of the world `` the under water cable '' never severs ? <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed .

You 'd be less likely to notice even if they did , as most of the sites you access from North America are in North America . I expect you 'll find local sites are loading at usual speed -LRB- try www.gulf-times.com , for example -RRB- . It 's the overseas ones that are slow -LRB- like QL -RRB- .
I doubt many websites are actually hosted in Qatar , or the Middle East . Most will be in the US .
Actually it seems Gulf Times in hosted in the US as well .
Does anyone know a company that hosts its website in Qatar ? I 've found two : http:  www.qatar.net.qa  - Qtel http:  www.moi.gov.qa  - Ministry of Interior Most of the top-10 local sites -LRB- nine , probably -RRB- are hosted in USA . Any others in Qatar ?
QL used to host with Mediatemple , which is based on virtualized servers , but when the traffic took off they switched to <aÂ href=http:  rimuhosting.com > RimuHosting < a> . There are now two data centres in Doha . One run by Qtel , the other by Meeza , which is part of QF . I just do n't know the reason why any non-governmental website would host in either of them . I know that before QL switched to RimuHosting , they were paying $ 100 a month for hosting . Now , I 'm sure they 're paying more , but not huge amounts more . Both Qtel and Meeza are never going to be able to compete on price . Nor are they going to be able to compete on support . QL is number-three in the top-10 websites in Qatar , and it runs on free software . <aÂ href=http:  www.qatarliving.com user kutch> Kutch < a> does a great job of running the local free-software group , but there just are n't the numbers of Linux experts in Qatar to be able to provide good support services . The other reason you might not want to host in Qatar is the local legal framework . Hosting in the USA is sometimes frustrating if you receive a barrage of DMCA takedown notices , but at least the law is well-documented . Here , you ca n't be sure that someone with a bit of wasta would n't make a phone call to Qtel and shut you down . Of course , there might be a technical reason to host here . If you needed low latency . Maybe the data centres are full of companies ' file servers ? However , even if I was running an system that require a low ping , surely it 's a safer bet to host in Dubai ? Any examples of locally hosted websites ???
yup its undersea cables cut check out todays gulf times its all splashed on the front page
The under sea cable cut at Alexanderia - Egypt so the internet and telecommunication is badly effected in Middle East , Asia and Europe

No governing rules will work here practically . If the landlord wants to increase the rent he can create any reason to send you out from his property . Now no need to worry about the increse in rent . Rent is coming down drastically . Change the house
If you have a written contract with the owner , and this contract is signed on or after 01 01 2005 then he has NO RIGHT to increase your rent up to 14 02 2010 as per the law . If the contract is signed before 01 01 2005 then an increase shall occur as per the following table : - rent amount less than QR 2000 >> > 20 % - rent amount between 2000-5000 >> > 15 % - rent amount between 5000-10000 >> 10 % - rent amount more than 10000 >> >> > 5 % In addition he can not kick u out UNLESS you did not pay the monthly rent , or if you rent the flat to others , or if he want to use the appartment by him or his family mambers , or if he want to demolish the building and most of the above has to be through court evidence , , , also there is 6 months afetr you got the information in written before evacuation .
Rents are supposed to be frozen until Feb 2010 . Just find a new place . You will likely find better and cheaper . Leave your greed stricken landlord without a tenant . That will wake him up with no income coming in .
well the rent depends on the area where you want to live ... staying in Doha City area is still expensive even you transfer to a newer flat or villa . If you have car , you can get a cheaper rooms outside Doha and just get-up earlier when going to work .
get your own place , rather than sharing , it 's about time
Assalalamu Alaikkum , Along with the family visa application , you need to attach copy of below documents . I recently got my family 's visit visa transferred to resident visa .

Birth Certificate of your children -LRB- Attested by Qatar Embassy in your country -RRB- -LRB- if you have children :-RRB- -RRB- 3 . Passport copy of you and family . 4 .

I hope someone will share they experience in processing visit visa to RP . . where we will go to apply in immigration or in labor?thanks ...
bring your dog to wakrah mangroves .
Do taxis allow dogs ? What is the general attitude there ? My dog will jump up a little and try to say hello !
dogs are generally seen as dirty , or nijis , so people will frown upon them but it isnt prohibited to walk them outside . ofcourse there are many areas where dogs are prohibited but not in open , public areas -LRB- excluding parks -RRB- also , if your dog says hello and jumps up that will frighten many people because alot of us here have little experience with dogs
Train your dog NOT to jump up on people . Hmm , maybe a taxi will allow one in a crate . Mandi
He is still maturing so that will come in time . He is generally well behaved and will be muzzled and on a harness .
IN your home ? Good grief !
Dont Feed them , and dont keep you Dustbin outside , when they will smell nothing and dont get food they will move to some other place .
contact the government vet or Cats in Qatar . I understand you dont like cats yet please dont be rude to them ! thanks !
Can you please tell me whether the original passport is required or not ? And is credit card required for fee payment ?
And can we do it at Old Airport or I have to go to the Madina Khalifa area ? And timings ?
my visa is still under process . what if i have only visa paper -LRB- no card -RRB- and all other documents . . ?
You just have to SHOW the original UAE license to traffic department -LRB- graffa -RRB- they will give you the qatar license . provided you have iqama -LRB- RP -RRB- , other wise you will get temporary license with out any tests . NOTE : - you do not have to handover the UAE license .
one more info need , pls tell me all the documents required for this procedure at trffic department .
If you are on visit visa : - 1 . N.O.C from the sponsor . 2 . original passport . 3 . fees QR 250   - Note : License will be issued till your visit visa is valid . If you have Iqama -LRB- Resident Permit -RRB- : - 1 . N.O.C letter from the company . 2 . Original passport 3 . Original I.D. card 4 . fees QR 150   - Note : - license will be issued for 5 years FOR BOTH THE LICENSES YOU NEED TO GO THROUGH EYE TEST .
You dont want ride your bike when it is 50 degree celcius outside . And for ` landcruisers ' bikes are bearly ` see-able ' .
Not even in the winter ? I would say that cycling is pretty much my main sport at the moment - would be a shame to give it up !
Fifty degree . . Bike . . Cycling Shorts . . Could be a recipe for disaster . . :-LRB-
pedalcycling in Doha ? remember , Qatar has a long way to go before cooler winds blow sparks again ... best is to get curled in your cave and reserve your energy to your diversion back to your home country where you used to stretch your strength there dude ... think safety than fun ! > <aÂ href=http:  s185.photobucket.com albums x25 casabella1434 ?action=view&current=filex-1.gifÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http:  i185.photobucket.com albums x25 casabella1434 filex-1.gifÂ border=0Â alt=Photobucket> < a>
If you are living in Al Khor a bike will be useful . We live in Dukhan and my husband cycles everywhere . It is perfectly safe within the community but I really would n't go on the main roads . My husband bought a mountain bike here for 240QR , it 's not the best one but is still going strong 3 years on .
That 's a bit more positive ! Thanks , it 'd be nice to have the option to get around . Looking at the tour of Qatar routes , there look to be some great 100k + loops out and around Al Khor . http:  www.letour.fr 2009 TQA COURSE docs parcours.pdf
From your post , I sense you 'll be quite depressed without your bike . A friend of mine shipped his from the US and now enjoys the -LRB- safe -RRB- daily rides as early as 05:00 am , to avoid sun strokes and heavy traffic . I agree with Jasmine , you can ride where you live . Also , you can engage in biking contests and events , held every now and then in Doha . Stay happy . Salam
If Al Khor is anything like Dukhan , , you 'll miss your bike just to get around . I feel so lazy driving everywhere and I miss mine . Biking in Doha would be synonymous with ` Death Wish ' but otherwise , bring it . I 've yet to find a place with deals like you get in the UK -LRB- although I suppose it depends how much it costs to ship it -RRB- . I wish I 'd brought mine . I bought 2 for my kids over here and they 're pants .
Can one bike around neighborhood areas ? We 'll be out in Al Duhail North , and though I do n't intend to allow my children to bike Arab League St , I was hoping that I 'd be able to send them the 1K from our compound to the nearby park on `` unnamed '' -LRB- at least on Google Earth -RRB- streets . Okay , or do n't even think it ?
LOL Rizk - u never ever needed one did ya ? ... hahahahaha
Looks like u ued the scissors way too much ... now u r bald !!!
check it out at Centre point or at Villagiio ... u might surely get there .
i think u can get it in Souq Asiri ... your best bet is to call any beauty Salon in Doha and ask them where to buy supplies like these ... i know there is a place ... NAZIH if im not mistaken ... you can get all these kind of supplies there ...
I thought everyone wanted thick hair . . what 's thinning siccors ... and whats it used for ?
Thinning scissors are used for the layered effect . : p
fs , not only for layering styling but really , there are women like me who are so feed up with our thick wavy hair ; hence we need it to be cut thinned esp at the back .

i hope ur car loan will not b matter in ur UMRAH trip.INSHA ALLAH bkas u r going to take return ticket and ur visam is going to b issued as UMRAH VISIT only ... so carry on ur plan ... any how get more ideas from others also ...
Yes dear , you can go with your car but one of your relative or your friend should keep his her a guaranttee cheque to bank .
Yes , you can go easily . The best way is to get a letter from the bank after you introduce a sponser for your loan . However , I travelled twice with my car which was taken through a loan , but no body in Abu Samrah borders ask me for this paper . God bless you . Pray for us in MAkkAH .
Yes , I have done the same this year in July , no questions were asked and my car is under Doha Bank Loan . Please drive carefully specially between Riyadh and Taif take the center lane for safety .
no one will ask u anything as long as the car is registered in your name you have nothing to worry about , just drive carefully and pray for all of us ...
not all bank bwtter to call the bank before you leave 100 KM goinig and 100 KM retorning for nothing
you have to get a letter from bank dear , thats it
Sure ur visit is going to b short period i.e max . one month so no problem dear . .
dont b afraid my friend ... 6 months back . my friend 's boy friend came here from oman . they stayed 2gether 4 1 month . nothing happened ... only thing is dont tell 2 all . keep it as a secret thats all ... its true that its against law . u decide man ...
feel free men and enjoy it ;-RRB- just you have to keep it as a secret thats all
Enforcement of the no-cohabitation rule seems to depend a lot on your accommodation . Do you have a door man ? Does he make visitors register their visits or not ? If you live in a compound , do the guards register visitors ? I would not try such a visit if living in Ezdan Towers or a similar -LRB- horribly run -RRB- accommodation .
she ca n't stay at your place . -LRB- but she can visit * wink * -RRB- *****
if its worth the risk ... to not entertain trouble just follow the rules
It 's strictly prohibited in Qatar to stay together if the man & woman is not legally married . Take Care
You risk arrest and deportation . Your decision whether to risk it or not .
visiting you and get deported , it is beter you visit her and keep working otherwise you are inviting trouble along with her . Choice is yours
In law we do not have GIRL FRIENDS.So MOI give visa to wife only.Incase USA or europe also they will not entertain GIRL FRIEND visa . Allowed category is FAMILY VISIT visa .
Grow up asif ... he hehehe
You both are european , she can come without visa , and get it in the airport . Do not announce it !!! No body will know She can stay upon her Visa , as much as she wants . People do not put up their nose in others things . Cheer up and let the comments of inexperienced people . let them say whatever they want . I am European as u and know much more things than the far east and Asian Nationality . If you need help just PM me .
I think u get a minimum of 28 days , before a fine is imposed . . but then again , it depends on visa to visa ... !! Is it a valid RP visa ... or a visiting visa ?
So 7 days is lax already ? Is it already come back to 3 months ? Thank you
In the passport it says that you should report to the expat office , if you have done the medical it 's ok , you still have 3 months to process your RP without penalty .

memor ... most of your posts revolve around poverty and similar themses . In your profile , your nationality is given as Qatari . If you are indeed a Qatari , then why talk you of fun without money ?

if you have nothing to do in life . . then visit Lulu ...

Embassy of Canada to Kuwait and Qatar There has been a mutually-supportive pattern of political cooperation between Canada and Kuwait , based largely on a commonality of views and interests .

as far as i know it 's no less than 21 days per year so it can be both but minimum is 21 days .
21 days per year base on the basic salary
Article 54 of Qatar Labour Law states that : In addition to any sums to which the worker is entitled to upon the expiry of his service , the employer shall pay the end of service gratuity to the worker who has completed employment of one year or more . This gratuity shall be agreed upon by the two parties , provided it is not less than a thre-week wage for every year of employment . The worker shall be entitled to gratuity for the fractions of the year i proportion to the duration of employment . Tha last basic wage shall be the base for the calculation of the gratuity .
It is 21days . I got it in april 4m my old firm .
Hi , Just be very careful . If your company askes you to take some extra '' long leave '' & you go back to your home country , there 's a good possibility that you 'll miss out on this payment - unless you can get back into the country to claim it . Only a small number of companies doing this in the down turn , but worth keeping in mind .
thank you all for replying .
NO .
used tires are scrap and not fit for use . so look for a scrap company where you can dispose .
Less demand for used tyres and used wifes ?! both cause danger to life ?!

I already asked permission from my company and they told me to submit my school certificate and they will do the rest . And they informed me also that I need to attest my certificate first from my country -LRB- Philippines -RRB- before giving it to them . Now , my question is , where can I attest it , what agency ? ------------------------------- Ang baril pag ikinasa , sure na puputok.Tamaan tepok . http:  qatarslife.blogspot.com
Follow the normal procedure for attestation of certifcates . For School Diplomas : 1 . Get a certified true copy from the Univeristy you had graduated 2 . Go to Ched and have it certified 3 .

Do you know 80 % of Qatar population lives in Doha ... so why 5 years ... even now we dont get parking ...
Urban planning in Qatar ????!!!!!!!!!! you cant be serious ... does urban planning ever exists here -LRB- in reality -RRB- ???? . look at the planning , and do we have a record or data to forecast population , supply and demand curve made ??? nothing in reality . . its high time , attention is paid and streamlin these essential and depriving status ...
You forgot to add , though , that the driver must stop so that he is blocking all traffic so the person being dropped off wo n't need to walk more than 4 meters to the door .
Expat Sueno ... you sounds like my husband :--RRB- 4 metres is a long way if you are obese and have to walk in the 50 degree celcius weather .

Hi , There is no need for Exit permit for Family
hi , For Visiting visa their is no need of Exit permit , if you extend or not , Only RP person need to have Exit permit
Yes , there is a new rule which require exit permit for males above 18 who entered Qatar by visit visa . I asked at the office when I issued exit permit 2 months ago .
Exit Permit Compulsory for Expatriate Males above 18 years who stays for more than 30 days whether resident or visitor Pls find link from MOI website below : http:  www.moi.gov.qa site english news 2012 09 11 26770.html
Thank you so much . At least for my sister she 's exempted ! : -RRB-
yeah ... i read some posts on Qatarliving too about missing packages ... !! I am going ahead to claim the insurance for the package ... but ... I preferred the package rather than the insurance ... !!
My wife sent me a pair of shoes from Germany , I have not received it until now . It was sent 15 years ago .

No as per my knowledge tourist visa can not be converted into visit visa , i have tried this a year back , now if the regulations are changed i dontknow .
I already applied for the tourist visa after I learned that there is no salary requirement for visit visa . Then , wat is the best thing to do if after a month my sibling can not find a job ?
If ur sibling comes on a tourist visa he can not be looking for a job . If he comes on a visit visa after a month you may apply for an extension for another 5 months . If he is lucky to get a job by then he will require to transfer to company visa -LRB- RP -RRB- If not he will have to exit and come back only after 3 months .
tourist visa can be changed to family visit visa without exiting the country . I got it done for my family just a month ago . Charges are QAR 500 per visa for transfer other than the normal visa charges .

As per the Qatar Immigration `` yes '' . She needs to obtain a work permit since she is dependent and not holding Work Permit . Anyway it is for her employer to process for the Work Permit . Also , many companies do not insist for the work permit for dependents .

She can work anywhere only she has to get NOC letter from you while rest of the formalities might be same . . Ask any mandoob for further details

Currently there is no Bus services to Bahrain , either you rent a bus and start this service . As far as I know Saudi borders are on the way is a major restriction on the way to reach Bahrain .
Not directly , but you can get the Saptco bus from B Ring near Sana to Al Gosaibi Hotel in Al Khobar , and from there get the Saudi-Bahrain Transport bus , or a taxi over the bridge . The Saptco office can probably give you more details .
Thanks a lot Baldrick for your answer . Do you know where the SAPTCO office in Doha is ? What kind of Saudi visa would I need to use this service ?

normal shirt and slacks is fine . . or whatever dress as long it does not show a lot of skin ... its summer here and presently its 48 degrees ...
as she like
short and light . . its too hot nowadays . . whatever matches to her coz nobody stops for any fashion and wears .
Covering one 's knees , bosom and shoulders is always a good idea .
To avoid unwanted attention from others , it is best for your wife to wear clothing that covers her knees and shoulders . Also best to make sure no skin around the waist hips is showing , and no cleavage !
A reminder from your brother . It is always good to wear the dress which God asked us to wear . It can be used every part of the world . So please please try to know what our `` Creator The Lord of Heavens & Earth '' asked us to do . And let us practice it . Then no worries .
whatever she is comfortable but descent . .
Comfortable clothing that is not revealing .
I Love my cultual values but do whatever you and your wife feel good coz u both are forners but its a muslim country so covering your wife according to qatari culture is best thing here just to avoide from others attention otherwise no problem

for family visa required is : 1 - copy of ur wife passport copy 2 - copy of ur marriage contract 3 - bank statmnet 4 - no objection letter from the sponsor 5 - copy of ur emplyment contract . 6 - applecation thats all nothing more im sure 100 % god luck
No . The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs only requires that you give them the house 's electricity and water numbers when applying for a residence visa for your family members ...
That happened with me , they did not charge even the flash lighted . the cameras record vedio as well so they will see that you did not cross the light . Regards .
I heard there is video recording at signals so if they think you are good enough they might not charge you , but you can never say . Incase it comes then try to talk with them asap and you might get lucky .
Hi Thanks everyone In the few months that I have been here I found the driving to be very stressful - more than in Saudi or Bahrain where I lived before.The other day I saw a woman driving a Lincoln SUV as though trying to reach her house on fire .

Being an Indian , I suggest you to get the packages from India . It is flexible & much cheaper . I recently went to Singapore on such a package from there .
Oh My Dayz ! When will you ppl stop ranting and raving and crying to heavens above for the suspicion of booze in Qatar ? This is totally ridiculous !! Well just for the records , Alcohol sales has been suspended only at the Pearl ... that 's just one focking tiny area of the fockin city of Doha aight ? . Other outlets and hotels and still got it on their menu , besides if you just care to walk in to QDC Im sure you can notice the availability of liquor at these stores . I 'm getting very pissed off about the situation here , in the sense that so many expats are just outraged that this one section of the city has had sales suspended !! So they run to Ql to bit-ch about it , as tho if without alcohol , the world would crumbles tomorrow . !!! PFFFF Give it a fockin rest . If you need booze that bad , you have a problem . ! And if living in another culture is so difficult because you may not be able to drink , then you might want to consider just going home to your comfort zone .
wait 'til they are sober , they wo n't understand you ! Lol ! BTW , it 's suspension , not suspicion ! Lol ! no offense , DC ! Hehehehehh !
sunday is a working day here : -RRB-
the OP does n't understand the issue ! Let 's wait for another `` newbee '' to open up a bottle , errr I mean another alcohol-related question ! Lol !
Flor1212 if it 's just `` another newbie alchol-related question '' why are you bothering to post , thank goodness for pros like you who know how to answer questions on forums correctly ... oh no wait . . ; -RRB-
Yup ... Alchohol was only ` suspended ' from sales on the Pearl -LRB- not officially banned -RRB- . Give them around 5 more months and it will return back to full Alchohol sales . This ban reminds me of a 1998 ban on women smoking ` Shisha ' -LRB- Hookah Pipes -RRB- . It was later lifted . Its kind of Qatars way to calm the religious left when they have an incident . I would of thought maybe a religious mans kid came back home drunk and filed a complaint or something ? Just a guess .
@ OP ... you are not in Doha and so out of the loop but still can call a shame for the ban . BTW how did you get thinking that Pearl banned alcohol . And just two words `` Pearl Alcohol '' returned me the two latest threads on the issue and I think irresp
A suspension that will eventually be lifted when sales are down at the restaurants , which all have Qatari investors who wo n't want to watch their profits dwindle .
did you even care to read those threads Bachus ?
United Development Company -LRB- UDC -RRB- , the developer of The Pearl-Qatar , issued a statement announcing the resignation of Khalil Sholy , its managing director and president , on Thusrday , Reuters reports . http:  www.reuters.com article 2012 01 12 idUSL6E8CC3BV20120112
http:  m.arabianbusiness.com qatar-alcohol-ban-could-be-tip-of-iceberg-for-gcc-440454.html Qatars move to ban the sale of alcohol on its flagship Pearl development may hint at the start of a Gulf-wide clampdown on booze sales as governments look to pacify local fears , analysts said . The GCC states may move to rein in sales and tighten alcohol legislation in a bid to walk the line between the expatriate population and their Muslim citizens in the wake of the Arab Spring unrest , said Guy Wilkinson , managing partner at Dubai hospitality consultancy , Viability . Qatar is hardly the first Gulf state in which the local population has expressed its concerns over the sale of alcohol , he told Arabian Business . Following the Arab Spring , I expect Muslim parties to have more and more influence over the control of alcohol throughout the region . The sale of alcohol is strictly monitored in five of the Gulf states with Saudi Arabia operating an outright ban on the sale and consumption of liquor . The move to offer alcohol licenses to outlets and non-Muslims is largely a nod to the regions expatriate workers , who vastly outnumber the local population . But the decision has been met with criticism from some citizens who oppose the sale of liquor in Muslim countries . Qatar retains comparatively tight rules governing alcohol consumption , said Wilkinson . Just a few years back , one could only find it in just a few luxury hotels and clubs with strict entry procedures , he said . The fact that its population has increased so fast over the last few years has evidently not changed the concerns of Muslims over the potential ill effects of alcohol consumption , particularly in terms of moral behaviour . Chiheb Ben Mahmoud , head of Hotel Advisory , for MENA at Jones Lang LaSalle , said the open sale of alcohol was always a delicate balance for Gulf governments . Sometimes , local public opinion is heated up on the back of a combination of factors . It is common for authorities in these cases to act swiftly in order to defuse tension and prevent the issue from heating up further and getting out of control , he said . The suspension of sales on the Pearl could be seen as a wake-up call or a reminder of the invisible red lines not to be crossed .
when it 's already a compromise between the host and the visitors . And surely , the noisy one will keep blah blah blah ! It 's just a choice between `` more money less booze OR less money more booze '' ! Lol ! In Saudi , it 's `` more money and illegal booze '' , and the expats survive there !
qlrules -- I see you are new to QL , so welcome !

yes macavela you right since 1 mount ago the stop thim to sale alchol .

for the encouragement and the kind words . How does your daughter do with the flights ? I 'm a little concerned with my 4 year old , who 's the restless one .
That 's a great question ! We have had a few flights to figure out what to do to keep her occupied and she was 2 and 3 at the time . We got her an iPod and loaded her favorite movies and music onto it . I took coloring books and regular books to read to her . I took a few toys that were small that she liked . We were also in Bus . class so she had a bigger choice in movies and music than her iPod . I also did not fight with her when everyone else was going to sleep . I let her stay awake and watch the movies , then when she was tired , she crashed out and slept for about 5-6 hours . You are going to be exhausted when you get here from trying to stay on top of your kiddo and keeping him her occupied . It was n't all great , we figured all this out over about 4 to 5 flights back and forth to the US . There are still some moments when she was fussy . Hope that helps a bit . Motherhood ... The hardest job you 'll ever love ! : -RRB-
What day are you coming ? I leave the US on the 15th , arrive the 16th . Mandi
good advice ! We 've got the DVD player & books & coloring books & small toys . Keep me in prayer ! Fortunately , my husband will be with us , and my 9 year old 's a big help , too , when he 's not fighting with his little brother . ;--RRB- How old is your daughter now ? Mandi - we arrive 23 July . We 're currently in the process of saying good-bye to all the relations in the East & attending a few family events before we fly out on the 22nd . Did I see on another thread that you attend Epiphany , Mandi ?
Yup , that be me . Church of the Epiphany , DESS . Mandi
Set your clock to Doha time day before your flight . sounds crazy , but that will give you an idea about what to expect when you are already in another time zone . : -RRB-
Melatonin suppose to be good , it will help your body to produce those sleeping hormones and you can get to sleep easier
why would they even have to know ?
ok so next time , do not talk and make yourself sound like a wise guy . Nothing wrong with not knowing . Better not talk than talk and sound retarded . thank you
Code for the engine in a VIN is NOT an engine 's part number ! a 17 digit serial number that identifies a car , will have part of it as an engine identifier ? . . which means that this identifier should be BIG enough to identify all engines produced for that car which are WAY MORE than the car productions of that model ! Do you guys think before you type ? Like seriously . . why not just say NOTHING instead of sounding like a butt-head ? Man Not one man in Doha can know if you change your engine . http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Vehicle_Identification_Number
hi mojo , I dont think the traffic department will charge you for changing your engine except you need to have keep a receipt from where you will buy the engine for future police check or at the annual technical inspection .
The VIN decodes the `` engine type '' . In the case of my car it identifies the engine type as : 4.7 L V8 SOHC 16V If you change it to a V-6 engine , the code will be wrong !

OK and I can get your triple your money inside of 5 seconds . There is no cure for type 1 diabetes , type 2 diabetes can be controlled -LRB- to a certain extent -RRB- by diet and honey is n't on the list . Signature line > `` You ca n't fix stupid ''
Yes , there are many bees in the Gulf . They are smaller than the honey bees I 'm familiar with in North America and not very aggressive . They build beautiful honeycombs in trees that have lots of foliage to protect them from the sun . They are also highly prized by locals as local honey is considered the `` best '' . Signature line > `` You ca n't fix stupid ''
Agree with you Fubar
Honey , in general , combined with cinnamon helps with many kinds of diseases . I personally use this combo for clearer skin and to battle fatigue . This really boosts my energy level , so I exercise longer and it also decreases my appetite . I have also read that if honey is taken in the right dosage , it does not harm diabetic patients .
Honey can really change the workings of the pancreas ... ... ... NOT ! XXX ________________________________________________ Man makes plans ... ... ... God smiles ; - -RRB-
PCG do you mean Honey can change the workings of the pancakes ?

How you eat without evidences honey that has calories sugar and that is what one has to avoid during dibetes
your all nice and good.im very very thankful to all.goodluck and goodhealth to all of you .

Ask your friends here to get tourist visit visa issued for you .
THanku for the help also wanted to ask where can i stay alone as i have heard i cant stay with guy friends , so where and how can i stay .
You want to get the visa yourself , you would need to contact Qatar Embassy in your country . No idea about the requirements though .
house . She stays alone . But I 'll have to ascertain that you are safe .
we must know your nationality , secondly , your MALE FRIENDS never get a visit visa for you as only Husband , father , brother or any blood relation can apply for a visit visa , QATAR is a safe place if you have self confidence . You can not stay with male in a hotel or any apartment unless you prove that he is your brother , father or husband .
loads and loads of hotels here to stay ... and tons of flats , houses , villas are empty : -RRB-
u can get tourist visa by your own but it will cost you so much , so if you have friends here in doha ask them to get visa for you from some agency such as cleaopatra or fahad . regarding job issue you can get job easily in doha and that depend on your experience but you have one strong point with you and that is you are FM and it easy for FM to get job here in doha . for accomodation you can ask your friend to find bed space for you till you will not get job so in this way you will be not spending so much for your accomodation . doha is safe place for everyone comparing to another GCC countries , but still you have to be carefull from bad peoples and they are everywhere in all countries . good luck and hope you will enjoy in doha .
what about black suit italian style loool
First date ? Appear to be really shy ... wear nothing .
i think so a black suit
If I wear my birthday suit she may think I have 3 legs ?
go with the natural dress
Be simple , wear Jeans and shirt . . look cool ... Be happy and make happy ...
Wear what ever you are comfortable in .
Its always good to overdress rather than under dress in any occasion . Looking at the occasion dress smart casual depends where is the date though -LRB- May not suit a candle light dinner -RRB- . Act cool and act u never thought of what to dress at the date .
Since you 're Scottish , wear your national dress . She will want to know what 's underneath .
My ex-pat and Qatari brothers and siters you answer my question for me and now I am not nervous ! If we head for the bedroom should I take my lap-top with me so you can answer any more questions I may have

Yep you need a letter from your sponsor for registering it in your name at the traffic department .
You have to take the letter , signed by your core sponsor which is mentioned on your ID card ... take Photo copy of his ID also ... to get rid from Multi-rounds ... T.C
Yes you are in Slave Country , man . If you want to marry , you also need a NOC from your sponsor , imagine .

Well pitstop I do n't mean to offend you or the chef . I am sure there has to be more then one person working on the sushi . Maybe I just got the wrong one . Novita I will try la cigele 's . And curious if anyone has tried sakura 's yet at the ramada ? Please pass the number of your friend .
As I mentioned above maybe I was expecting sth different . All I know about Japanese culture was from movies . And if you do not try to make a lil search and try to know about a new culture - like me - , you can feel disappointment sometimes . For example I am feeling admire for Japanese people because they are almost the leader of Robotic technology , and for electronics they are also on the tops . But sometimes when I experience that it is very hard for some people to understand sth simple you are disappointed . In any case I admire Japanese people because they could build a strong and developed country after such a massive destruction at WWII while keeping their own traditions . And if we return to our original theme I love Sushi too . Am glad that they are so good at it ; -RRB-
Default Nick : Do n't worry about it . We are all not how we expect ourselves to be . I hope that made sense . And about learning different cultures , I lived in Japan for 9 years , so I know what you are talking about . Back to Sushi , anyone want a free go at Oishi Sushi :P ??
pitstop ! Yes pls :P
Pitstop , i was joking :-RRB- I can afford the sushi lol . Dont mind to have a sushi blind date sometimes with you though :-RRB- Only heard about you but never meet before ...
hv anyone tried sushi in La Cigale Sushi 's bar ... i been 3 times so far and very happy with it . It is pricey but to us worth the money . And i also have a japanese friend who does home made sushi ... few mths ago it is cost 150 QR for 3 tier containers and it was good . You have to pick the food from her place then have to return the container to her . If anyone want her number do drop me a PM .
novita77 : La Cigale Sushi bar was good , but I 've had better . Seriously thing that Moon Palace had the best Sushi , but it is all a matter of personal preference .
novita77 : They open from 11 am to 11 pm - I think . You should try their Sushi , it is n't as bad as some people say it is . We ordered out from there and we at it all . Yum Yum . .
LOL KellysHeroes !!
thank you pitstop ... will defenitely do that :-RRB-
novita77 : You are more than welcome :-RRB- Let me know what you think after your experience .
Oishi Sushi in the Royal Plaza is the best in Qatar so far . Try the private rooms !
Moon Palace has decent sushi , also the Korean Garden place at Ramada signal towards Al Sadd . ummm ... i feel this sudden urge to satisfy the gastronomic activities of my stomachic cavity !!!
I say Oishi Sushi is the best because they have a real Japanese chef . The private rooms are cool , too .
He is Korean same as the Sakura Guy of Ramada :-RRB- Ban Spoon Feeding not Me
tara_thesouther : Oishi Sushi 's chef is a Japanese and I can personally introduce him to you whenever you want . Feedback , negative or positive , is always good . Thank You !
We are working with so many Japanese people here . And honestly I am a lil bit disappointed : -RRB- Maybe I am affected so much from Samurai things and was in great expectations . `` What does n't kill me ; makes me stronger ... ''
Go to Le Cigale Hotel , it has a really good sushi bar .
I have yet to try Sakura in Ramada this wednesday ! The internet is our revenge machine
koorean and japanese garden neo
they are good but i like neo more its next to layali and nando 's resto
Moon Palace and Oishi Sushi
pitstop , that would be nice .
Agree with Novita . `` What does n't kill me ; makes me stronger ... ''
I just wanted to give some feedback for people who are interested . I tried sushi minto last Thursday . The atmosphere and the service was also good . They have a variety from sushi to some fast food . My friend tried Salmon and he said it was nice too . For the rest I will continue to give further info . Peace `` What does n't kill me ; makes me stronger ... ''

Well , I have n't taken the blood test yet as I 'm moving out there in a couple weeks but from what my employer told me the test is checking for Hepatitus and HIV . You are also tested for Tuberculosis . I do n't think Herpes is on the list but someone else might know better . Good luck !
No , just Hep B and C and HIV . You 'll be fine .
Yes , the blood test is for HIV and Hepatitis , and the X-ray is for tuberculosis . The blood test is also to determine your blood type .
derangement in the blood that associated with all sort of ailments
Well , It 's just to check what highly contagious diseases you may have .
er , you mean a bribe ? Well I 'm sure if you get caught doing that the 2 year ban will be replaced with 2 years in jail .
He was asking about a fee o lift to BAN legally.Its a legal procedure in Dubai to lift ban . not bribe . .
read properly first QDCL ... .
That 's interesting . So laws can be bought and sold in Dubai . If I commit murder in Dubai can I pay a fee to the police to have it waived ?
lol QDCL
Dear QDCL ... whatever , If you know about the topic comment here , othere wise enjoy ur weekend .
there are instances that you can get back within short span of time here in doha , stated in the law also , that when you are cleared and given eit visa you can not come bck to doha until 2 yrs but in cases , there are some companies giving to their employees whom dont have any trouble made or clean and neat in the workplace , no problems give to the company ; have given the visa exit clearances only and can come bakc any time since this is EXIT CLEARANCE not CANCELLATION of working visa ; by the time you go home already the validity of your pataqa will be counted for ; If you have reached the expiration of your pataqa and did not come back as soon as possible then the company ca declare null & void and this will be worked out by the mandoob for automatic cancellation of your working visa ... .
in addition , it is also clear stated by the labor law of qatar that once you been cancelled , the working visa is still on working condition but the company whom you have worked for will give you RE-ENTRY VISA for going back here and work with the same company otherwise automatic discharges of the working permt on the side of the company and no more excuses but you will get back after 2 yrs .

It would help if we knew what type of car you had . . Due to its uprated engine , my pink KIA is serviced by a specialist who flies in when required .
I took mine to a cliff , released the hand brake and jumped out
Yes . He 's batty , works in the dark , but is a great mechanic .
Just ignore the mileage .
i hope 1 day i can see your pink kia ... Becos werever ther is a question regarding car , u reply about ur pink
Perhaps the easiest way would be to go to the Mitsubishi dealer and have a full check carried out .
Replace the timing belt of the engine , it should cost you around 600 ~ 1000 QR including labour .
If your tran is auto then yes , if not do n't bother .

yes , It 's really been so hard for me to decide but I really need also to be with my mom , but the problem is I am the bread winner which makes me break my heart into pieces knowing that my mom is suffering from this kind of illness without me at her side .
what 's the name I am going to look to ?
they said that the patient should be here in Doha so that they can make an actions . but unfortunately my mom ca n't travel anymore . = -LRB-
Dear Kasheem , If Im in your situation I will go back to my back home.I know you are the bread winner.But since your mother cant travell and she cant come to Doha.So you have to go.otherthan suffering.because every single minute you will feel you are living hell.and your mother also happy when you are her side.I know money is main problem.Ask some help people around you.If I have money I will give you.But Im jobless.So ask for help.may be you feel its stupid idea.But I will do same if I were you.asking money is difficult.But in this world most presious one is your mom.So go back.other than suffering .
thanks and your comments is really so true but my big problem is I do n't have money to use , and I do n't know where to ask . It 's really so bad that I cant do anything to go back home and be with my mom , my mom missing me a lot and I miss her also . It is already more than a year that I am here in Doha and away from my mother . I love my mom so much because she is the only one who raised us , she is single parent my dad left us when I was just 5 years old . and I know how hard it is being single parent raising 3 kids . and now cant even do anything to be with her side . = -LRB-
Sad to hear that . you may approch Qatar Charity and Qatar red cresent , may they will help

Kia is a good car , i am using a 2008 kia optima and it hasnt given me any trouble so far . all i had to change were the break pads battery , glass wiper and the headlight bulb which are very normal accesories to change in any car . the parts are very cheap . if i recollect i hardly spent less than 500 riyals for the break pads and the glass wiper . the parts are easily available at the kia service centre in industrial area . The pick up is good and the ac is excellent . You should consider buying a KIA ,
http:  www.thecarconnection.com overview kia_rio_2013
There is another CON that can be resolved with little or no skill . The cabin AC filters are too small and they easily get stacked with this dusty weather , usually my commute is from very short distances so in 2 years mine is just 13,000 kms meaning that I do n't do much service in it , one thing I learned is to replace the cabin AC filter kits for maximum efficiency . The kit would cost from 50 to 100 QAR and it only takes 10 minutes to replace it .
BTW , my first car in Doha was a 2007 Kia Sorento . I bought this car second hand from a British couple . We still have it and my wife is driving it . I 've done some offroad at the inland sea and let me tell you , I was shocked with the performance . Our most recent trip was with two friends , both driving their LC Prado -LRB- V6 version -RRB- and they could not believe what this Sorento was capable of doing . Kia is probably the most underrated brand . As I said , service is my main concern , other than that it 's great for the money .
` Cos Kia give a 7 year warranty on new cars sold in UK . Clearly they have faith in their reliability . I 've driven a Kia Sportage and it 's OK . Good value for money .
Thank QL for giving me these comments and suggestion . How about Hyundai . I think KIA AND HYUNDAI ARE NOW SEPERATE COMPANY . Any comments on this brand and how they perform on the road . Is it cheaper than KIA ? how about it maitenance and parts cost ?
Kia is a good car ... Sportage is quite good ... but not the latest model : -LRB-
favoritetrick , Hyundai is also pretty good - can not comment on their service since it 's run by a different group in Qatar . Be aware that Kia and Hyundai are very similar in specs and spare parts . I 've seen many spare part boxes branded as Kia Hyundai .
Its a nice enough car but underpowered particularly in low gears as you start to accelerate - youve really got to `` floor it '' .
You have to visit KIA SR to obtain more information or check the review of the car to http:  www.thecarconnection.com overview kia_rio_2012 For more info please send your queries to jesnetkia@gmail.com or 55107890
parts and maintenance is cheap but performance is cheap too . . better to buy a toyota coz the kia rates are close to toyota too in some models .
Thank you very much for this information . i guess i have to think twice before buying this RIO because i red negative review about this car and just want to know from those who have the experienced using this
dont make a silly mistake , go for Nissan Tiida
I have a Kio Rio Hatchback since 2005 and absolutely maintenance free so far.Yes the pickup is slow but its a pleasure driving it . Go for it .
Kia overall has the best prices on the market , compared to most brands in Qatar . Their quality is comparable to these ` top ' japanese brands like Toyota , Honda or Nissan . Now , Chairboy has brought a valid point - the Kia Rio version that is being sold in Qatar is a little bit underpowered . I own a 2010 Rio and besides this , I have no complains about the car . I just I could own a manual version but for security reasons is always better to have automatic shift so other members of the family could drive it . The pluses are : price and quality and the newer models are much nicer and better looking than its predecessors . The big NO ! particularly in Qatar : the quality of service . Unfortunately they only have ONE service center in this country , which is located in the industrial area . In many cases they could take up to two days just for an oil change ... last time the car was seldom washed and they did not vacuum it inside . There is a big rumour that they will be opening a new service center near the old airport area , unless this is true I would not consider buying a new Kia but if they do , I would give it a go .
They 're similar - the last time I surveyed , Kia was slightly lower . Just to give you an idea : Rio = Accent Elantra = Optima Sportage = Tucson Sorento = Santa Fe etc. . . etc. . .
The best thing you to do is to visit all your prospect brand , do a test drive and so on ... KIA RIO -LRB- Accent , Aveo , Sunny , Yaris , Honda City , Lancer -RRB- Here in Qatar KIA they are giving 5 yrs warranty or 100000 kms . Cheers !!
No , because she has no boobies !

I think only if your Business Visa was extended past the initial 30 days .
wot ever the visa u com for , once to enter qatar and if u want to go out u need Khurooj -LRB- exit permit -RRB- u can take it online with ur sponsors authority .
Yes . Exit permit is required if you stayed more than 15 days inside Qatar .
You do not require exit permit once you come into the country on Business visa . Please , for all those who have answered to this question , you need to do your homework . I work in the HR and this is one of my core jobs to arrange visas for incoming candidates for the past 2.5 years .
Dear carpediem , I guess your employer will kick your a ** soon . If business visa is extended for more than 30days in Qatar then you must obtain an exit permit to leave the country .
thanks to all
thanks to all
yes , in my house . :-RRB- i think not much people will understand your thread . why not yum seng ? : p

and also , what is the min investment capital i need to start up a company in Qatar ?
Hi AJ , I work for a British managed company that specializes in partnering with companies coming to Qatar . The most common form of business setup in Qatar is a Limited Liability Company . To incorporate that company you 'll require ; - Share capital of a Qrs200 ,000 . - Your Qatari partner must have at least 51 % ownership . - The profit share of the partners does not have to match the shareholding of the partners . Our company is in a position to act as your local partner . This is the basics , if you 'd like to know more , please feel free to PM me for more information . Best regards , James
thanks for the info . i was just reading online about the new law that came out , it says that if your in the ICT sector then you can actully own 100 % of the company is that true ? Regards ,
Ok , the answer to that is , yes and no ! It 's true this ` law ' was announced about 18 months ago . As with many things here , in reality it 's not quite as straight forward as it would seem . Yes , theoretically an IT company can be under 100 % foreign ownership , however , in practice it seems most of the companies involved are large international companies who have been ` invited ' to come to Qatar by HRH . It 's an expensive route to take , and frankly there 's little chance of approval . We would be happy to go down this road on your behalf and make the application , though it wo n't be cheap with an extremely minimal chance of success ! Any other info , let me know .
me and my friend are looking froward to start bussiness here in doha ... so we can be ur partners . . if ur intersting plz email me . . muss44@hotmail.com

R U looking for any body or people ? frist decide ... then post ... .
No , yesterday they all gone to MARS to watch Miss Universe !
why you do n't like any `` body '' else from your country ... ? actually your Chiru and Nagu dadas were here last week ... they were cuaght and deported as illegal immigrants . People some the same country , but racist behaviour against each other . . grow up ... Stop this .
There is no medical test . But they will ask for a doctor 's statement giving the infant 's blood type -LRB- for the medical cards -RRB- and it 's also worth bringing immunization records .
We need to take the infant to Medical Commission as well or I can go myself with all documents and pay the QAR 100 ? Other thing , blood group mention on immunization card -LRB- from Pakistan -RRB- is OK or I have to take blood group report again from any laboratory from Qatar ? Thank you .
No blood test is required for child upto age of 16yrs . No need to take your child to medical commision.QR 100 is fees for stamping by medical comission on your documents.Mother of the child must be needing medical tests.Better give child 's paper with her while sending her in female section as work will get faster there . Original visa alongwith copy mentioning your mobile no. , original passport + copy , PP photo , Sponser 's -LRB- Father -RRB- RP-THESE ARE REQUIRED.NOTHING ELSE !

The Best one u can go for is the one available at National Show room that is the Panasonic Brand ... . u will never have any regrets ...
Hi , As mentioned before , Panasonic , beur , omron , Braun etc are good machines ... u can get from any pharmacies . . But try to get one that measures at the upper arm and not the wrist , as the upper arm ones are supposed to be more accurate ...
GO FOR BRAND NAME `` OMRON '' LOCAL AGENT IBN ALHYTEM MEDICAL CO
check the panasonic showroom they have a good brand also .
Almost all pharmacies have different brands and type of blood pressure monitor .
Your Residence permit is expired . It means you do NOT have any residence permit . The grace period is given to finalize your matters in Qatar in case you did n't have enough time , and to leave the country . Grace period does n't mean you have a valid RP . And since you do not have an RP , WHAT the he 'll are you going to transfer ? You have to renew your RP with your current sponsor , after that you can transfer your RP .
. . and how many days can one stay if the visa is cancelled .
i think if your sponsor give you NOC then you have to pay the palenty of Qr 200 per day and you can proceed , but it is better that you should consult some legel advisor ,
The question is : How legal is to do the new visa with a new company AFTER the expiry of the present visa without leaving Qatar ? My present sponsor 's agreed to give me NOC . He is frightning me that Immigration will not do the new visa for me as the old one wil be expired .
if you have submitted your case for sponsorship changing before expiry and when your case of changing is in processing and your visa expire then it is okand you have to pay only fine.i think fine is Qr 200
Average , but not good .
If accommodation , child 's education and transport is covered outside 13500 QAR , I would say it is a good offer . Still depends upon your qualification and experience and how much you are earning back home .
You do one thing . . Try to compare your offered package with the one that you are getting in your present working firm . . If you think that you can do much better in DOHA with the OFFERED salary , accept the offer then . .
Thank you for the advice you 're so kind , I think that i 'll accept this offer hoping that my wife will find a new job in DOHA -LRB- teacher at the university -RRB-
It is a good offer with a saving potential of 8000 QR per month . if u are an average spender .
You can give those to me as i 'm interested ok

Why worry about the -LRB- working -RRB- visa when you have n't applied for a job -LRB- In Qatar -RRB- yet ? I find this like : farmer counting the eggs but the layer hen is still in the market waiting to be bought purchased and the chicken coop has n't been built yet ...

thanks but after getting the job how long does it takes to get the visa
Depends upon the availability of visa of your Nationality assigned to your company . If every thing is in order , it can be issued with in weeks . But it may take even up to 2-3 months for your company to get one issued . So have patience .
Cinque terre in Italy . Dordogne in France . Switzerland . You should get great deals this year due to the recession .
thank you moma , do you recommend any specific location in Switzerland ?
Try centreparcs . They are perfect for a family vacation and have `` villages '' in several European countries . My husband and son had a great time at centreparcs `` Bispinger Heide '' in Germany . http:  www.centerparcs.com EN GB home
Hi , You could try the Lake District in the UK , I have found the best places are Coniston , Kendal and Windermere . I used to go with my wife and kids at least three times a year . Weather should be ok that time of year , and it is fantastic for walks , and very safe for children . If you hired a car you could drive round the different villages and stay in a different B&B or Guest House every night if you wanted , so there would be plenty of variety .
Go to Austria . It is slightly cheaper than the rest of Europe . It has a beautiful landscape and has loads of historic architecture . The Vienna zoo is one of the best zoos in the world . Also , their museums of arts , natural history and science are amazing .

thanks for the advice guys . i think its better for me to take the police report . one more question . since i have third party insurance , i dont think i will get reimbursement , is that right ? what is the third party insurance rules here for hit and run where we cant see the car who hit ???
you can go to street 11 in industrial aria you will find the garage
You need a police report .
POLICE REPORT for a scratch done my oneself ??? even i wan na know why to go police if no other vehicle has hit his car ?? . . Sorry for my ignorance but i really wan na know if neone could answer . . thnx
Hi Soniya , good question . the only reason i can think of it is that the garage guys might not believe in my version of the story . anyways , if you can help , please do : -RRB-
ok . . thnx for ur explanation . . I ca n't help u buddy , sorry . .
Soniyaji , it is prevailing traffic rules in Qatar , if it is slightly scratched or damaged while reversing , parking etc. , still it is better to go to traffic and show them , get a clearance paper , then go to insurance with their specified garages to get it repaired . There by you are safe at the time of Istimara passing your car annually .
With out a police report , garage guys will not agree to repair ur car . U need to go to ploce station & should pay 112 riyals to get the letter .
If a car damages , no matter it is your own fault or by someone else 's ... A police report is a must in either case It 's a rule here .

commission depends ; if you are paying already enough rent the agents cover it from landlord side otherwise 15day rent for them is enough , . the best way is to set your priorities budget , area and alternate choices and then roam around looking for banners `` For Rent '' , plus check daily ads in news papers , online ads , ask for references in your family friends . . i believe over 60 % accomodation are not properly advertised and just street search , word of mouth and building caretakers support normally get you a nice apartment of your choice my 2 cents good luck
depends upon u what u want compact suvs - rav4 , suzuki vitara , hyundai tucson or large - toyota landcruiser , nissan patrol , pathfinder , pajero and the list goes on and on ... ... . .
i would prefer pajero or LC
CRV or Pilot .
brand new or used ?
any will do , minimum requirements ; - V6 - can do dune bashing - 1995 Model is alright . The cheapest I need . Any recommendation ?
CRV or Pilot . Pilot is really bad in Desert I used it ...
u want to buy a car in cheep price ? i have Nissan Maxi ma 98 model price 9000 u can contact me thanks
yeah . . Nissan Patrol or LC is a good choice for Dunes Bashing . Nissan Patrol will be much cheaper compared to LC . . if u looking for 95 model . . it shouldnt be expensive . try searching in QL Classifieds .
let Mitsubishi your last option bro . . it is well designed and well shaped . . but will not last as long as Toyota , Nissan and Honda . . just wan na mention that , good luck

aside from tutorials , you can help him by watching english tv shows listening to english songs only while you are in your house and the child is also watching listening -LRB- be aware of obscene words though -RRB- . a child 's mind is like a sponge , it can absorb easily and promptly and though he could not understand the words at first , they will not be so foreign-sounding to him at least . another way is to read bedtime stories to him in english . kadaut ...
Yes I do agree with arecel ... bring some comic books and some children movies for him it 's the best way for learning English .
rp , what is exactly his problem ? is it spelling ? reading and writing ? if it 's spelling , let him read and read and play backgammon , scrabbles or anything that would allow him to read the words . it will be easy to remember the spellings this way . same strategy for reading problem . if it is writing per se , teach him how to write the alphabets first then gradually introduce him to simple words . kadaut ...

That Tom Cruise daughters name . . The Los Angeles Times summarized the written statement Cruise released on the birth as saying the name `` is a word with origins in both Hebrew and Persian . In Hebrew , it means ` princess ' and in Persian , ` red rose , ' it was claimed in the release . '' -LSB- 19 -RSB- However , magazines and blogs noted on Cruise 's mistranslation on Suri 's Hebrew meaning . -LSB- 20 -RSB- In Hebrew , Suri actually means `` from Syria '' , not `` princess '' . -LSB- 21 -RSB- -LSB- 22 -RSB- The wrong etymology might stem from the fact that Suri is a Yiddish pet form of Sarah , which means `` princess '' . -LSB- 23 -RSB- Curiously , in Japanese ` suri ' can mean `` pickpocket . '' -LSB- 24 -RSB- In Korean , ` suri ' is a conjugation of the verb ` to repair ' -LRB- mechanical devices -RRB- .
both you and your husband each come up with 5 girl names and 5 boy names . that 's if you do n't know the gender yet . I suggest names with family cultural meaning . Then each of you get to strike 2 girl boy names off of each other lists -- no explanations . then try to whittle it down from there . use compromise . for my 2nd son , my husband picked out a name right off the bat . I thought it was so so , but 9 months later I had n't thought of any that I was crazy about and since my husband LOVED the name he picked out , I decided that it really must matter to him and so we went with the name he liked . This should be a fun experience !

Another comment -- why worry about it so much yet ? For all of my 5 children we went to the hospital with a list of names , then when the child was born and we met him her and discovered their personality , we went with the name that seemed to fit them best . Sometimes just seeing your baby will help you to instantly decide what their name should be . It 's almost as if they tell you themselves what they want to be named .

sponsorship from company to husband is NOC -LRB- No objection Certificate -RRB- . if they refused to give you then there is no way for the transfer . And if the visa was cancelled the only way is for the wife to go back home and wait for her family visa sponsored by the husband .
thank you tatess on the responsed , so if the visa is to cancel by the company sponsor , is the wife be BANNED from entering Doha for 2 years ? or she can return back immediately once the husband applied for family visa . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = `` liFe wAs lIkE a bOx oF cHocOlAtEs . yOu nEveR kNow wHaT yOu 'Re gOn Na gEt .

yes ! they will not let you out of the country before you paying the fines .
Yes , else you will be barred from leaving the country
I always settled traffic violations during registration and never had problem leaving country being frequent flyer ... How ?
You will only have to pay the violations before travelling if the fines are registered to your Qatar ID . So for a speeding fine that a radar caught you doing will be registered to the vehicle and not your ID in which case you will be fine . If you got stopped at a roundabout for not wearing a seatbelt and the police man asked for your license , then the fine would regisetred against your ID , in which case you would have to pay the fine before travelling .
it is only mandatory if you resigned and leaving qatar for good ... but for frequent flyer not necessary .
Qatars Department of Traffic and Patrol Police has said motorists who have outstanding fines will not be allowed to leave the country once a new law comes into force this week , reported the Peninsula . Potential violators can access the Ministry of Interiors website from October 2 to check for any possible fines . Meanwhile fines will increase at a rate of QR1 per day if they are not paid within 60 days . via : ameinfo

Who say 's its illegal ? Dont make up stories . And if it illegal get some authentic proof to justify your statement or else take a walk !

if your pc got infected by a torjan virus that means whatever anti virus your using right now just didnt do the job well , no software is going to be 100 % sure to remove the virus . why dont u want to format it ?

My advice is that a pc needs a good formatting atleast after 6 months , gets rid of all the junk that gets collected and runs must better : -RRB-
<b> use AVG antivirus and try PC tools spyware
Totally agree with Smoke . unless you fromat your pc you cant remove 100 % Virus with any tools or software .
I have tried using different kinds of antivirus but based on my experience , NOD32 is the best , you can download a free trial of NOD32 , it works 100 % and there will be a lot of infiltrations in you PC that will be scanned and removed , just try it .
I suggest you try the 2009 Symantec Internet Security V16 , its the best ever till now ... give it a shot
thnx guys for all your answers . . Tcom i tryed the one u suggested after scaning it detected 98 infected files i removed them all ... ... . hopefully it should be ok now .
i suggest you try Kaspersky A V ...
try this it really works ... http:  www.pctools.com spyware-doctor-antivirus ...and here is the serial Name : Matz olsson Password :0 JTZXG-FA0RN3-V9KXG9 - 1JAXKW-C8U31B-6DGGCK
emn , check here : http:  remove-trojan-virus.com  Hope it works !! Regards !!
Its depends . How severely your computer has been infected ? Try to remove first by Trojan Remover V6 .7 . Probably your anti-virus will wont work . After you slightly remove by TRv6 .7 try installing Kaspersky . It is the best in the market now . Unless you need a clean format to your PC .
trojan remover is not that good enough . . download latest version of combofix , disable your antivirus software and run this one after scanning turn on you antivirus update it and run a deep scan . . then run a disk clean-up and registry scanner . . last thing keep away from p _ r _ o sites lols . . hope it helps

When one becomes narrow-minded and they easily got offended with it . Sometimes the illogical part of the religious faith -LRB- which seems to not adapt with the modern times -RRB- tends to rise up as being legit and plenty of people who stays in a country bounded by that certain religion has no choice but to make it look respectable -LRB- There really is a difference between `` Respect '' and `` Making it look respectable '' -RRB- to keep their adaptive -LRB- ` corruptive ' is too direct a term -RRB- freedom in bay . My explanations also work on other religions . We used to ` nitpick ' the Jewish -LRB- and even Israel -RRB- on the other side of the continent for the matter . Some nitpicks are not nitpicks , but a reflection of the reality -LRB- if I do n't see it everyday , I never would 've known the common obvious -RRB- ... and some people just ca n't accept that , hence they perceive it as a nitpick . `` Everything in this book may be wrong . '' Illusions : The Adventures of The Reluctant Messiah by Richard Bach
Thejam , well said lucid points , herein lies the confusion . Pitstop , why do you think it should be banned , how else can you explain the religon to many who want to know or debate , besides is n't that a muslims duty to not shy from discussions regarding his her deen , but to address and explain and debate ? Qatarexplorer , you also made valid points . Yes , some debaters obviously appear to pose as muslims yet clearly are pregiduce . Do n't you think that perhaps the debaters you mentioned do n't actually hate Islam ? People often attack and fear what they do n't understand , its humans psychology . I 'd like to believe that a great majority , regardless of their negative comments , are actually drawn to Islam because there is something undoubtedly real and logical about this religon and they may actually be searching or yearning for answers . I only wish that some muslims would debate responsibly knowing that they are at that very moment representing Islam in these peoples eyes and therefore bear the responsibility of tolerance , patients & respect when we are faced with not so civilised debates because ALdeen al akhlaq -LRB- religon is manners -RRB- This reminds me of when the prophet Mohammed pbuh was driven out of Altayef with stones thrown at him because they refused his message , then God sent him the Angels -LRB- of Wind and Mountains -RRB- and asked do you want vengence ? To this the Prophet pbuh replied -LRB- I cant quote accurately but the general jist of the response was -RRB- ` They know not and perhaps one day good will come from this people '
islam is the best .

because Qatar is an Islamic country and the most people here are Muslims , I would think , do n't you ?! we are talking about Qatar living here , so living here is about Islam for most of us , I may be wrong : -RRB-
were majority of people living here are muslim ... and we are in Doha - Qatar ... I 'm sure if we are in Philippines we will talk about being christians or even catholics for that matter ...

because of the inferiority complex in some of the `` Muslim '' QL posters ...
respect ramadan!coz this kind of thread turns on bashing religion for those QLers have the spoil mind ... note :
Because many people have a bee in their bonnet regarding Islam . Also , because some Muslims portray a holier than thou attitude .
With the number of foreigners , perhaps the non Muslims outnumber the Muslims . .
because Islam is getting divided in two ... ... The real Islam and the Islam of the mullas . Aana free , jaana free , Pakde gaye tho khana free .
MD , the more you play football , the more you would want to join the team . Thats the problem
Stone Cold , the more you `` play '' the less time you will have for useless talking !
Thats right . Relativity counts here rather than beating around the bush leading to no where .
I think qatari and ahmad should ban religious topics .
<P> YES . YOU CAN APPLY FOR THE LICENCE . HOWEVER THE VALIDITY OF YOUR LICENCE WILL BE EXPIRED ALONG WITH YOUR VIST VISA VALIDITY . < P>
That is but obvious bijoy ... Anyway two contradictory opinions , I guess I 'll have to goto Muroor and ask myself , thanks for all the help though
Without a valid driving license from your home country you can not apply for a Qatari driving license .

exit permit is valid for 1 week from issuance . .
There are two types of exit permit . The type good for one use , which expires if not used and and unlimited exit permit which is good for one year . You should ask for the unlimited kind , if your sponsor is amenable , which will avoid the hassle of having to get one each time you leave the country -LRB- there is also a fee charged for the unlimited type -RRB- , but do n't be surprised if your sponsor refuses . There is no penalty for failing to use either type of exit permit .
Definatley not a problem , but a very good question that may answer a lot of people that maybe in the same situation in the future
a follow up question ... is it possible to get again ur exit permit from your sponsor or still valid ? how many days do exit permit valid ?
http:  www.emirates.com english plan_book essential_information visa_passport_information uae_visas.aspx Sometimes public forums do not portrait a direct and straight forward answer but instead each and everyone 's experience . Try contacting either Emirates or Etihad and ask them . Your last resource would be approaching the UAE embassy 's consular service and ask for guidelines . Regards !!
YES YOU can , but you have to pay for insurance with emirates nbd counter on dxb before proceeding to immigration counter , they will give you 30 days for you but no idea about your family !!!
thanks galloper and Syria man - for your quick response
As posted by galloper check with the Airlines as they will be the one allowing you to board the flight . If they dont allow you to board how will you reach the counter in Dubai .
Please call Airline in which you are flyin
You inquire via email through amer@dnrd.ae . Send them a scanned copy of your Qatar ID and they will tell you if you are eligible for visa on arrival . Sometimes the airlines will tell you that your occupation is not under the list and they might ask you to sign a waiver that if you are not allowed in to Dubai you will have to shoulder your return and penalty .
ur self yes but family im not sure
Hello Guys , I am Indian National having a RP of Qatar from last more 7 months with Visa Designation as `` General Consultant '' and wish to visit Dubai for 4 Nights and 5 Days . Am i eligible for On Arrival Visa ? My Wife is on my Dependent Visa so will she be also eligible for on arrival ? If not then can i apply online and through which website ? Thank you in advance .

Excellent info mate . . Many thanks . Ram
It depends on what type of cloths and entertainment you want . For entertainment there is not much to do besides going to the shopping malls or restaurants . You will find everything , from very high end clothing -LRB- Gucci , D&G , etc. -RRB- to GAP , Banana Republic and department stores . No deals like outlet malls in the US . Regarding restaurants , depend where you want to dine : Ritz Carlton , Four Seasons , TGI Fridays , etc. . Expect prices to be the same to , for example , Boston .
Entertainment is a vast area . . lem me know what u mean by it !

observe QL !
so far egyption army is trying their best to overcome the situation , mubarak says he wont leave before september which indicates things would be settled down till then !! so can be said army plays a vital role in situations like these !!
I thought about it long and hard ... I think its not even the people in general ... but specifically `` YOU '' . One Person . Thats it .
I think thats what Kennedy meant ... when he said `` ask what you can do for your country ''
even israel does n't want mubarak to go , he is the one tying israelies with rest of the arab world in peace process !

Yeah ... Expatgeezer ... NAfrica ... ok lol Let me give some example say from India ... its the Entrepreneurs ... people like Ratan Tata , Narayana Murthy of Infosys , Dhirubhai Ambani of Reliance , Azim Premji of Wipro , Vijay Mallya of Kingfisher . What India is today is mainly because of them ... these guys have been able to push beyond the ordinary ... seek excellence . In US say Bill Gates , and Steve Jobs started the Computer Revolution that sent its ripples around the whole world ... changed the way how people work ... do business ... make friends ... and even write .
no need for arguing just pray and promote peace !
Do n't most people get paid once a month ? Mandi
I dont think so company will pay you for 15days :-O ... wat does your termination clause says ?? read tat and decide ... Good luck
yes , Resignation Reqired if you want to get your salary for 15 day and go back or find another job
Why ??
not yet . no medical , no fingerprints . no contract . i just started last may 23 . just an offer letter he gave me . but then what if they didnt gave my salary ? tnx for the replies .
why do you want to resign
management problem .
think twice b4 resigning u might end up not finding a new job quick
yes . but i want to know if my employers can defer my 15 days salary . can i demand them ?
I doubt !!!!
No , it only means more profit .
You are so funny , do you think a monoply business cares about you ? Unless you want to fly via another hub continue to pay more and more .
Mimiloves2sing . I think you will find that 's the Airbus A380 which Qatar does n't have yet ... unless the economy class on the 787 is actually the cargo hold !!!
did u see the inside ? amazing and of course premium upstairs level like a 5 * hotel . for sure going to be for the elite , emirates has them now . I know I wont be able to afford to throw money away like this . http:  www.youtube.com watch?v=R_Ak5wYt7ec
i mean there is 3 classes like all airlines but was amazing how they turned this to a upstairs like a 5 star hotel . paying abut $ 5000 usd for the first class ticket , then more for the extras on the upstairs premium level like , massage , showers , a bar etc. ... not jelous , but wow so nice . I just can not justify spending money like this for 1 day of travel . but those who can , mabrouk
You are still confused . There is no upstairs in the B787 . the A380 is the one with upstairs . Qatar Airways has not started the A380 yet while Emirates have .
B-787 arrived yesterday at 10:50 UTC or 13:50 Doha time , under the Call Sign `` Qatari 3787 '' . . This Particular Aircraft A7-BCB , would be used for a month to DXB in order for the Flight Deck Crew to Familiarize with the Aircraft & from Mid of December , would start flying to London Heathrow ... IMPO , Fares would be the same for Economy Class , but Yes for Business Class which has a Configuration of 1-2-1 would have higher fare compared to Business Class of 777s or 330s ...
yep wont fly farther then in gulf area until it gets its wings :-RRB- more flight time that is . Enjoy if you can.I will stay with Delta ... for now , sighhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Such salary is okay incase you are economic and know how to manage your financial matters .
it 's more than enough really . The major expense you will have is probably the phone . I can manage to spend about 25 rials on food everyday for 3 meals . Over a month that brings a total of 750 . Add some entertainment -LRB- a book or two -RRB- and you 're still under 1,000 rial !

Dear Friend As a design ENgineer this Salary is too short Minimum u can get 5000 QR

do you have a relative here in qatar ? if you do n't have , then you can not apply for a visit visa because visit visa is only applicable if you have relative working or living in qatar . the best you can do is to apply for a tourist visa thru travel agency or qatar airways . you can also apply in any hotel here in qatar thru their website ...
check with Qatar Embassy there . If you know someone in Qatar , please ask them to arrange
Visit visa need to be sponsered by Resident of Qatar . If you have any one to sponser , you may get it . Otherwise you need to apply as a tourist in Qatar . If you work in UAE as a Professional like Doctor Engineer Auditor or other Professional you may get entry visa in Airport . Please check it in Qatar embassy in UAE . Wish you a happy time in Qatar ... Most welcome ...

oh its badly !
yes , they have recently changed the rule . PCC from the country of orgin is only accepted The new rule is a big blow to the job aspirants
Yes , they change rule & they changes very frequently , any certificate must be attested by home country 's ministry of forein affairs & embassy in doha , only then they attest ...
They themselves are not sure what they are doing . There are rumors that some of the Certificates issued from the BD Embassy are being accepted though they have not informed the Embassy that they will not accept the certificates issued by the Embassy . I think it 'll take some time for them to come out of their confusion .
it is changed or amended . amendments require when and as necessary . even in sea & air port too . now most of the airlines does not allow or encourage to carry liquid substances in flight after liquid bomb threat . law enforcement authorities are their to protect us by amending existing   old laws . v need to understand the situation & work accordingly.some times v ask the authorities to amend the existing law , when v fall in trouble.if u read daily news papers or the ministry sites , u would have saved ur time going there . cheers guys & b happy

It is available her all over the place . The rate for the basic wii is about Qr1300 . - / 1400 . - . However the additional games are not really available.So compare prices and make up your mind . However do buy the additional games to the package there . Aisha-Taweela
Wii + Wii sports is 175 on Amazon . The price Aisha quoted above works out at about 245 , so cheaper to buy the console in the UK and I expect cheaper to buy the games in the UK a well . -LRB- For example , Playstation 3 games cost about 60 here , which is way more than in the UK . -RRB-
its available here but if you get cheaper from your foreign money , why not buy it there . You might blame yourself later on in doha if you find out its cheaper in UK .
If the person you are sending money is trustworthy you can send thru Western Union .
give it to me ... :D :D -LRB- kidding . . -RRB-
send it via western union or xpress money .
first end it to india ... then they send to USA from there
if the other party has a bank acct in US sent it by international bank wire , . cheaper and faster then by money exchange company
I think the salary limit of Doha Bank to get the loan is Qr . 7000 / - .
Try First Finance its next to Muntaza gas station .
try with other banks , if you have above 5,000 salary it is not so difficult , you need to give them salary certificate from company only .
It depends on your Bank sometimes , If you have a QIB account then go to Al-Jazeera ... I took my car from there without problems ... It took 10 days to finish it because they were not clear about what papers they need and kept asking for them 1 by 1 and of course you ca n't get those at one day ...
Try IBQ . But again , your salary has to be transferred and the company you are working for has to be approved at the bank . Then you should be eligible for the loan if you meet the loan requirements . Otherwise , try finance institutions such as first finance , they might be able to finance you . Regards , Hamad
Hamad you work for IBQ do n't you ?? Try them though 4473000
call 3450493-rahul he is into sales at CBQ . try ur luck .

Being a Acupuncturist My advice is the Blood Pressure is a natural process and the heart maintains its pressure high or low as per the demand from other organs . be Prayerful and Pray Lord for forgiveness . When the Heart becomes peaceful the blood flow will become normal . There is point Sp5 which needs to be activated provided you prayerful and submit to your self to GOD . Forget about medicine nobody in this world can cure any disease except GOD . read this web site `` www.foolproofcure.net ''

U can get seeds from ... from . . opz i forgot the name of that shop . well i ll tell u the location . . If u are coming from toyota signal to gulf cinema , from gulf cinema signal take left . . If u take left , first u can see that on ur right side . .
There are many plant shops at the Central Market behind the fish market
You 've probably left it too late for this year as it will soon be too hot for these plants . What I 'd suggest is when the plants naturally run to seed , pick a few seed heads and keep them till September , then sow the seeds in a good quality potting compost ready for next winter .
Try a nursery which sells plants
Petunia the one which is available in many color -LRB- purple , white , yellow , pink , red , mixed colors -RRB- doesnt easily come up when u sow the seeds instead its better to buy a fresh plant with flowers form any nursery ... garden nursery between gulf cinema and mall round abt is where i usually get plants from . Marigold comes in three to four variations and they grow from seeds very well ... like wut baldrick said u cud try it in sep as it already getting hotter ... chrysanthemums also u can find in roundabats and flower in bunches like the above two , plant is better tahn trying from seeds . As far as seed is concerned u cud get it from FFC , LULU , Giant or any nurseries ... enjoy gardening ...

What ever you bring , be sure to check that it can take both 110v and 220v . Do n't take that for granted that all electrical appliances from there will take 220v as we have here .
I would say BOSE headsets , it 's almost 40 % cheaper over there
QS , along Salwa Road there are numerous tire shops . Mostly they have a big sign for the brand they sell . Here in Qatar it is not neccessary to buy high speed rated tires -LRB- HR -RRB- type , because the speed limit in this country is 120 km/h . I have an American car and I buy American tires , `` Cooper '' . If you have a Japanese car , buy Japanese tires -LRB- Bridgestone -RRB- , if you have a European car buy Dunlop or Michelin . -LRB- But it does n't really matter much . The speed limit counts everywhere in Qatar -RRB-
I recently got tires from there . They are 20 % more expensive than the Korean . It is worth it . Just make sure the tires are made in Japan . They are located right after Thursday/Friday market roundabout along Salwa rd towards Industrial area . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = http://www.qatarliving.com/node/58409

hey , this is a nonsense . business visa maximum can last 3 months , then they <u> must </u> send you out of country . Then you do n't need any NOC , just start processing your work visa and RP with your new company . . but if you want to transfer while you are here in qatar you do need a NOC . Otherwise just wait till 3 months are finished , and you are out of qatar <i> <b> ********************* `` What lies behind us and what lies before us are small compared to what lies within us .

Applying for an NSO authenticated MC only takes 1 week , and if you applied for a visa , will take you another week , plus translation in the Embassy will take you roughly 1 week . So , what 's the rush ? Ministry of Interior will ask you to get the stamp from the Embassy , and in order for you to get that from our embassy , it needs to be from the NSO . If you 're really in a hurry , buy a business visa , or book her in a hotel and get the 1 month tourist visa . If you want the 6 month family visit , you need the proper document .
If you need a 6 months family visa you need to undergo all those procedures . But if your wife will not stay more than 1 month here in doha you can go to hotel to apply for tourist visa . La Villa Palace Hotel is issuing a 1 month tourist visa for only 500 QR . you can call this no . to inquire 4367301 .
if you really want a family visa , you do n't have a choice but to do it by the book and get an NSO authenticated MC . what 's the rush anyway . . It 's better to get the authenticated copy anyway because im sure you 'll need it for other purposes as well .
Only 1 month maximum , you can get your NSO authenticated certificate . Just go directly to an NSO office near you . And you may also need the DFA seal -LRB- red ribbon seal -RRB- . That makes it more official .
For visit visa , as far as I know is that it its fime to have a stamped marriage certificate from you civil registrar . You will just pass it in the immigration unless it will be for Family Residence visa , a NSO Authenticated one is required . Try in wakra immigration the captain there was absolutely nice . .
Yes this is possible , Myself and my wife entered Qatar in September 2010 and she has sponsored me -LRB- The Husband -RRB- . This has also happened for another family we know of .
This already exist here.but it depends on company , salary
if this is true then - WOW - will solve a great many problems ...
It is possible even now . . depends on the company/nationality/salary etc. . .
Yeah , agree with FS . It is possible even now ... but how is the implementation of it coming along ?
For what it is worth : Nationality - American Salary - well over QR7000 Company - American University
really ? wow wow . . i donno this news yet but indeed a very congenial one . =-RRB- -RRB-
is it ? let me know , beacuse today morning somebody from our staff ask me this question . what is the procedure anybody knows ?
Would solve a lot of problems if this is possible

<b> When Bangladesh become the part of India ?? </b>
If your salary is gross and if u r not getting housing allowance or any other allowances then it will be difficult to save something ... Housing you need minimum 6000-7000 . car and related - 1500 grocery and food - 3500 medical-1000 -LRB- if u prefer to go private hospital and if no insurance -RRB- school - minimum per month - 600 / - per child . elect and water-300 other - 750 You can estimate how much u can save end of the month .
I agree totally with Pathanamthitta , you will not be able to save much , but finally it depends on you kind of living specially the level of education you are asking for , as you will find an Indian Schools starts from QR 2,000 per annum and up to QR 10,000 for each child . anyway i think you should compare the offered salary and the average for same position .
it 's good offer specially if they provide housing ...
accept it . . people now are loosing jobs . . dont miss it good luck
urs prfile shows u r bangali any way its good offer my advise accept it .
Good offer for an Indian
after you have mentioned your job details and your salary , you highlighted that you are an Indian !!!! I guess your salary wont be enough for another nationality and coz your Indian , it should be fine ? PATHATIC ...
Your salary of QR23 ,000 is good only if the company will provide your housing accommodation or allowance .
I should laugh at the answer of gfxmad -LRB- profile Bangladeshi and says Indian in the question -RRB- . It looks bit low for a family of 6 without accommodation but still you can manage to live without any savings . Try to negotiate for a family accommodation -LRB- 3bhk -RRB- even if the salary is 20-21k .
Sorry , In a hurry I put Bangaladesh as my nationality . TRUE INDIAN
You should decide in which shop and find out their head office . Those shops are tenants of Royal Plaza and does not belong to a single person or company .
Go to the Royal Plaza and ask the people working there . Good Luck !
dont just focus in one mall if you plan to work in shopping malls try to widen your application by visiting villagio , landmall and all existing malls in Doha . its like `` more coupons more chance of winning '' :-RRB- goodluck .
If its small amount you may can pay in lump sum . If not speak to the Credit & collection department of that particular bank & say that youre currently working in Qatar . -LRB- You may have to send the Appointment letter -RRB- . That youre looking at option of settling the same and ask how to go about it . or you can speak to the local bank here in Qatar and issue a Standing order to transfer cash every month to your respective bank in UAE . If you do not wish bank to know that youre working here in Qatar . You can ask one of your relative or a friend -LRB- whom you can trust -RRB- to deposit on behalf of you to Credit Card account . You can remit cash every month to your friend in UAE
You better settle it soon ! I am told that UAE has an agreement with all the GCC countries for non payment issues . You pass by the immigration anywhere in GCC , you will be sent to UAE jail . This is not hearsay . It has happened in my husband 's workplace ! Take care ...
Thanks for all comments.i would like to pay but is it possible to avoid or reduce intrest ?
first check how many months payment is delay and then which bank is that if you have local bank like -LRB- Emirates Bank , Dubai Islamic Bank , NBD Bank etc -RRB- then for sure after 3 months delay payment you will get travel ban . Once you will go to Airport same time they will take you to immigration jail Al Aweer you will be having a court next day , and after 15 days will be your sentence remember the pending payment is one hunderd or one hunderd thousand the punishment will be only 40 days only . and if its international bank like RBS , HSBC , Barclays then its not too strickt you can convence them but once its travel ban even bank can not remove till you will not pay . Go to online service of the bank send them mail comunicate with them they will give you solution even you are any where in the bank you can pay them . Best of luck ... ... ... !
Just put it under your arm and carry it in , no problem .
Good morning , There 's no regulations for getting such an item like yours , I would suggest getting it through either FEDEX or DHL , as both would guarantee the safe trip for your camera :-RRB- -RRB- Good luck .
i work for DHL and have handled such cases for Al Jazeera telivision ... i can assure you safe transit from the destination into Qatar including all customs formalities . You can reach me at Arjun.Balaraman@dhl.com for more details
its ok to bring that camera when u get here tell them its ur personal camera thats it coz as im working in the same field as you are . . i can suggest u to it will work . any problem u can mail me to majed@dtm.com,qa
Check with the Airline , if they allow to carry as in-flight luggage , no problem with customs otherwise through you luggage or Courier service .
All of the above answers are good . the most cost effective is for you to carry it in , as long as the camera is going to be for personal use and not proffesional use . there is no issue . If you are going to use it for work , you have to go through the normal channels to get approval . Send me a message I will give you more details . Having said that the XLH1 is not a large camera , so carry it with your hand luggage .

I do n't exactly know what type of medicine you have mentioned . Just a piece of advice , bring your prescription with you . Here in Qatar , you can not buy antibiotics without the prescription .
As far as I know it is for sale in the pharmacy with no prescription but some drugs have recently been regulated . Next time I go I will have a look . If it is available it should n't be difficult to get a physician to prescribe if you had to but bring a good supply with you as you never know when things change here .
It is classified as an anti-depressant type drug . I suppose my question is , is it legal for me to bring it as a prescription into Qatar . thanks
It 's fine to bring these drugs in as long as you have a copy of the prescription but , yes , you can buy it over the counter anyway .
you will have no problems , do n't worry about it . Get a stockpile in the UK as a prescription there is a shed load cheaper than paying the retail price .
hello . . as far as I know you can transfer your sponsorships to both another company if you found one & to your husband if you think it expires soon ! as long as you have your NOC , no objection letter from the previous company , NBI authenticated in the phils , -LRB- If you are filipino -RRB- sorry i forgot the other 's ... but yes you can transfer !! hope it helps !
Transfer Sponsorship is only needed if you want to move to new company directly at the time you resign . In your case , as long you have NOC , the new company will give you new sponsorhip , new ID , RP , no need ` Transfer Sponsorship ' letter anymore
Thanks guys ... but hope you can help me clarrify with this . . They said It needs 1 year or 2 years before i can transfer my sponsor ?
u go to one typing centre.Get a sponcership change form and u go to ur current sponcer get signature from him.U have to decide ur new sponcer .

If u are changing ur sponcership to ur Husband , he needs minimum Qrs .7000 / - Salary -LRB- bank statement must -RRB- u are now nine months in current sponcership , so that u need some reccommendation -LRB- vaasta -RRB- also . good luck
I really appreciate your answers ...
1 year minimum with 1 sponsor
I have the same problem as chille_001 , after nine months working for my current employer , I am having lots of problems with management , i would love to find another sponsor . Any one help ? What do we have to do any way round it ?
I 'd rather have no prayers on board an aircraft . No matter which god you believe in , I 'm sure , in your book , he 's doing a great job . But , surely the remainder of the passengers that are not religious , would not appreciate their fate being left in the hands of a god they do n't believe in . Pilots are supposed to do checklists , not prayers . Just seen from a non-religious passengers point of view . If everything seems under control , you 're just not going fast enough ...
I can understand that . . Like when I hear something in Chinese :-RRB- One of the Prophet 's companions used to hear the Prophet and his companions say rhetoric supplication so he expressed his disappointment to the Prophet that he can not say what they can saying that he only asked God for Paradise and sought refuge from Hellfire . So the Prophet told him : Around that we supplicate . Prayers or supplications should n't be complicated .
Why do n't you just not fly whichever air carriers who you believe do not meet your minimum safety standard requirements ... Of course that would mean that you need to personally check on each pilot and make sure he or she does not secretly place his faith on a God you do n't believe in ... Actually , I was just being diplomatic ... What I was actually saying is that what you just said earlier was utter rubbish
I suspect it is what muslims should say upon each travel . If it was that , which I believe it was , then here is what it said in arbic written by English followed by its translation : -LRB- Allaahu ` Akbar , Allaahu ` Akbar , Allaahu ` Akbar , Subhaanal-lathee sakhkhara lanaa haathaa wa maa kunnaa lahu muqrineen . Wa ` innaa ` ilaa Rabbinaa lamunqaliboon .

Allah is the Most Great . Allah is the Most Great . Glory is to Him Who has provided this for us though we could never have had it by our efforts . Surely , unto our Lord we are returning . O Allah , we ask You on this our journey for goodness and piety , and for works that are pleasing to You . O Allah , lighten this journey for us and make its distance easy for us . O Allah , You are our Companion on the road and the One in Whose care we leave our family . O Allah , I seek refuge in You from this journey 's hardships , and from the wicked sights in store and from finding our family and property in misfortune upon returning . -RRB-
PM : I 'm not saying I would get offended . I 'm saying pilots should be doing checklists not prayers . People can pray all they want , and they can leave everything in life to God , just not when I 'm on board the aircraft . I do n't believe in god to get me down safely , I DO believe in the pilots to get me down safely . Veri : It 's actually not rubbish . Following link is an example where pilots have relied on God to get them down , but he failed . Maybe if they had done their job proper , those people would n't be dead today . That 's all I 'm saying . http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/25/court-in-italy-convicts-pilot-who-prayed-before-crash/ As one of the readers have written in his comment to this article : `` The Lord may be my Shepherd , but I dont want Him as my Pilot '' . If everything seems under control , you 're just not going fast enough ...
he said , you have to pay during the journey to arrive safe . especially nowadays , too many crashs ! so do n't forget to pray ok !
Apparently he recited the verse specified for getting on board of a means of transportation . It could be translated to : Glory to Him who has subjected these to our use for we could never have accomplished this by ourselves . And to our Lord surely must we return back .
Cos it was in arabic .
He said # $ @ % ^ % $ #

Some ppl just ca n't handle religion : -RRB-
Why do n't you guys READ my posts . I DO N'T mind when people pray . I DO mind when they leave everybody 's fate in the hands of God . If you know your English , you will understand that `` I DO mind when they leave ... '' does n't mean `` I DO mind that they all leave ... '' In other words , I 'm not saying everyone is leaving everything to God , but some do and it only takes one bad apple . That 's all I said . QL : I can handle religion just fine . I just ca n't handle when religious people ca n't handle the truth . Veri : Nope , the one thing I can promise you I would n't do if I knew we were crashing , is scream `` I believe , I believe ... '' . I would be looking for the nearest exit and if time permitted , I would write a letter to my family . But that 's just me ... If everything seems under control , you 're just not going fast enough ...
and some people just keep on arguing about religion it 's not the pilot , it 's not the crew either ... . . it 's our tea boy . . Khalas . . Khalas . . Khalas . . Khalas . . Khalas . . Khalas . .
It meant `` Allah is the greatest '' . . ! ~ noms ~ ----------------------------------------- `` Before God we are all equally wise ' and equally foolish '' - Albert Einstein
You say this ... `` I 'd rather have no prayers on board an aircraft . No matter which god you believe in , I 'm sure , in your book , he 's doing a great job . But , surely the remainder of the passengers that are not religious , would not appreciate their fate being left in the hands of a god they do n't believe in . Pilots are supposed to do checklists , not prayers . '' and then later you say you do n't mind when people pray ... now you really have me confused
I 'm not surprised Veri . I give up ... If everything seems under control , you 're just not going fast enough ...
This happened during the prohpet 's time , after finishing a prayer , a man got outside the mosque and did not find his camel which he left . the man , surprised , said I depended on God ! -LRB- which we should do -RRB- and the prophet replied , tie it and depend on God ! So I agree with those who should confirm checklist is completed and not just depending on god while the tank would run out halfway !
It 's not recorded . The pilot says it after going through his checklist . It only takes 10 seconds .
Alhumdullilah most of them are in Wudu As-Sunnah As Saheeha http://www.islamlecture.com/
Yes probably it 's recorded becasue sometimes pilots are non-Muslims .
entire journey is nothing but glorification Subhanallah As-Sunnah As Saheeha http://www.islamlecture.com/
recorded or not ... . why would any pilot say that in the first place . Aana free , jaana free , Pakde gaye tho khana free .
he said fasten your seat belts . . right ?
It was all in arabic .
Its is only for people who are registered in that hospital , usually for people living in madina khalifa but the main thing is it is for every nationality
Thanks for replying saravakumar80 , Gharafa health centre is near or far away from Madina Khalifa.coz i am also in madina khalifa south , exact front of Traffic Department and my old health centre is Misaimeer Health Centre , near the vegetable Market .

I am very calm MD. . and I know what does he mean ... but who said , the married man is a sex expert ??? . . lol . . I would probably say it 's other way around . . <i> <b> ********************* `` What lies behind us and what lies before us are small compared to what lies within us .

Easier said than done . . She 's in the Philipines and probably dependent on him for support . .
I am answering qatarisun 's question . Married men know where to start , what to do , when is time to do , slow moving , do n't rush , patient , etc in everything . Single guy does n't have those experiences .
The poor guy is just stressed with work and home , so he goes screws someone to take his mind off things . obviously the other woman is the guilty party since she must have led him on and seduced him . . I think that 's what she means ...
right now we have n't talk seriuosly for almost 1 month ... i just really do n't know what to do . m here in the philippines and its really so unfair on my side
lol . . PM . . this combination is pretty much understandable and quite often in real life ... <i> <b> ********************* `` What lies behind us and what lies before us are small compared to what lies within us .

with your q. ... since fidelity is an issue here , ask him straight in the what the other woman has that you dnt have ?
you can not do anything ... does he know that you know about his affair ? <i> <b> ********************* `` What lies behind us and what lies before us are small compared to what lies within us .

qatarisun ... may be these girls -LRB- going with married rather than single guys -RRB- think an experienced person is better than a non-experienced ... we still hav to know the exact reason

since he is having an affair , how can you consider him FAITHFUL ??? . . lol ... another question , whould you still consider him HUSBAND ? well , it depends ... <i> <b> ********************* `` What lies behind us and what lies before us are small compared to what lies within us .

sorry for asking this silly question , but again . . why is that philippino husbands are constantly having affairs in Doha ?? no wondering , other guys are complaining , there are NO single -LRB- available -RRB- girls in Qatar . . they are all taken by philipino somebody 's husbands . . :-RRB- :-RRB- ... now . . why GIRLS in Doha are going with the married men , since there are hundreds single guys around ? . .

no , do n't consider him as a faithfull husband anymore , just think of him as a good husband who wants to share his love to few other in need of attention married women . nice 1st comment qatarsun , bullseye
so that no one will answer ... nyahahahahaha Well ... nyahahahahahha again ! <b> `` BRING IT ON DUDE !!! '' </b>
Why is it being generalised for Philipino hubbys ? Are there lot of distress calls by Phili wives ??? The other question is : has the initiator of the post clarified why she thinks her hubby to be unfaithful ? She just throws a casual query & people jump in to clarify , respond , suggest , argue & what not ? <b> Infidelity is an interesting subject no doubt , but marriage is a personal affair , is n't it ?
so what 's the prob ? Respect each opinions ... whether it 's good or not ... as members , we are entitled to it unless I 'm throwing nasty words ... am i right ? if not ... it 's up to u or . . . . . . <b> `` BRING IT ON DUDE !!! '' </b>
hahahaha ... I was kidding ... lol ... ppl r taking stuff really seriously . . and my wife is so precious to me . . weather she will take 70 % or not . . i would n't do that . . cuz I LOVE HER . . it just remind me with a joke of 2 couples were living happily and calmy for more over than 30 yrs . . ppl wanted to know the reason of their happiness . . the guy said in our honey moon we went for horse riding . . her horse was little bit naughty and it let her fall ... she looked at the horse and she said `` This is ur 1st '' another time the horse fell her gain . . she said `` and that would be the 2nd '' In the 3rd time she pop up her gun and hit the horse in the head saying `` that was ur 3rd '' so I shouted at her `` What the F *** u did , u just killed the horse '' she replied `` This is ur 1st '' after that they lived so happy for how many years . . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = </p> <p> <strong> My Music : </strong> <aÂ href=http://www.showcaseyourmusic.com/LittleGuitarist> http://www.showcaseyourmusic.com/LittleGuitarist </a> </p> <p> <strong> My Photographing : </strong> < a
harry , if you would n't consider that as unfaithfulness , then does that mean rajah should just put a poker face , and wait until he stops philandering or hop from one woman to another ? stand up for yourself and your kids . you might lose respect for yourself . do n't ever let that happen to you .
I think Harry was being flippant . . If Rajah Park is silly enough to ask such a question then He / She deserves a flippant answer . . I prsonally think that this is a troll having fun at our expense . . There have been too many similar threads from so called Filipinas lately . .
thats ur opinion . . for me its never silly to ask such question like this when u know that sometimes we need some advise . . ur culture our culture is different when its comes to marriage we do n't give up that easily . . as long as we could keep the marriage . . this things happen to me its not a joke or what . . i just need some advise and m taking my time to think rather than decide and regret later . .
my answer in NO , you hug him and give lot of love so he never do/think that mistake.only way is that think ... `` Helping HANDS r better than praying LIPS ''
If he 's cheating on you then show him the door ... simple ... he would never accept you cheating so why should you ... and for all those `` idiots '' who are telling you its a normal thing as a guy , I think they are talking a lot of BS ... when you marry you marry with the aim of staying together ... if you can not keep it in your pants -LRB- Guys -RRB- or gals then separate and go your own ways ... Being unfaithful is something that no matter how many times you say you will forgive never happens ... its there in your mind forever and eats away at you ...
There is a difference . . she is a faithful lady wanting to save her marriage . . he 's a low life . .
rajah park just consider yourself geographically divorced .
I like your thinking ... : o -RRB-
The question is that why he is diverted to hang around with other women , and why the other women like to have an affiar with him , your qustion did not justify for one Gender , what about wife is not faithful ... :--RRB- :--RRB- A House Divided Against Itself Can not Stand :
I hope it was ' t me A House Divided Against Itself Can not Stand :
I think you are just looking for excuses to ` stay ' with him . ou know the answer perfectly well yourself . There are NO excuses for cheating ... if you want to stay married .
hahaha . . Rajah ... u know the answer urself . I think u r not that stupid to realize by now if he is faithful or not . My next question is . . if u still trust him ? If not , then its time for you to move on . Otherwise , ur a masochist .
its very sad reading about the number of such cases in the Filipino community . . Poor wife in home country whilst the guy has a mistress here . The embassy should help in these matters . .
faithful - truthful , loyal , or true -LRB- to you -RRB- . As for relationships broken caused by being away w / each other , only your guilt of conscience can help you realized that . It 's a matter of choosing your own destiny .
it does n't matter if your wife tell you such . If you do n't wan na have an affair , you just do n't . Respect your wife as you respect yourself . Treathening is not the cure for cheating or lying or whatever ! `` so wag kang nega ! BIXOXA !! ''
FranElizabeth , just for curiosity sake , did you let her husband know ? I ask because I was in a similar situation . Only it was my friend/colleague . She used to have fun while her family/husabnd thought she was with me / busy in a business meeting . Whenever her husband called to inquire I had to lie -LRB- as she asked me to before leaving with her BF -RRB- . I thought it was ` nt my business to interfere in her private affair - but once her husband asked me directly if there is another man in her life and I had to lie . She is no more a friend but I carry a guilt because I know her husband really cared for her and looked after the kids in her absence .
It 's a sad pactice to cheat on a loving partner.Rajah , . . did u spk wit ur husband on the matter?decide to stay or leave after hearing his reason -LSB- pathetic , though -RSB- for the affair
as part of conjugal rights . But do n't mess with your -LRB- Filipina -RRB- wife as you might wake up aping `` MR. BOBBIT '' the morning he woke out missing his twinkie ... lol <aÂ href=http://www.glitter-graphics.com> < img src = `` http://dl4.glitter-graphics.net/pub/789/789734c9hsuc4ab6.gif '' width = 326 height = 163 border = 0 > </a> <br> < a href = `` http://www.glitter-works.org '' target = _ blank > </a> <aÂ href=http://www.glitter-graphics.com> < i
Darling , Unfaithful is just a word , nobody really give a important to it.men are men if they slept with other ladies it does n't mean he loves her or he is ready to give up his family hey !! come on . . if you only look on scientific side its so simple ... men needs to ejaculate once or twice a month -LRB- if i 'm right ? -RRB- but , anyway , they have to for health reason how they do it , its up to them . for women we do n't need because we menstrual period every month . and husband without his wife on his side is very difficult.the stress of everyday routine . sometimes you have to understand that men are not saint . as a wife you know your husband very well . women working away from home like middle east are not looking for married man because of sex experience . . they are looking for `` knight in a shining armor '' shoulder to lean on . stable and good paying job , huge bank account one who can give them what they want.easy life.extra curricular activities for free.mostly no string attached . hey ! its not the end of the world welcome to computer age . . you can do something productive than crying and feeling sorry for yourself you can twist everything its all up to you.cheers
just because he is here and you are there , is no reason to accept his unfaithfulness . Just like him , you are alone ... have you cheated on him ? My guess is no . You have to make the decision as to what you can live with and what you ca n't . Do n't just take it because he 's a man ... be a woman and have respect enough for yourself and do what is right for you and children . When he returns , have him get tested for any and all sexually transmitted diseases before you let him back in the house because if he has them , so will you if you let him back in your bed . If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous , he will not bite you ; that is the main difference between a dog and man . - Mark Twain -
Men do n't HAVE to ejaculate each month !! Who in the world fed you that line of BS ???!!! There is no health reason for this `` need '' . Men and women 's sex drives are basically the same . . its how its dealt with that 's different . You are giving the male the excuse to go find someone to have sex with because he `` needs '' to ??? Get real !! There is no biological requirement for that . And even if there was , they can always give THEMSELVES a helping hand . . they do n't have to go looking for a woman to have an affair with . Geez ... get real . . If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous , he will not bite you ; that is the main difference between a dog and man . - Mark Twain -
rajah it depends on HOW you found out ! , is it thru your own knowledge , or just a message from your friend , or your relatives gave you that information . sometimes it is very deceiving when things came up into our minds . Here is a classic sample . . The Boss and the Secretary . . One day the two of them drove to the Hotel , someone saw them while entering into the hotel , after an hour , the two left the Hotel . This witness spread the news that the two have an affair , they went to the hotel to release their desire . -LRB- Take note the witness was n't sure what really happen inside the hotel -RRB- The truth is , The Boss and the Secretary went to the Hotel to talk to the Manager of how they can promote their company with the help of the Hotel . for the meantime just trust your husband . . he maybe unfaithful as what they say but still he is your husband and the father to your kids . <aÂ href=http://cgi.godsview.com/cgi-bin/rcdenig/pdchap.pl?file=3753&occ=27> RACHE ist Bergwerk saith der Lord </a>
SF25 -LRB- hai how are you ? -RRB- If he have an offer then he is a unfaithful huband only . But what is your innermost feeling would like to leave him ? And plan yourself to meet out your day to day life economically.If you are self employed take decision boldely .
Rajah , u may cry a river over the situation , but my dear , u 've got ta be strong . This thing -LRB- sadly -RRB- happens whether he 's assigned to work there or in ME . U said u 've talked 2 the girl and could ` nt do anything ... well u better do sumthing while u cry girl ! crying is n't always a sign of defeat ... Once he comes back home , show him how faithfull you 've been opposed to what he has done , if this wont make him realize his mistake and rectified his misdoings , then by all means - dejar que se vaya , termine ! - easier said than done eh ? yes it is but if worst comes to worst - why settle to an UNFAITHFULL husband when you deserve much better , i dont mean u get even with him by doing *** let him realize what a LOSER he is for messing up ur family ... !! '' ... Remember , the shadows are just as important as the light ... ''
70 % of all OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Do I have to stop at 70 % ?
YES , you need to go to the Immigration Building # 4 , Madinah Khalifa . First of all , ask the typist -LRB- outside Building # 4 -RRB- to type ur tourist visa extention application , then go to building # 4 with that application and original passport . They will charge u QR 100 / - for one month visa extention .
Thanks . He really needs that info . He is quite afraid that he will go exit if his RP does not come out before the Eid holidays . He was only issued a 30 day tourist visit .
Hello friend , I do not think Tourist Visa is extendable beyond 1 month . Because , 6 months back I have arranged Tourist Visa for one of my relatives to come to Qatar through Cleopatra Travels . At the time of applying Visa itself , PRO of Travel Agent had warned that it was strictly unextendable . The simple logic is if there is any chance for renewal , the process must start from sponsor i.e. Travel Agent and defnitely not by us . Anyway , you may enquire at Immigration at Garaffa . So my advice is better not to take any risk or chances of overstay since the penalties are hefty . Good luck .
dear speedmark , did you try it out ... please tell me also ... since mine is alos the same case with my wife . . i hoped that her RP could be done in this month but it willd efinitly get extended . So I am also worried about the same . Any clue ?
Dear Vinith , The travel agency that we took the tourist visit visa told us that tourist visas can not be extended beyond 30 days of stay . They offered us to make an exit to Bahrain and go back to Doha for a new 30-day tourist visa . However , we opted that to transfer his tourist visa to business visa to the company that hired him and without going out of the country . It will be easy for him to transfer from business visa to RP because his sponsor is his company .
You would need at least QAR15 ,000.00 a month for yourself and your family but NOT INCLUDING accomodation and transportation expenses .
i agree with tess but bit more moderate and minimum can be 12000 + accommodation
12000 + accomodation .
grabe ... qatar is that expensive ? if im earning 12T a month , i will have no savings , all will go to waste ... from your answers an average of 10-15T for a small family to live a normal life here ? did i get the idea correctly ?
Here is lots of family staying with a salary of 4000 - 5000 , So living cost is depends upon life style

Energy drinks are often mixed with alcohol . Where energy drinks are stimulants , alcohol is a depressant . The mix can be particularly hazardous as energy drinks can mask the influence of alcohol and a person can fail to take its effects into consideration . -LSB- 21 -RSB- Normally fatigue would set in as large amounts of alcohol are being consumed , but the stimulating effect of energy drinks can override this effect . -LSB- 22 -RSB- Often drunk with vodka or in shots it has lead to increase in the purchase of pre-mixed drinks also known as alco-pops often containing guarana or taurine extract which provides energy drinks with their flavour . avoid giving them , make them to drink fruit juice .
Hi Abno , thank you for your advice . . Recently i read that information in Wikepedia . . anyway thanks a lot.God Bless . .
what I give you now is not a Wikepedia cut & paste . Most of the Energy drinks consists of Stimulants , some of which are used as `` doping '' by the athletes . Initially the drink may give you sudden outburst of energy , but studies showed that such stimulants weakens the nervous system in the long run .
Gatorade does not have alcohol and is not considered an `` energy '' drink such as Red Bull . Gatorade helps to replenish electrolytes and carbohydrates that are lost when participating in physical activities . It is also a good drink to have when you have been ill to your stomach .

dubai is 2 over crowded so qatar is better
Here is my 2Cent . . Qatar : Good to earn Dubai : Good to spend . Dubai has a sophisticated crowd compared to Qatar . -LRB- My personal observation -RRB- Peeps there know how to dress up . -LRB- Does n't mean people here suck in that category , You just do n't find -LRB- or maybe rarely -RRB- guys wearing jean with different colors on either side OR wannabe Nelly , Snoop Dogg , Eminem ... Dubai does n't have days such as `` Family Day '' in Malls , everyone is equal and when I say everyone . . I mean it ! But the best part is ... Dubai 's general mind set is at least 2 decades ahead of Qatar . Qatar has a vision , rapid growth -LRB- for the better or worse -RRB- , and a will to succeed in whatever .
You 've got an absolute fantastic answer above . . so i wo n't comment further . . Now tell us , where are you at present ?? if not in either of the country , why the hell are you asking this ??

its very hard to say that you can find or done your make-up less then 200 bc normaly rates are according to the occasion.i 'm a make-up artist and my charges for model or party make-up 300qr and then go on and on so obviously saloon takes more then that but hopes maybe any saloon did this job so cheaply .
its very hard to say that you can find any make-up services at this rate , i 'm a make-up artist and my rates for model or party make-up is 350qr and then go on and on , obviously saloon takes more then that , normaly rates are according to the occasion so hopes and also wish that you can find or did your make-up at this rate or maybe you 'll find any saloon who did this jobn at very cheep rates .
I agree with the fact that it depends on the occassion ... But dear I can tell you something that will be a good help for you . During weekends there are usually make-up artist that came from european countries who came to Qatar to promote what ever brand of Make-up they are selling . It usually happens at Sephora , debenhams , highland and the likes . You will be lucky if the occassion that you need to go to falls on weekend . They can do your make up for free ! Well almost ... because you need to buy at least 1 of their items . But at least you get your make done by a real proffessional for a fraction of the price . Hope this thought helps you . Good luck !
Not good
Al Bayan Compound used to be only for Qatar Petroleum Employees only until recently when they have allowed a certain amount of Villas to be let out to outside people . Generally the Compound is good for the price you are paying for it . Decent size Swimming pool . Rooms are quite big size . It has a shop etc. . So on a whole for the price that they are charging it is a good deal . If you want better than you have to pay more .
Thank you UkEngQatar . Your input is very helpful .
Based on what I heard from friends who lived there temporarily -LRB- newly hired QP employees -RRB- , or renting there : Pros : - It is decent for the price - location is pretty OK - Villas are good size Cons : - Temporary accommodations for QP newly-hired , high turnover of tenants - Furniture is horrible , old and bulky - Area gets very congested near Saad Stadium when there is a game When it comes to housing , it is relative and greatly depends on your life style and what you are used to . I would say visit a few times and see a few villa 's before you make your decision .
can you pay 20 % downpayment
I seriously suggest you consider saving for a car . No individual in their right mind will let you take their car away without full payment .
i am ready to pay installments like what we pay to bank.My only problem is they are not giving as company not in their list . Thats why i go for this option . Really i need to buy one . Plz give me serious comments .
Go to honda showroom near tv roundabout , meet sales executives . they can help u.
. You can get car with 20 % Down payment and post dated cheques for the number of installments you choose to pay . Contact me if you need to go ahead .
Rent to Own is the ideal solution , if you have cheques to pay for your future installments . NB : Our company is offering used cars of Nissan/Honda/Suzuki / Mitsubishi & Kia in case you are interested .

as what i know , immigration does not allow a wife to sponsor her children for residence visa . just what happened to a friend of mine wherein the wife is the one who is applying for a sponsorship but the imigration and labor did not allow it , instead the immigration told them that the father should be the one to sponsor his children ...
my wife is under her cmpany & mine is under my cmpany and so is my daughter 's . i contract will be expiring soon and i hve to exit qatar but bfore that i need to transfer my daughter 's sponsorship to my wife 's . some say i need NOC letter from my cmpny that i am finishing my job contract so i need to transfer my daughter 's spnsorship to my wife so that the immigration will accept the transferring .
1 Personal Laptop -LRB- even if its box packed , New -RRB- is allowed for every passenger in most countries including Qatar , so do n't worry .
i have travelled very times with my personal notebook and till now so far no 1 said or asked anything to me but it should be one not more then that .
no problem at all ... its a necessity here in qatar .
If you bring along with you or with by someone . Then nothing to pay as it 's for your personal use . It means one person can carry one laptop while travel without any custom duty in any country except USA -LRB- Carrying laptop is forbidden in USA for non US citizen -RRB- . But if you bring through DHL/UPS/Fedex or any other cargo services then you should pay custom .
As i feel one or two does not matter you can bring , any electronic item either 3 or 5 more than this quantity they can ask for custom .
one laptop can carry with u. . . no charges al all / . .
well if you 're carrying more than 1 laptop , I believe they will question you . . I have brought my laptop here with me and I 've gotten no problem at all at the airport , considering that it is on my carry-on baggage . . someone will correct me if I 'm wrong . . have a nice day . .

IKEA is not good enough for Qatar or is Qatar not good enough for Ikea ? . . let me work that one out . I spent a whole day in IKEA last time I was in Dubai . . : -RRB-
You do n't need to publicly display your ignorance on a subject you have no idea about :--LRB-
Wish IKEA wud come to Qatar ... wonder why it still isnt here ... . great place to shop ...
BritExpat . . Here in the Middleast Ikea do offer a deliver and packing service . . hehehe . . Yes last time we were in Dubai . we treated 10 people with the best of Swedish food for just under 250AED including the deserts . . Now beat that . . : -RRB-
That 's the point . . I usually go to IKEA for the fish & chips and coffee :O -RRB-
some just want to comment everything under the sun . The so-called know-alls .
I love the hot dogs at IKEA ; - -RRB-
Lucy comeon . . IKea is a huge success in Dubai , and do you think Qatar is more quality concerned than Dubai ? lol never mate . Many things you get here is craps too
OMG ! The quality norms are high in the ME , therefore IKEA ca n't match them ... Thank you for a good laugh !!!
who serves her French guests Krispy Kreme donuts for High Tea while wearing her Dior suit with Laboutin shoes ; -RRB-
Come on ex , that 's quite posh , right ? :P Just see it this way : she was serving FRENCH people ... nuff said ;-RRB-
Oh Lucy ... you really really need to get your meds sorted ... Ikea is not good enough for Qatar ... but what about Rawnaq and Rameez and the junk furniture in Carrefour ??? Maybe the sugar from you Krispy Kremes ... gave you a blood rush
It 's not like she was serving nescafe to Italians ; -RRB-
The real reason why IKEA will not be allowed in Qatar http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6xIgaAPrwU&feature=player_embedded#
This a PUNCH ... do n't mention the 'N' word it is BANNED in my universe ... LOL
but they have maids to handle the tools ; -RRB-
Yeah Oryx ... true so much bad quality furniture around ... Its mostly the wood that is bad ... and they finish it off with a wood colored paper sticker ... which kids can just peel off ...
The sole IKEA Agent in the middle East is Al-Futaim . The reason Al futaim have failed to open a branch here is purely due to logistics . Unlike other furniture stores in Qatar , IKEA has a policy of accumulating all its items in one store -LRB- no backup stores in Industrial Area -RRB- . Thus , Municipality never granted them approval for a Doha store .
Is n't that a bank ? Hmmm , Lucy ... . ; -RRB-
Ikea actually broke ground for Qatar Festival City . Check it out : http://festivalcitydoha.com/index.aspx This website has a countdown to completion , which is expected Q4 2012 . It will be pretty far up Shamal road though , but not so far from Education City/Gharafa area .
you write to them in UAE and ask . Regards PS : it 's been said for a while now that they were going to open a store but nothing has happened so far .
Ikea is ok in India and othe Asian countries but it failed to perform in Singapore because the quality they give is 90 % from China cheap rubber wood.If they will give anything duplicate in Qatar the ban they will get forever.Where in Middleeast the quality norms are high or even in world Ikea tries to save it skin from there ... Trust me . . They cant fool Qatar people so that is why they are refraining themselves coming here ...
yes , in the mall , which AL FUTTAIM going to construct close to Qatar Bahrain Highway
Q : How many IKEA shop assistans does it take to change a light bulb ? A : Sorry , we ran out of light bulb stock . We expect it to arrive early next month . We do have ladders though ! You just go straight on , then left and then right .
Lucy , what a wonderful explanation ! I am amazed ... here I was wondering why there was an Ikea store in each and every ME country except for Qatar ... and there you are ... giving me this extremely logical and clear explanation ! You really made my evening .
par for the course : -RRB-
ex ex ... I have my moments ...
There is no any other hospital who will conduct medical check-up for visa purposes . . Only Qatar Medical Commission in Abu Hamour . .

Hey Happy Happy ... Thanks for the reply . . i was wondering if the area is resided by families or do we need to be alert about some things . Also are basic amenities available in the area . How is this locality compared to Al Sadd . .
It 's Almost the same . good to live there . cheers
K_K , It 's a good busy area , very close to Alsadd . The area is teeming with food restaurants , Toys R Us , Children ER , exchange office , BHS , MegaMart , ... etc I do n't know the exact location of your building , but the offshoots may not be well paved , if not bumpy , in other words , a car wrecker . All in all , I think it 's a lively area . If you like stillness , I 'm not sure you 'd like it . Traffic is horrendous . Salaam
Thanks Magistral and Happy Happy . The aptmt is just behind George Hotel and is a semi furnished one . . Are the semi furnished aptmts well maintained and given 24 hr service in Doha ?
All these details should be stated in your contract . Mine mentions 24 h maintenance , but this has nothing to do with Semi or full furnishing , I guess . Salaam
Try doha College . Definitly Stay away from international school of london . The international school of london is one of most expensive schools in Doha and yet the worst by far . Everyone i know attending the international school of London in Doha is about to leave the school . Poor education and a total waste our kids time to send them to this school . Stay away of this school and try other ones . Such as Global , Doha College , DESS . We and our friends had a terrible experience in regards to learning . Some of us managed to send the kids to other school and some are looking for places for their kids .
Try Al Rafa Clinic . I heard they specialize in Orthophaedic cases . They 're clinic is just across Home Center after Jaidah flyover , at the back of Pirelli Tires in Mushreib .
I would recommend Dr.Bhatt in DOHA CLINIC ... Highly experienced and knowledgeable person of his field .
Hi ... the waiting time in hamad is too long . Can anyone tell me about Ahli hospital or American hospital ... is there any doctor there who can handle this kind of surgery
smaller burger and fries ? probably an effect of world crisis : p
Maybe mac donald 's saw that it was more fit to serve a smaller version of big mac , and a larger version of the large soda and large fries in doha . :-RRB- <I> Mind your own business , then see the joy coming into your life .
i hate big mac ... : P
me too chen i hate big mac . never fan of mc donald unless am so drunk and they the only place is open . hehehhehee Everybody is right everybody is wrong , it depend where you stand
little mac ... or tiny mac ... lol
the smaller burgers are fine , i get extremely irritated when the person in front of me takes a fcuking lifetime to order . the menu has n't changed much in over 40 yrs !!!!!!! i know the fat fcuks are n't looking at the healthy menu so is the whole maccas concept so fcuking foreign over here ????
I ate my LAST burger with Mc D 's last week , and that is the LAST i ever want to eat that sh * t . When u see the pics on display and the crap they serve you its just mind BLASTING ! The mayo just goes all over your face , and fingers and the burger just wont stay between the buns ! Its like WTF my burger is ALIVE !!

It 's a shame we do n't go at the same time . I have given up eating meat but ca n't give up Big Macs so I buy one , chuck away the meat and just eat the rest ! I love the bread , sauce and pickles , not fussed about the meat .

I think it would be better to the buy the iPhone here . You get a warranty although its a bit expensive here . And about the unlocking bit , fear not cuz it 's a 2-minute thing .
I would suggest to buy it from here in Qatar but it 's rather expensive . . Got mine at QRS 2500 . You can also buy it from the US and have it jailbroken here . . softwares -LRB- for unlocking and jailbreaking -RRB- are also available on the net , specifically on eBay . The problem is that 3G iPhones does n't have an unlocking software yet in the market . . only for 2Gs ... just check first before purchasing or you 'll end up with a phone that does n't support the network . Have you considered buying a Nokia 5800 instead of an iPhone ? : P
I got mine from UK and unlocked it here , had a look in the US as well , but could n't find one with no contract , but it is definately cheaper than buying in Doha
you can not enjoy some of the features that is offered loacally if you buy US unit . and you may spend more of unlocking . local unit though more expensive but with warranty and guaranteed you will enjoy all features .
ask LP his fav radio station
As a result of your first 8 words , I am questioning your credibility ... ... ... ...
the biggest fan of QBS Radio
what is wrong with my 1st 8 words ?
You 're clearly a few sandwiches short of a picnic if you 're truly an avid fan ... in which case I 'd assume the mistake is yours !
It 's not that it 's a terrible station just that the morning time music show is awful ! The presenters are so out of touch ! Later on in the day it does get slightly better but generally I agree with DohaBrit and Chairboy about the OP 's first 8 words !
for god 's sake , the guy -LRB- or whoever it is -RRB- just asked how to send the message . . LP , tell him -LRB- her ? -RRB-
Sending song request to QBS radio is for Families only ... bachelors not allowed .
Actually i am negotiating the salary ... mostly it will come to 14000 QAR + Accomadation + travel and all ... I am really confused . . in most forums in the internet have differnt opinions . . i am an Indian . . This is the first time coming to Qatar ... Thats why asking ?? :-LRB-
Wait for some suggestions from indians I think their suggests would be helpful as from the same country , again its all depends on your lifestyle so I guess its pretty much good to grab it .
A person earning QR10 ,000 is enough to survive with a family . 15,000 is a very good offer .
that 's more than enough not unless you eat gold for every meal
Thanks everyone for their opinions ... I am joining as Business Analyst over there ... i have 6 yr experience ... in india ...
Dont think much
I so liked qatar3040 's calculation , food 1500 fone 2000 lol do you spend time on fone more than you eat ? I have 2 fones , one shahry and one hala , I spend more than 600 minutes per month + international + bb services and my bill never goes more than 350 / - QR
He 's not using Viber that 's why his fone budget is QR2 ,000 / month .
Thanks guys , , , , @manuprab its 14000 in hand + accomadtion + travel ... thanks for the suggestion . . will come there by january 2013
1000 qr more than enough , if you have a lovable wife
It depends on your lifestyle . If both of you and your wife are shopping addicts then it 's not a sufficient amount .
Considering you get housing , yes you can survive . Whether it is a good salary given your qualifications , experience and current earnings - no clue , cause we do n't know the same .
This is Good package . House rent : maximam 5000QR is 2 bedroom flat + Food expense - maximam 1500month . Telephone cost maximam - 2000QR/Month . Then you can calculate .
So the Food is good :-RRB- How expensive is expensive ? for a 3 course meal ?
Not that impressed , overpriced - the concept is apparently upmarket pub grub but at michelin star prices . Usual stroy in Qatar - let us rip the expat off who are so stupid as to go there . His michelin starred french food restaurant in claridges in london is not as expensive as the bloody burger you get . Better food to be had elsewhere in town . Another note , like most food outlets on the pearl , expect to be ripped off , over priced and bad . Except Carluccios which is ok .
I understand , its chef ramsey its supposed to be expensive , but how expensive is expensive is the question
Depends if you are drinking wine , if so , meal for 2 no less than 1000QAR carluccios is a lot cheaper if not quite so fancy
perhaps 800 then - all depends what you order to be honest .
are you talking about just for yourself or a meal with your wife and baby , which you do n't want any part of ? : -LRB-
Just myself and my wife , and the baby can sit at home .
I understood that his discounted lunch menu is probably the best deal to be had at Maze - but who wants to wing it all the way obver to The Pearl for lunch ... I guess business people with an eye on creating an impresion will .
its still pants
LOL Colt !
When they say a restaurant is run by celebrity chef Gordan Ramsey , you at least expect fabulous . Well , its not !

thanks remo :-RRB- please do let me know if you know some other useful websites ...
make one .
Yes you can withdraw ... just make sure there is something written at the side of the machine that says electron/cirrus . You also have to know there will be huge service charges so make sure you only do it few times ... cheers ...
Yes , everything is in your finger tips but when you use such fantastic service , you may be billed like roaming charges double the fee than you are expected. , so it is upto you to make use of your local cbq chicken giving golden eggs .
#tigress 08 Thank you very much god bless
Yes you can , just check if the logo in your card is included in the ATM machine . It will cost you USD$ 3.50 dollar for withdrawal .
while all the replies are best please remember that it is CBQ which have new methods of forking money out of your pocket
Yes you can withdraw from Metrobank , BPI , and Chinabank and any other banks with Cirrus logo , but i think Php200 will be charge for every transaction . Happy vacation ! Enjoy ! all the best !
Yes any where and any time you can withdraw money
Acha !
I personally LOVE Turkey Central 's , and Marmara Istanbul 's shawarama .
I think Turks are the masters in Shawarama . Marmara Shawarma . .
Turks , hands down .
TURKISH PEOPLE ARE VERY FRIENDLY UNLIKE THE ...
turks fo shizzle
Lebanese definitely .
Turks indeeed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No ... Go for Turkish Shawarma ... It is much tastier with good taste ... But see that it is not managed by Egyptian Cooks and helpers otherwise it will not be Authentic ... like turkish ... I think lebanese Hummus/Baba ganoujh is better . Foul -LSB- Mashed Fava Beans -RSB- by Egyptian is good ... . Like Hyderabadi Biriyani is best ... . and so on ... .
can you elaborate it bleu ? is it a rumor or its going to implement soon ? thanks for your update
Usually , we really know about it AFTER it is implemented ... anything else is just a rumor .
Thanks bleu for the genuine answer
brightsun , This is mostly about new contracts , What they would do with salaries is uncertain ...
We waited for so long lets see ... . . just wait for a month , it will be out .
Thanks Kiwi , I have been waiting for this . It 's so much more than I expected . WOO-HOO
Whipped with birch leaves or birch branches . Leaves sound kinky .
Thanks QatarKiwi . . its easy to make comments like this . when u experience this on your own then u will understand . Stop commenting like thjis if u dont know .
Possibly to do with the contractor not getting paid .
Ca n't remember if this from an article in the newspaper or from a forum here , but as I recall there are some substantial sums of money that are in dispute . could you imagine how much easier it would be to get around town , and how much faster if that section of road would be finished !
i talk to the man tht was sitting there i asked him he say worker not getiing paid
If I were not mistaken that project was more than 5 years now ... as far as I know , they started working that project way back 2004 and still not yet finished . I presumed there is a long long way to finished this project since it was completely stopped ang long overdue .
Doha Expressway Project original completion date was Sept 2008 . It was pushed back to Sept 2009 but now the payment dispute between Ashagal and the contractor has put it on hold indefinately . It is a terrible shame and I hope the Qatari citizens voice their displeasure loudly enough to get the problem solved quickly . The officials in charge should be held accountable .
I am not worked during the time , but I was told company will give me change at sept 2011 itself . But they delayed it for 8 months . whats ur point of view ?
Did you work for them between Sept 10 till May 11 ? I mean , actually went to the place and worked every week ?
Sept 1 , 2010 to May 2011 ?

permenent driving licence need id number which given to rp holder.business visa is short term visa and you can drive on temp licence .
thanks guys ... and how much would a temp license cost and how long would it take to get one ?
I doubt whether you get insurance protection with temporary licence . This is very important in the unfortunate event of any accidents . Pls check it out with traffic/insurance companies . .
yes u can take -LSB- temp -RSB- licence here ... contact with near by driving school ...
<p> <a> <strong> All companies would look at experience , education , but they would n't hire people just to hire them . They would need an `` open position '' , and they would want to evaluate many people who 's CV matches the requirements , and chose ONE person to fill that position . The companies will post the jobs on their websites just as a formality but finally these jobs will be filled with less competent guys who are the relatives/friends of those cunning guys in the same organistion . This is true in the case of companies like Qatar Petroleum etc. . For example , SAP recruitment process in QP now is 100 percent illegal as many qualified guys are not considered even for the initial phase of interview so as to reserve the posts for the lucky relatives/friends of those cunning guys in QP .

well if thats the case then they should n't post at all and they should n't interview people and give false assurance ... a week ago i applied with qatar airways and until now no sign of approval or at least rejection ...
Agree with Dracula . If u r a qualified person then your chance are very less and for those who doesnt reach that qualification point get the 1st priority .
atleast you had the chance when you applied ... you 'll never know what happens next ... `` just say something ... ''
lol TB ... : P
As long as you have NOC ... you can change as much as you want ... I personally have changed 6 times ... and I know a friend who have changed 11 times ... so as long as you pay for the fees ... there 's no problem and of course you should have a clean record in the CID Good luck
If you get NOC from employer u can change end number of times . Incase if you are looking for transfer than minimum you have to complete one year of service with every employer . The difference in Transfer an NOC is completed different In tranfer you do not need to go back for medical , or exit the country it can be done locally.whereas in case of NOC you have to exit the country and comeback on fresh visa , do the medical , fingerprints and so on Best of luck Regards Felix
hi Felix , One of the man power recruiting company is ready to give me a Foreman visa.But on condition that they wont give job or salary -LRB- mutual understanding -RRB- . The purpose of taking visa is to live with my spouse working here in Doha.My doubt is that i can work for any other firm on this visa during the first year . ????????? The sponsoring company is least bother about this -LRB- But they told me that if any authorities find this then i will be fined -RRB- . On completion of one year the sponsoring company will give me NOC -LRB- without change of sponsorship/transfer -RRB- to work with other firms.And on completion of second year -LRB- , they told me , -RRB- they will give me transfer . The above mentioned is my story.Could you tell me the legal aspects of the above said situations?Can i work during the first year for any firm other than the sponsor company if they have no problem .
diyarose ... to answer your question , yes some companies do accept working for them on different sponsorship ... send me a message on your qualifications , since I might have a part time job for you at my company ... All the best

Flan yes the one game where I was to run into you had to be Australia vs India :-LRB- Sad that I am going to miss Australia vs Korea tomorrow but have to go and support India : -RRB-
@ flan , that 's Qatar for you , they `` give away '' loads of tickets to `` VIPs '' who probably ca n't spell football & are obviously not coming to the game , those tickets will lie somewhere & get thrown away with the trash next week but give them to g
For the cricket matches in Mohali stadium next to my home in India they do n't issue more than 4 or 5 tickets per person during ODI games . Helps to curb black marketing .
I am also seeking 6 tickets of IND-BAH match on 14th , if not , only ONE -LRB- for me -RRB- will do :-RRB- -
how many karala players in indian team ?
Jack in Joke MooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooD : P
Sold out ? I thought sales is a transaction between cummodity/service and money !!!!! thses are given free ; -RRB-
what to do ... too much Indians here = P
relatives dude ...
`` Sold out '' ?? Where are they playing it , in a taxi ?? The game has all the attraction of a weekend in Brisbane !
Let the stadium be full for others to see as Qatar is hosting WC 2022 .
All the tickets were ` sold out ' before the Aus India match but the stadium was NOT full . I think the tickets are being bought by : 1 . Companies/Corporations as complimentary 2 . ticket touts who hope to make a profit at the gate 3 . Indians ... there are a lot of Indians here and they are good supporters !
There are no sold-out matches ! All the games were held in front of a few spectators ! No stadium was filled !
Oryx ... I think its 1 . Companies/Corporations as complimentary . If it was 3 genuine fans buying the tickets then it would have been great . But its not and thats SAD :-LRB-
ATM can serve fro both current and saving account
CURRENT ACCOUNT FOR SALARY TRANSFER , AND YOU WILL NOT GET INTEREST ON CURRENT ACCOUNT
for salery transfer u need to open curent account . my advice for u doha bank is the best bank at this time and they have duble salrey draw its good chance check your luck .
There is a 2 type of accounts in the first one is the current account and savaging account , depend on you to decide which ??
Friend Go for saving account . Only Doha Bank .
Try Gerber food . They have little mini jars . Do n't use if it does n't make a pop sound .
where do i find it ? I looked for this product everywhere ...
Make your own . Its healthier and a lot more fun . .
Make your own or try Megamart ...
they sell Berber everywhere ... Giant store ... pretty sure carrefour as well ... then theres the imported ones at megamart ...

A number of my tuition students are from Parkhouse . There seems to be little support for those who lag behind in a particular subject . Also the number of UK qualified teachers with QTS -LRB- Qualified Teacher Status -RRB- is limited . You may wish to ask how many of the teachers actually have QTS compared to those that do n't . Many of the teachers are not from the UK and do so not have a background of teaching a British Curriculum . Finally , Parkhouse only follows part of the National Curriculum of England and Wales . The rest of the curriculum is based around what is referred to as the International Curriculum , which is created by a private company in the UK and is not endorsed by the government . This topic has been discussed a number of times previously so you may wish to do a search to get a better idea of the school . You may also wish to try other UK curriculum schools such as Doha College , DESS , Sherborne and the International School of London . Good luck .
As a user of the Qatari and British education systems for my children let me tell you that if you have a good teacher , your child and you are lucky ! Usually here about 1 in 5 teachers have that power to inspire YOUR child ! Be glad when you get one , no matter what school they are paid by ! Education is about inspiring children to progress , not about checking off what they have studied !
Craftyqueen , let me tell you that all the children who are not as good in reading as the rest of their colleagues are taken away from their normal classes , given to a volunteer parent -LRB- who is given a bunch of flashcards with no further instructions -RRB- who is supposed to help them develop reading skills . Not only is that wrong , but on top of it they miss what is happening in their class . And do n't try and tell me it 's not true - I was a volunteer parent last schoolyear for Year 1 . Is this the way to save on spending more time with the children who need more reading practice ? Why not do like the French School - extra hours of tuition after school ? Last swimming competition the kids were so excited to show what they could do - instead the swimming teacher used her own son to get a better place for Park House . The amount of dissapointed faces of children was heartbreaking ! Waiting hours for nothing ? Things are far less positive then what you make them seem !
Alumnar I am surprised you are willing to say negative comments about the school your children attend on QL . Maybe you should change schools for your kids and give those parents who would remove their right arm to put their kids into Park House their place . In the UK all primary schools ask parents to come into the lower primary classes to hear the children read . I ca n't understand what could be better than one-to-one reading . If you want to suggest a reading group after school which parents fund I am sure the school would be interested in your suggestion . In the Uk books were changed once a week - here in Park House its three times a week , their books are set based on their individual ability into small groups if possible . The teacher hears the pupil read at least once a week . Parents are asked to participate in their child 's learning by listening to their child read at home . Schooling is not a vacuum - a child can learn at anytime anywhere . As for fairness - the World is not fair and no school can be fair 100 % to everyone because not everyone agrees on what is fair - its personal opinion . If a child is brought up thinking the world is fair they will get many shocks when it comes to finding a job !
Some of the comments that have been made on this thread are more than a little misleading . For example , are we comparing Parkhouse -LRB- or any other school in Doha -RRB- with fee-paying , independent schools in the UK or are we trying to compare them with state schools in Britain ? As Parkhouse is a fee-paying school , I would have thought that the former would be a fairer point of comparison . One person has written that the standards at Parkhouse are `` extremely high '' . Well , if there is an acute shortage of school places , then it stands to reason that some of the more popular schools can be very selective about who they allow in through the gates . I have not heard much about Parkhouse 's Special Educational Needs policies and I suspect that they would not want to admit SEN children because that might affect their `` extremely high standards '' . That also might explain Parkhouse 's preference for nice , white English children . Craftyqueen has mentioned the SEC , the Supreme Council of Education . This is a body set up by the Qatari government and it is most probably run by a bunch of idiots . Therefore it stands to reason that anything endorsed or recommended by the SEC must be pretty awful . If the SEC were really so smart and so super efficient , then there would not be any private , fee-paying schools in Doha at all because every single parent would want their little darling to go to a wonderful Qatari school . In reality the Qatari schools are very bad and more foreign , fee-paying schools open every year and most parents -LRB- both Qatari and expat -RRB- seem to want their children to go to `` international schools '' . And have you ever heard of such a thing as a Qatari teacher ? No , I thought not .
Dear All , some comments were positive & some were negative . . this was in 2010 ... now we are in 2012 ... ccould anyone update his point of view ... or share his kids experience as a parent ?? because I 'm about to put my TWO kids there . . thanks : -RRB-
Should n't parents take responsibility for their children 's education ? call me stupid but if your child is lagging behind in reading writing or what ever should n't you as a parent take time out and do it with them at home ? . Instead of blaming the schools/teachers for this.Education starts at home ! : -RRB-
I dislike having to disagree with a fellow hippopotamus , but I do not think that Pink hippo17 's comments are very sensible . Many expat parents in Doha are not trained teachers . They are engineers , doctors or whatever , but they are not teachers . That is why they pay lots of school fees and send their children to school , in order for the children to be educated by trained teachers who are supposed to know what they are doing . Yes , of course very young children learn a lot from their parents , but a lot of parents simply do not have the time , the training , the experience or the resources to teach their children at home . As for SEN children -LRB- those who have Special Educational Needs -RRB- , I think that it would be true to say that there is a lot of pressure on many schools in Doha to focus on the more able students and to ignore the needs of children who are struggling . This is particularly the case in fee-paying schools . Schools that want to boast about their `` high academic standards '' do not want to give school places to children who might not be able to live up to these high expectations . SEN children usually need additional individual help and -LRB- surprise , surprise -RRB- that usually costs money . For many children in `` British '' school , primary education is , first and foremost , all about language development . Even a Maths or a Science lesson is really all about the English language , as English will be the medium of instruction and a good grasp of the English language , both spoken and written , will be needed by the students if they are going to participate in the lesson and produce written work based on what they have learned . Therefore there is a lot of pressure on schools like Park House to reject non-British children and to offer school places to nice , white English-speaking children who have nice , white English-speaking parents .
Wow , I did n't realise you had to be a trained teacher to help your own kids ! . . If my son has n't understood or struggled at school as parents me and my hubby are always there to help , that 's all I 'm getting at . . Some parents have n't got the time , your words . . Sad that ! :-LRB- We 've been paying school fee 's for years , so yes , you expect a high standard from the school who would n't ? . . But what would I know , I 'm just a nice white English-speaking parent ! : -RRB-

No qatar82 i do not work for HSBC But if you really want figures , for a relations manager , you could expect a salary of 15,000-20 ,000 , you could negotiate for a higher pay if you have good working experience ! I have worked in the financial services for a long time so i have some idea .
Hello , band 6 grade for a HSBC bank employee is also good enough for a person with a bachelor 's degree as well as a financial banking diploma with relevant work experience , i mean at the financial services . Salaries are paid according to the industry situations and of course position offered , what position they offer you ?
It is still at negotiation level for relations manager . . Not knowing if it is good and at what range should someone negotiate . . Any more details would be helpful . .
Personally , in Qatar ; Auto . There are so many idiots around that it is much easier to concentrate fully on the road , rather than the gears . There is also not alot of ` smooth ' driving in Doha ; lots of stop , start , stop at traffic signals , so automatic saves all that ' 1st gear , neautral ' arm-work . Just my opinion !
Due to traffic congestion , preference for automatic gear . If you buy new vehicle , then go for Automatic gear vehicle . Manual gear vehcile is going away from the current market .
It is preferable to go for automatic for ease of driving and better focus on road to reach your destination ... ... ... more importantly traffic is growing in GCC and if u intend to drive down to Dubai ... ... ... than better have automatic car to ease ur tension and stress building on roads ... ... ... . .
for girls : automatic for boys : automatic is better bt still manual is ok

There is an approx.QR6k jump for the 2009 models of Japanese cars -LRB- eg . Honda Civic -RRB-
I am sure price will come down by march - 2009 . Honda crv reduced price by 7000QR . Chevrolet is offering free service up to 30000km & free petrol up to 30000km . In middle east the price of car in Qatar is highest . Dealers are taking huge profit . Steel price is reduced by 60 % . I am sure that car price will come down .
Usually , my advice would be to wait till end of March , when the whole financial year gets over where they can tally and c what improvements they can do for the next coming years . But even thou the world crisis are there ... nothing really changed out here in Qatar .
Chevrolet is a nice car .

I believe the money exchanges at City Center -LRB- across from Carrefour -RRB- has Western Union .
Yeah , here 's the one at City Center ; QATAR UAE EXCHANGE CITY CENTER BRANCH LEVEL N 1 SHOP N 66 Doha , 31645 +974 -- 4115031 For more , google Western Union Doha . I got almost 50 results !
No , I 'm not looking for Western Union here unless you know that they can provide money orders -LRB- I do n't think they do -RRB- . I 'm looking to get a money order , where can I get one ?
Hi ! There is Trust exchange , in National , there is eastern exchange near q tel signal in Musheirib , then there in also habib qatar exchange , in the national area . You can go to any of this exchange and transfer you money .
Money order can be obtained in Post Office . try visiting one and inquire .
depends on where u want to send money , most exchanges will give a certified cheque drawn on a bank in the receiving country a low rate , most Indians seem to send their money this way , costs only a few riyals rather than the 30 riyals my exchange charges or the much higher Western Union rates . I have used it to issue cheques in the UK and the Eurozone Much cheaper than a telegraphic transfer but u have the postal delay and have to wait for the cheque to clear . Go to a good exchange , they may have an account the country ure interested in . above all do n't send your money thru the banks as their rates are higher . try the Post office as well and make ur choice good luck
Turkey to most countries issues visa at the airport upon arrival . But if Egypt is one of those countries i do n't know . Better call the Turkish Embassy here in Doha .

32bit operating system only uses only upto 3 gb ram and 3 gb is enough ... ... and please dont give extra burden of heavy games it will surely damage ur graphics card ... bcuz these are not gaming consoles and its true that there is no update available more then 3gb ram for it which will boost its speed ... also use windows 7 ultimate in best performance mode
if you dont care to spend 3000 qr for up grade shure you can buy a better one . sell this and go for new one boss .
First check for RAM and HDD first . If u have a 4GB under memory in ur pc that upgrade ur pc from 2 GB to 4GB more and HDD speed is 7200RPM better than 5400RPM . Some raptop computer change to CPU . CPU , Memory , HDD u can buy regarding parts and change is very easy . If u changed memory size and HDD Disk that raptop more speed up . Anyway , ur os may be Windows 7 -LRB- 32bit -RRB- and u can changed to Windows 7 64bit but some device driver is not available . if u want to any question that please feel free contact us . my email is bcchoo@rocketmail.com -LRB- yahoo messenger id -RRB- Have good days . bcchoo
BTW what is Raptop bcchoo ? Back to topic . . Gaming : ? you need dedicated 1Gb GPU , 4 to 8,16 Gb of RAM Processor : Core2duo will be fine , but recommended i7 preferably with -LRB- thunderbolt -RRB- . Note : OS with 32-bit will suffer nowadays . i.e. if you are using CS5 -LRB- Photoshop -RRB- it will cry out loud . OS : 64-bit is recommended . As for your LG core2duo change the OS window 7 and if you are in 64-bit OS boost it to 6gb minimum . you will enjoy performance . Note : boosting the maximum RAM will experience High Temperature of your PC and its normal . Good luck

Western union
UBL near -LRB- Old al Ghanim -RRB- Cornich is the Best option for Pakistanies
If you have ICICI bank account in India from any of your family member , then you can send it through Gulf Exchange near Al Fardan . Gulf exchange will charge you Qar .15 / - transaction and it will get credited in 12 working hours , means if you deposit in morning , ICICI account in india will be get credited by evening and also they pay a good exchange rate compare to other exchanges in doha . The only you need for this is ICICI bank account number , Name of the account holder , Branch , and amount . This service is known as Instant Transfer , you can check or ask about ICICI transfer on Indian counters available in Gulf Exchange . I prefer this is the safe way compare to western union , amount ger directly credited in Indian bank account also high rupee value compare to western union .
Your home country is ? If Pakistan , preferred UBL , If India , use Doha Bank online remt serv .
Thank you all , altought i forgot to mentioned my nationality , but i got the answer , by the way i m Pakistani . Regards Naeem Khan

Japanese musical equipment is about 30 to 40 % cheaper here ! No VAT , only 4 % import tax .
Dixons duty free and save the VAT . I saved 150 pound on my Mac at Heathrow . Pretty much all electronics are MORE expensive here than any where in the World . Pocket digital cameras average about 60-100 pound more . I saw a laptop I brought my Dad in the UK going for almost DOUBLE here in Carrefour . I find it cheaper to shop at amazon and pay aramex to ship it here and it 's STILL CHEAPER !! Obviously this wo n't work with a huge TV but everything else get back home . Also anyone with a residents permit for Qatar can buy stuff in the UK and get the VAT back at the airport . Always remember to do this when you buy expensive things on your holidays .
Both can work and both can fail . Both need hard work to succeed .
What ever suits you !
love marriage with blessing from both parents is the most successful marriage .
It all depends on the couple to make it succeed .
love marriage is better AS U CAN GET TO KNOW THE DEVIL ATLEAST 1 DAY AHEAD ...
again ??? Yawwwnnnn
Ofcourse Love Marriage . How come you can live a life with a person whom you are seeing for the first time on your wedding day ? And hoe come you are gon na sleep with someone whom you dont know at all . Hate arranged marriage . I am from India and its common over there !
You are correct . Am seeing so many marriages / relationships failing . Seems that people are not willing to put in the effort required to make things work . .
Qatarisun , thanks for your nice comment .
9 years and counting , . and yes i does need effort and time , giving and taking from both parties involved
this is very subjective issue and not one can reach in general answer as it depends how the couples and their families make is succeed their relationship . therefore , the best thing is both couples and their family should be happy with the union from which direction comes either from love or arranged ... : -RRB-
useless talk why this topic ... people please do n't waste your time
Arranged marriage to a 6 year old is poplar in some parts of the world . More like child abuse to me
Well , since we have 2 species now , the arranged marriage and the love marriage , let things go full circle and invent the `` arranged love marriage '' .
Love with arrange
Anything but arranged marriage ... Either way , most people get miserable after getting married lol .
Love marriage . Why ? Because I 'm old enough to make my bed ...
both ... its different in the beggining but later same . personally i will say love because i neva wan na be with stangers .
This debate is indeed an endless one . Usually , those who are comfortable in their marriage would always have you believe that it is arranged marriage or love marriage , whatever their specific case , which is better . On the contrary , those who are not happy in their marriage will always claim that the form of the marriage other than they had is better . The fact is that there is simply no way to tell which one is better . For some people love marriage works magic , for others arranged marriage opens the heaven 's door . To a large extent , it luck .

I mean it 's not an endless discussion , but letting people choose for YOU who YOU will be staying for maybe the rest of your life is just plainly unthinkable , unless you have some really bad self - esteem issues that you ca n't do it your own . @JJH And congratulations , hope you 'd be prospering till eternity !

Arrange Marriage : -RRB-
Is that some kind of reversed psychology ? < ahref = `` http://s1324.beta.photobucket.com/user/MysticaUK2009/media/Emoticons/image_zps939ebcee.jpg.html '' target = '' _ blank '' > <imgÂ src=http://i1324.photobucket.com/albums/u619/MysticaUK2009/Emoticons/image_zps939ebcee.jpgÂ border=0Â alt=Photobucket/> </a>
jjh , no , it 's applied physics .
it take a lot of effort to make marriage successful , whether love or arrange ... my opinion chill and let others chill too ... and no two persons can have the same expirences ... its your journey do it your way
if u love someone then marry her but never leave her n go for arrange marriage becoz of someone wish as u will never forget ur loved one n u will always blame the one u married and nt the one who arranged ur marriage . . and if u dnt love anyone then go for arrange marriage and love will come after .
Does n't matter get in bed this way or the other . . :P But seriously , i believe its not the `` kind '' of marriage which makes your marriage life successful . . its the 2 people in it !! i have seen extreme cases in both types of marriages , love or arranged does n't matter .
None : D

Sorry , I find Damas rather expensive . Diamonds do have an intrinsic value and thus tend not to be discounted . Mandi
@ bawaqar. , im jst helping out somebody , . btw its none of your business , . thanks evreyone though for the answers !
It was a shot at humour , which went wrong . Sorry again . Please have no hard feelings .
we 're cool . .
a friend of mine bought 2 rings from Damas in the past and both times , the stones fell out . . getting them replaced was not that easy as their customer service is really bad .
Damas is a bit expensive than the others . . Alukkas is relatively cheaper but somehow I never liked their stuff but you can go and check . . Do n't expect any major difference in diamond prices though .
WK - you 'd be surprised at the price difference . That 's why Damas does 50 % off sales a couple of times a year whilst Alukkas does n't . Just shows how big their markup is .

I heard that they changed Facebook and it sucks . What sucks about it ?? Motherhood ... The hardest job you 'll ever love ! : -RRB-
well in my opinion , both are good ... facebook has got more popular over the months and even hit headlines ... my space was the same to back then ... it was just as popular just as cool ... but i stuck to the facebook profile since it has loads of games and information ... and is still developin
go ahead and open up a facebook ... it 's easy and it 's free ... i do n't really see a reason not to . keep in mind though that it 's starting to die off ... within 18 months it 's gon na be as popular as ICQ and something else will come in it 's place .
So if I open up a Facebook account , if I do n't like it , can I delete my profile ? I am just wary of it since you ca n't check it out without signing up . Motherhood ... The hardest job you 'll ever love ! : -RRB-
yeah definitely ... some people are also a little worried over how their information will be used and stuff but that 's all just good old paranoia . open one up , check it out , and if you do n't like it then deactivate , it 'll be as if you never signed up in the first place : -RRB-
Cool , then I 'll check it out . Thanks for the input ! Motherhood ... The hardest job you 'll ever love ! : -RRB-
Thanks notfromhere , did n't even cross my mind to search for Facebook on QL . It would seem to me that if they were a good website you would get to check it out without signing up . Usually that procedure gets you into trouble . Thanks again for the tip ! Motherhood ... The hardest job you 'll ever love ! : -RRB-
nfh ... the only personal info you get plastered all over the internet is the info you provide . facebook can not find out anything about you that you do n't tell it ... there is no spyware in it that follows you around to other sites and sees what kind of person you are from other internet activity ... the whole mess about personal information abuse was that it was going to be used as a statistics tool for marketing purposes if you 're uncomfortable with sharing some stuff then do n't ! facebook does n't require any real information from you ... the fact that you can open a fake account proves that facebook is not out there to get you and your personal information though , if it was that kinda site it would be much much harder to open a fake account .
facebook is good . i had a facebook account i just closed it bcos i just got addicted . lot ot of time which u can use for many other purpose is wasted . . but in ql we get lot of informations
Its all about taste ... :P Facebook on my taste is better that MySpace :-RRB- On the move ...
Even if you de-activate your account it is always there ... that is one thing with Facebook you can never EVER really get rid of the account ... you de-activate and the minute you wan na go back you just log in and its up and running again . I personally do not like it ... but thats my opinion ...
maybe you can bring this cute one . i have seen many here . you just have to comply on some requirements of bringing one here , get some permit and you should have with you his/her birth certificate .
Would you happen to know which requirements I need to comply ? And which permit I need to get ?
Contact Qatar Pet Travel ... they have a good website and will let you know all the details
I think you do n't have permission to bring big pet . . so for kind information you should contact Qatar Pet Travel . http://www.amirafoods.com/
Great Danes are not banned in Qatar and big dogs have always been allowed into Qatar . Whoever you are getting your info from is feeding you false information . Please go to www.qatarpetrelocators.com for info and mail contact@qatarpetrelocators.com for assistance with brining your animal . Doha is not a bad place for pets . Its the same the world over . Just because Qatar is a small country , it seems like we are over run with animals . Just remember that when taking your pet from Qatar - Europe -LRB- if thats where you go to next -RRB- requires added documentation .
Yes , just try contact Qatar pet travel . i understand your desire of bringing your Dane with you . my daughter like your age is also keeping another kind , so adorable and sweet . Try search of possibilities of bringing her in .
Up to last year big dogs were not allowed . . but things are obviously changing ... As Oryx suggested , contact Qatar Pet Travel .
I was actualy considering to drive to Qatar with the dog . It will be a lot cheaper and it will be an amazing experience ! I just thought that the great dane might have been on the ` ban-list ' in Qatar ? But I will try to contact the pet travel company to hear their say
How would you drive here ? You , as a female , are not allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia . I do n't know where you 're coming from but if , for example , you 're coming from UAE - you would need the proper documents issued by the UAE authorities/vets , probably documents allowing you to import/transit an animal via Saudi -LRB- if a man is doing the driving and if you are married to him , his sister , or his daughter or his mother -RRB- and then more docs to allow the dog to enter Qatar . If you 're coming from further afield and have more countries to pass through , it gets even more complicated on the document side . I suspect nearly all of these countries would require a vet inspection by their vet before allowing the dog entry/transit through their country
And I will of course make sure that the dog is fully vaccinated and have all it 's documents in order - and that goes for every country we will transit . Also , I would have my stepfather come and pick me up in Saudi , as women are not allowed to drive there . When I was last in Doha , I was told that bringing a Great Dane was illegal and impossible , but now I see that they are only restricted , so I guess I have all my questions answered . Luckily my family lives in a big house with a nice garden with the lagoona in the backyard , so apart from the heat , the dog would n't get it any better . : -RRB-
Saudi may not recognize your step father as your step father . You should check that out before making any firm plans .
Oh . . Maybe you are right . He is also my sponsor in Qatar - do you think that would be enough ?

Yes , it is working . . One of my friends in Mesaeed is using Big TV .
How big 52inch ... ... yeah it should work : P
It works great by pressing the on/off button .
usually big TV dont care if it is in qatar or not , its not related to the weather and has no problem with desert and the law dosent mind a big TV working , so if the TV is not damaged it will work , but TVs 300 '' and more maybe not working in qatar ...
<P> yes working , if u hv high end receiver DTH then it can catch 18 % signal so easily . </P>
Yes , it will be opening in march !
No official opening yet .
where is the location of the cultural village ?
there are a couple of restaurants that are opening within the next few months , i think . i visited with a friend of mine and we saw a nice Indian Restaurant and an Egyptian traditional restaurant . i dont know if they are fully open but we saw some people inside . we also saw some other restaurants right in front of the beach area . one was looking like a nice lounge with great interiors ! -LRB- we saw only from the outside of course ! -RRB- and the bigger restaurant looks like they will have a show kitchen -LRB- with glass windows to see the kitchen -RRB- . the place is huge with a nice view of the pristine beach . they have cleaners everywhere to keep the place tidy . i cant wait for it to open to the public . im sure it will be one of the nicest spots in Doha .

There is only one Roman Catolic church in Qatar which is now in messiamer near Woqod petrol pumps . The above mentioned website is correct only the map is a bit old as u dont have to go all the way to salwa side as there is a new road from the Woqod petrol pumps round about . Eventually there will be 5 churches in that area .
Link to website should be : http://www.rosaryqatar.net
They are correct , the roman catholic church is in Abu Hamour , far opposite of the Wooqod petrol station ... I missed this church very much . The last time I was there was in June of this year , before I left Qatar for UAE . It was the best roman catholic church i 've ever seen in the region ... Can someone tell me or send me pictures of the road going to the church ? Just wan na know if its okey now as compared last June . And how about the transport system ? Are the Mowasalat buses flying to this route nowadays ? I hope so ... Anyone ... please give my best regards to Father Tom ! I 'm missing his homilies ... which I really love to hear over and over again ...
Steven , the roads are getting better now and there is bus service but not reliable .

shelf life : http://www.foodprocessing-technology.com/glossary/shelf-life.html about tire shelf life : http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3088188 http://www.advrider.com/forums/showthread.php?t=459895 one said he had over 5 year old tires mounted and they are perfect for a few years ... it is not the km you drive it is how you drive and they are work out it is also not the years ... again it is HOW you drive and they are worn out . but before you mount them they have to be save . . I try to google and no one has a 100 % correct answer to this Q. . but at the end they have to be save so just dont by old tires , it is your safety buy fresh new and crispy not spoiled tires and be save .
MRST2009 thanks for the joke early in the morning . Shelf life for tires is 2 years , 60,000 km or 3 years is after you mount them .
from the web ... Should tires be assigned a shelf life , like groceries , milk or eggs ? A safety research group says aging tires develop cracks or weaken when they sit around unused . Tire makers in Britain have just issued a warning to consumers . Replace tires that are more than ten years old , even if the treads not worn . And for a tire that hasnt been used , like a spare , replace it after six years . Reviewing U.S. lawsuits , the research group says that many accidents involved old tires . According to strategic safety expert Sean Kane , weve been able to document in a very short period of time at least 20 cases involving serious injuries and fatalities in the United States , and weve only scratched the surface of this issue here . !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but read this one : Shelf life not the answer But the U.S. tire industry says a shelf life is not the answer . Donald Shea of the Rubber Manufacturers Association said : What it is is a complex series of events that can make a tire deteriorate . One , is the amount of mileage ; two is the abuse it takes on the road ; third and perhaps most important is the maintenance that is given or not given to the tire . If the public gets the impression that they could continue to use a tire until that use by date that could send clearly the wrong message . When the NHTSA proposed an upgrade to new tire standards it also proposed an aging standard . That was deferred for two years because no one could agree on a reliable test that could artificially age a tire . The NHTSA is in the process of determining which test is best and hope to have research done by next summer . <!--break-->
You can check manufacturing date from the stamp on the side of tire . Stamp shows the week and the year tire was manufactured . Look for 4 digit number inside rounded rectangle . For example , if you see 4007 it means tire was manufactured on the 40th week of 2007 . SImilarly if it shows 1208 it was manufactured on the 12th week -LRB- early March -RRB- of 2008 .
Not yet , wait until after Eid Hoilday or beginning of 2009 , they are about to left the ban soon .
hi there is no problem it depends on individual situiation my friend last week change his sponser

Botox !!!!
I have found that cucumbers on the eyes and a peaceful nap in the sun can work wonders . <aÂ href=http://tinypic.com?ref=1zxxx1fÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://i56.tinypic.com/1zxxx1f.jpgÂ border=0Â alt=ImageÂ andÂ videoÂ hostingÂ byÂ TinyPic> </a> Failing that , use transparent sticky tape to stretch the skin . . Good luck . . Let us know how you get on . .
RofL Da / britey !
You can also eat more . Once you are round and fat you wo n't have wrinkles anymore !
hell no botox your bum she needs to have natural beauty not fake : /
Its expensive . . Try the Plastic Surgery Centre !
hahaha so funny esp Brit , just loved the photo !!! I quite fancy trying the botox thing , -LRB- not the pain -RRB- but the results etc. . Has anyone tried this before here ?
she did it was having slight pain for first day and since after that no complains yet
oh okay , might look at the plastic surgery centre , its got to be better than getting in a boxing ring !!!
common botox will take time and needles think about it and the pain and laying low in the desk and get stared by the doctor and all that crap you know . boxing ring is simple in a second 2 punches and pain for first 1 hour and then all fine : D
vry true ... i agree
Ageing and gravity is the culprit . . feel pretty and secured inside and it will emanate on the outside .
There ai n't no cure !
solution is get to a doctoooooooor
haha , yes I know , but there must be something out there to help reduce the visability ??
try some ripe papaya paste over your eyes closed for 10 minutes.Once I used an eye cream for eyes for wrinkles and it worked well.Later on I started using papaya paste and it works for me . .
There is a lot of dust in the air , reducing visibility !
<B> NO ! </B>
No there is n't , because if it was , expats would start leaving . .
we are TAX FREE !
We do pay tax in certain resturants and Hotels , Expats also pay the Tax of being way from home , Other wise there is no Gov. Tax Though the High prices do do well instead ... :--RRB-
we pay high rents but no tax
Only if you 're an American -LRB- and that would be to the US , not Qatar -RRB-
tax applicable in qatar for Non _ Qatari Establishments means other than Qatar National they have to pay tax . in an expatrate employee is not required to pay tax . But his employer is liable to pay tax if it is not Qatari
Depends on your experience and qualification Whats your job ? Anywayz its less . If you are single maybe you can manage
you could save 3000 + , but i feel the salary is little low -- F L A M M A B L E --
in dat case i will not come ...
so how much i shud expect ...
`` in dat case i will not come '' What a great loss to the State of Qatar :-RRB- Ban Spoon Feeding not Me
`` so how much i shud expect ... '' Minimum QR 30,000 . nothing less . Ban Spoon Feeding not Me

I think that is not a reason to complain ... the hotels are managing the prices for the food according to their standards ... It 's not like the alcohol ...
Babe , there is a telephone no . Such as 180 to ask which department you can comlplain . Otherwise , the gates of emiri diwan is open for your concern . Or , try the bakala , he selld definitely cheaper than hotel : - -RRB-
you can go to the hotel providing cheaper option
Do you know who owns the hotels ? I do n't think you complaint will get very far . Plus hotels are not considered a basic requirement of human life . They try to regulate basic food stuffs at supermarkets but not hotels .
I do n't think food in hotels can be classed as essential . Therefore nothing to complain about . Only essential foods are governed here .
the complain is not worth it . . brain please
Do you buy food items from hotel and cook in your house . When did that start .
Google and you 'll find some shipping companies . They do n't come cheap . They all have a minimum weight that you 've to pay for , whether or not your stuff weights that much . And you must select it to be shipped via sea . Usually reaches Doha in about 30 days . This is relatively cheaper way to transport items in excess of 200 lbs to Qatar .
How many boxes and from where in the States ? Just shipped out of FL with a 20 ' container , so I may be able to guide you a little .
Try Aramex or DHL ... Even UPS works ... or TNT ...
Over and NO ! Wow this question keeps popping up constantly . The simple truth is leave your stuff there as you are not moving here permanently ! The money and time you spend shipping items here AND back will be the price of the items . Do n't waste your time and do n't be so attached to inanimate objects . Prices here are reasonable enough that you can get a TV and electronics for almost the same as at home . Washers and dryers are actually cheaper - almost half the cost . Believe it or not quality mattresses are half the price as well - shows you how much you are gouged in the US . Furniture is cheap and will last the time you live here . It 's disposable furniture , replace every 5 years ... Count on spending 10 percent of the first year 's salary on air cleaners , dryers , dishwasher if not supplied and you 'll be fine . You can sell everything for half price to co-workers or on Qatar Living classifieds area and you 'll be ahead of the game . Buy your furniture here at Homes R US and electronics at Carrefour , Giant Store or Lulu and you 'll be comfortable . It will cost you money to ship or to buy so just buy . Simple as that .
Probably best not . Some locals take offence and call the police .
I agree with the above comment . I took my dog at the corniche some time ago . Not so good reactions from some conservatives.However , some locals and their children loved playing with him . =-RRB- Anyhow , I ended carrying him just to avoid any negative comments/complaints from the crowd there
better away from any one , , do not bring him or her , , , , , , to park . . There are many place to go .
Thanks for the replies . . Can you please suggest where can I bring my dog for a nice walk ? Someone mentioned private parks : where can I find one here in Doha ? I 'm new to doha !
I work with the company from 1997 todate , i resign and going this july . how much should i get End of service pay if ; a. 1997 contract is silent about end of service pay -LRB- it does not say anything about it -RRB- . b. in 2004 i need to process visa for my child , in that day i need a contract so the company did provide me a contract with date back of joining to 1997 , which says that gratuity `` WILL BE PAID '' . these document was signed and stamped by labor dept. in 2004 . c. again in 2006 , same thing is required for another child , but these time gratuity `` AS PER QATAR LABOR LAW '' the company says end of service pay only start on 2005/1/1 , thus i got only from 2005 . is these correct . your input/comments is or will be highly appreciated .

i think theres a cellucome in family food center upstairs the one near the airport . not 100 % sure though
Thanx would check there today dear : -RRB-
Is it just under Cellucom -LRB- shop -RRB- warranty or under the company warranty . . if its under company take it to htc service center . .
True . . cellucom has shutdown recently . . you could check with Jarir who is another re-seller of HTC in qatar . i know that they are servicing HTC but only for the units which you bought from them . but still they will be servicing your 's with normal service charge . . did you check if there is any problem with ur charger ?? if charger is having problem then you could buy an additional charger for less than 100QR and its available in almost all the IT shops -LRB- PCone etc. . -RRB- Good Luck :-RRB-
the best time to visit that place in my opinion is sunset !
between 4 to 5pm not too many people around and do it in week days .
Its neither easy not advisable to go there for making friendz ... its better if u go with ur existing friendz ... by the way ... as per me the best time to go there is late at night ... because the atmosphere is gr8 at nite ... !!!!
i prefer to go there between 1pm to 3pm weather so nice and not that hot . places empty not that rush
I would suggest that you go there arround 4:00 -4:30 Browse around till 7:00 then get a bite , there are several nice rests with different choices ... Full of coffee shops also , so spending 3-5 hours there is easy Have a great time , I am sure you 'll repeat it again and again ... always something new to try out .

how did u know legalpad ... are u ordering from them ?
puking every time someone eats something that is unappealing to you ! How will you travel and see the world ? What did you do when you were in Australia ? Just because a place sells pork does n't mean we have to eat it or all the restaurants that cater to us Muslims will close ! <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong> I did n't drink the kool-aid ! </strong> -- <em> PM </em> </p>
For those pork lover better to try one korean restaurant in Alkhor they selling 80qr per order little bit expensive but considered as priceless 4 those pork lover aside from that you can order sum bottle of beer for 20 qr . . :-RRB- -RRB- -RRB-

You knw Alkhor stadium , just beside of the stadium wid white steel gate but theres no sign board , actually at first i never believe my frend until i experienced it wid my own self . . its little bit pricy but worth enough for pork lovers ... :-RRB- -RRB-
That reminds me of the thread about legalizing prostitution , dms . If they 'd do , it could be regulated , at least .
I mean , legally ? I could not see the parallelism about pork and prostitution except they are similar in first letter ! Lol !!! `` Do n't let a little dispute injure a great friendship ''
No I do n't mind anybody eating beef in my presence . I once consumed beef but unwittingly . It was a buffet lunch and I was having a bit of this and bit of that . I did n't check the description of the meat . It was like a kebab , I had one small piece and it felt a bit different . I went and had a look and found that it was beef . I simply stopped eating that and trashed the remainder.I did feel bad about it but it did n't bother me for long because I ate it unwittingly .
Brits ate up all the mad cows to cure the madness in them . Now all the cows are sane again !
Pork was available till 1979 ... Back in those days they used to sell piglings too . Ali Bin Ali Supermarket and Qatar Cold stores were in demand and when pork was stopped these too supermarkets lost its shine ... Qatar Cold store still exist but AL BIn ALi is no more <pre> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> -LSB- img_assist | nid = 50852 | title = hmm | desc = | link = none | align = left | width = | height = 0 -RSB- </p> </pre>
while prostitution is haram in the whole world ! Generally speaking ! `` Do n't let a little dispute injure a great friendship ''
smoke , by back in the day , how back do you mean . . maybe bfore the brits left ? . . dunno , dint expect that pork was ever available here after it was qatar . .
PM , you fell in love with a cow ! Do you eat Beef ?
You do n't have to love the meat you eat , edifis . I hate cows , but I like a steak .
Thats natural , only those who do not love the animal can eat their meat .
But you have to love the meat you eat .
I said `` I like a steak '' , edifis .
Thanks , edifis .
Yes I understand that MD. . And I do n't like a steak . I would rather let the cow live peacefully and graze around without being threatened by a butcher wanting to make steak and veal out of her .
But I like Cigars . They are the only link to my Cuban Shotputter . Why should I be made to suffer ?

The Pigs would be happiest if the whole world converts to islam .
As far as I know , Jews do n't eat Pork either . .

Thank you for being positive . I too would not be surprised .

in my poem ... i wrote . . `` but when exp ats dine '' for some reason it appears as `` but when expatriates dine '' I try to edit the poem ... and again when i looked to edit ... it says exp ats ... I am confused ...
trying caps to see the effect ...
I tried capslocking different letters of the words ... but it always comes out the same !! EXPATS EXPAT
I have also heard that there will be a pork store over by the liquor store ... I want to say I heard it from `` reliable sources '' , but I ca n't remember who it was that said it .
what 's the big deal eating pork anyway . i mean i see why people feel the need to drink . but eating pork ? pork is disgusting . it has all types of worms and bacteria . yuck ! i hope Qatar does n't allow it .
Okay , edifis , if a human body dies it rotts in the grave . It will be soaked up by the surrounding soil which allows plants to grow , which are eaten by animals , which are eaten by humans . Therefore we eat atoms which used to be part of a human .
smoking has no clear injuction wethere it is haram or makrooh , some say haram some are makrooh -LRB- makrooh means undesirable -RRB- alcohol has three stages of prohibition in the qur ` an , -LRB- there is a little profit of drinking but the damage is more than the profit -RRB- -LRB- dont pray if you are under intoxicant ei ; wine -RRB- -LRB- drinking wine is the handiwork of satan abstain from it -RRB- pre islamic era drinking wine is a social menu for the gathering . early Islam , some companion of the prophet -LRB- pbuh -RRB- used to drink wine , some of then pray even under the influence of alcohol . when the last revelation came all brim of wine were broken and the wine overflow on the street of Madina . -LRB- i am open for correction -RRB- while pork eating is clearly prohibited from the very beggining , not only in islam but in previous faith like of judaism . in some islamic state allowing this two is under a very strictiest and monitored . my opinion ...
from seventy nine , they only let wine but when expats dine , why not pork they opine ? so they said fine , have your swine but after you dine , promise you wo n't whine
just go to sleep , you might dream about it . lol
I ca n't type the word ' e x p a t s ' on QL ... it gets automatically changed to exaptriates
Yes you are , veris .
Pigs are a complex organization of atoms , chicken also , humans , too . What 's the difference ?
nice pix !
Is MD contemplating cannibalism !
Sorry ma'am ! For miss PM detractors : `` mad cow '' disease is NOT transmittable by kissing cows ! :P
yeahh . . i know that theres no way pork will b alowed . . was worried bout goin dry here . . thats the day i leave for home . .
So , if yo drink , then there is no reason to avoid chicken ...
yup only in a dream , just in a dream
Great . Then Qatar will become Expat heaven . . We 'll never have to leave :O -RRB-

Yes , it 's better to check the map . I have heard of it but I do n't really know where it is . I hope it 's a good health center because I know that some area lousy . My cousin went to many of them because she needed help . She was having some personal problems so she started to take drugs . I saw her trying to quit and I realized how difficult it must be . Luckily she went to <aÂ rel=followÂ href=http://www.drugrehab.net/directory/texas/> Texas drug rehabilitation </a> and she is way better now . I 'm very glad for her .

RTFM !
About culture : I just CAN NOT relate to most of the `` Arab Americans '' . The Gulf is where I belong , I follow Arab culture in every way . Every day I find my desire to live in Qatar multiply exponentially . I just do not like Western culture , I dont know why I was born in America . It just is not `` me '' , I just can not do anything Western , I tried once , and now ask myself why did I even try to be like a Westerner ? Everything in Western culture is backwards to me . This is not my society . Its NOT that I am `` trying too hard '' or anything , but it just comes naturally to me to be Arab , and do things the Arab way . Not every single Gulf Arab is perfect , I know this , and every country has its problems , but you have to admit , this is a beautiful , traditional country with a lot of history . And to those who said I should marry in Europe or USA , WHAT WERE YOU THINKING when you told me this ?! Not only is that illegal , but absolutely wrong . Ahhhh my difficult life ; good thing Islam prevents me from commiting suicide ...
I have heard different . Hrm . . Clarification is needed . ______________________________________________ Brazilian Jujitsu in Qatar http://iloveqatar.net/bjj/
AbdullahAlSaeed , have you considered coming to Qatar for university ? It would be a nice way for you to see the country and perhaps get a better chance at a job here after graduation -LRB- or even to meet that nice GCC girl . -RRB- Mandi
Indeed , AbuAmerican , calling PITSTOP ! Mandi
OH ! This is Abdullah ! the one with the hatred toward the West and blatantly says it ! How he hates the US and wants to live in Qatar because its a Muslim country ... mmmmm I remember you abdul me ole mucker !
Oh , can some real Gulf arab show him how to do his headgear properly ;-RRB-
later chief ! ______________________________________________ Brazilian Jujitsu in Qatar http://iloveqatar.net/bjj/
Oh dear , he 's taken offense . I really did n't think anyone was too harsh on him this time . I hate to see kids ' bubbles burst . Life has a way of doing that soon enough as it is . Mandi
eeerrr do they?lol
But thank you to those who are kind to me , and the University is a good idea . And PM , the Gulf is the ONLY place for me .
Being Arab is n't enough out here dude . These people , as good as they are discriminate amongst each other over family name and color let alone an outsider coming in . Try as you will , come here and it wont take you long to realize you will never belong . You will never be one of them . Its an elite club you are born into . These are not insults to these people , I like them very much . I work with one westerner only the rest are Qatari . I live in an exclusively Qatari neighborhood . I pray with them in the mornings and evenings and sit with them in their homes but the fact is even if I marry one , have kids and die here ... me and the kids I will produce will never be one of them . NEVER . You talk about marrying a girl from here . . Their parents know what I say is true and that 's why you will have a hard time to find one to marry and an even harder time keeping one if you do marry her . No one is trying to take anything from you man . These are simple things you need to know before you come out here with altruistic ideas and end up with an angry heart . Again , I say you should try Saudi or Yemen , these issue do not exist to the extent there that they do here . ______________________________________________ Brazilian Jujitsu in Qatar http://iloveqatar.net/bjj/
Well , you have to find a Qatari girl first -LRB- which is n't logistically easy -RRB- and then get permission from her family . Since Qatari families usually prefer to have their daughters marry other Qataris , often their cousins , you would appear to have an uphill battle . Mandi
Thank you Mandilulur , but I know the obvious ! I was asking about the law , like if it was illegal or not .
You need permission from the Qatar government in order for a Qatari to marry a non-Qatari . In the case of Qataris marrying foreigners it is certainly not automatically granted . It is illegal to marry outside of Qatar without government permission as well . Mandi
* Twilight Zone music * doo doo doodoo doo doo doodoo
Mandi , Cousin sister , cousin brother ... ... cousin wife !
muslim man can marry a muslim woman ... whats the problem in it ... ca n't understand why mentioning Muslim US man wants to marry a Qatari Woman ... ????
You have a valid point , but in this case there is no family pressure to endure . .
My friend is marrying a Lebanese . They have to get an approval from the government . Good luck !
From the government of Lebanon ?
What has the government got to do with who is marrying whom ?
No Qatari is allowed to marry a non-Qatari without the approval of the Authorities . That 's just the way it is . Male or Female .
im afraid not ... first u 'll haveto cancell her visa . -LRB- your current maid -RRB- . . then u 'll have to apply for a new approval for visa once you get that only then u can proceed further ...
no you ca n't you must first cancel her rp to get the new visa
You have to cancel first , ask the Immigration I think after canceling you can replace the old visa with new name to be hired
lwmarji if you are looking for an exception to the rule then is better to go to the authorities to get `` appropriate info '' . Regards !!
Are you planning to hire them with work visas ? If yes what will be your offer ?

This dracula conspires for young blood , dont follow him , follow me !!
lol ... too many responses for you to read through ? I have n't been to the water park but I think it 's meant more for children ... although I 'm sure you could still have a good time there . . haha . I personally have n't been to many pubs here but I really like some of the bars ... the W and Sky view bar @ La Cigale are really nice .
drac : i saw you yesterday at zikreet ... wht were u doing there , finding fresh blood ... ; -RRB-
thankyou dracula !! it was great help , i was actually looking for the information you just provided . Tailchopper , what do you mean ?? Follow you where ?? in Afghanistan ?? LOL
once the suplemments arrive into Qatar they will go to Customs and also to the Health authorities to give the clearance , then you will receive your stuff . If health authorities do not issue the clearance your stuff is simply seized and you might probably end up loosing your money . Aramex provides the facility to shop in the US & UK and bring it into Qatar however and once again upon arrival the merchandise will need the approval and clearance of the Health Authorities so you can receive it in your hands . Better call them to check if they can help you on this http://www.aramex.com Regards !!
If you have access to the `` APO '' then you will have no problems , If you need to ask what is that ... Then you must be using regular mail , and everything above applies to you .
anybody know where can i buy this dietry product , appreciate
thank u guys ...
gon na stay for 5 nights , shorter than that flight ticket very expensive .
Taxi is easiest way to get around , you will find anywhere at anytime . . Just be careful they do n't rip you off , especially if you 're a tourist ...
thanks all for the info and reply . good nite .
Taxis can be expensive , I found the bus system very affordable and easy . Mandi
Saeed - That tarnished my stay and has left a mark for me :o-LRB- OP - Amman is known as the city of seven hills , but it now spans over an area of nineteen hills . Do n't try walking !!! Make sure you visit the car museum and take a trip out to Jeraish
Do you mean Madaba when you say mosaic city ? 2 nights is too much . Stay at one of the Dead Sea resorts instead . Mandi
Hi , Mandilulur , i checked the website , it said the distance from mosaic city to dead sea is slightly more than 10km , so i think it 's still consider easy and convenient to go to dead sea , then night time back to mosaic city to rest . hotel in dead sea area are very expensive .
Saeeed , friendly , yes , except when they blow up the hotel you are staying in : o -LRB-
saeedkan , thanks for the info . any idea on car rental and recommendation of budget hotel .

Triumph and lonely ? Talk to Dani at Al Fardan . I know they organize rides on Fridays .
Villagio in the parking near the the carrefour gate on fridays . I personally dont like riding with guys here because most of them are new to bikes . On the other hand , if youre looking for a real ride around , my k6 thou is coming out of prison in a month . Hit me up then and we 'll go out with a couple of friends ... Unrelated but tell me how is the 675 in the summer weather here ? I heard it runs pretty hot .

Qatar Distribution Company . Check with Qatar Airways as it is a subsidiary QR company . Do not have any idea about salary structure
Hahaha ... guys . . let him elaborate it ...
MJ , could be right ... Qatar Design Consortium ...
They sell all of those group of drugs in the pharmacy , some you will need a local prescription for -LRB- available from a primary health doctor or specialist -RRB- but usually just buy over the counter . You are required to carry a medical certificate or copy of prescription when entering Qatar in case you get checked but as long as you are just taking the medication for yourself and not trying to import it for others you will be ok . Receiving medications of any kind by post is an absolute no . It is illegal and anything medicinal will be kept by customs -LRB- including a face mask I ordered from Elemis but I did get it back . -RRB-
You 'll need a prescription for it . You can bring it in but make sure you have a note from your doctor saying that he prescribed it for you
i do not think so ... but u can apply for tourist visa for 1 month : -RRB-
Yes you can extend till another 3 months to complete 6 Months as a total since she arrives in Qatar .
The above information is not correct . 6 Months Visit visa is only for your direct relatives -LRB- blood Relation -RRB- if its your wife 's relative then its only 3 months , and if you go request for 1 more month showing a ticket they might grant you .
It is correct . 3 mnths for indirect relation and later a month extension after showing a ticket . Go to the Main Immigration .
This NOT new rule it indeed old rules . niece or nephew is consider as direct relatives but sister in law is falls under indirect relatives of yours as she is the sister of your wife . @sms09 ... you are correct . ! anyhow you can still extend her visa of 1 month provided air ticket to the immigration officer , without ticket then sorry to say ... no EXTENSION . . Note : if u r kabayan ... then PM me . . i will tell u best solution for that .
blueeagle message sent . . pls check ur inbox . . thanks
nfiqbal , it is not a new law .
is Visit Visa is of 3 months for wife as well -LRB- the visit -RRB- visa , does wife comes under direct -LRB- blood relations -RRB- ?
for wife the visa is extendable for 6mos .
Thank you so much guys !

According to new rule , it is possible i guss . .
according to the new rule , yes , it is <b> possible </b> . Although still very complicated . does n't mean everyone automatically gets it . Only ladies on the high positions/with high educational level can sponsor their husbands . Also the nationality of the sponsor and sponsored husband is taken into consideration . And of course high salary level .
Max123 , such a confident answer might mislead and disinform people . Just curious , are you -LRB- or someone close to you -RRB- an HR specialist in Immigration laws in Qatar ?
old & new law both is applicable . good luck straight ahead toward immigration Dept and apply .
<i> Yes ... according to law , it is possible with the factor of your profession in your Visa & Salary range -LRB- above 7000 / - -RRB- . One other factor is the MOOD of the Immigration Personnel ... May Allah Help You with THAT ... : D
I was chatting to someone about cycling at the weekend . Apparently i 've done the right thing shipping my bikes out as buying a decent brand new here will cost 2-3 times as much as elsewhere . Best check with companies such as Excess Baggage Company or other freight forwarders re shipping costs . Most will send a bike boxed if you take the pedals and bars off . Do n't go to the airline direct , you 'll get ripped off .
Better to bring your one , here its expensive ...
Nice bike with gears and stuff costs more then 1100 QAR ...
Nothing here -LRB- NO THING , Not One Single Thing -RRB- here is logically priced . ALL retails deal with the thing on the basis of You are in Qatar . You 're highly paid , you have to pay more !!!
the price of nice cycle is 200 $ if you will pay extra weight jjust buy one from Carefoure
My friend have a big studio near landmark , call my friend at 5385446 . Mr Abdul Salam . He will help you for sure
Nearest to Landmark were places like Madinat Khalifa -LRB- north and south -RRB- , Dafna , Duhail , Gharafa , Al Kulaib , Bin Omran , Khuratiyat , Al Rayyan -LRB- old and new -RRB- . Good luck !
you can look in MATAR KADIM or MANSOORA or NAJMA i think NAJMA area is better for you , , , , have great day , , , , , ,
Look for Gharrafa or Madinah Khalifa
MATAR KADIM or MANSOORA or nagma ! even Ain-khaled near salwa industrial will good !! alsadd area is more convinient . so hve u just arrived in doha ?? r u cmin within days over here!doha is gr8t city to stay in ! 1 thr r places to hang out !!
150 QR per month . Mandi
wow ! that 's not too bad at all : o -RRB-
If you sign up for nine months it 's even less . And they offer over 130 classes per week . Mandi
Check your inboxx plzzx . .
The 150 QAR per month mentioned by a previous poster is the ` add-on ' price for using the gym . You have to also have paid for membership , which is 200 QAR per month . So , it works out at 350 per month . I was there this morning making enquiries . They are not accepting any new members until after Ramadan . Membership begins at the first of the month , so that means new members will be accepted from 1st October . You can attend a class without being a member . There 's a charge of 50 QAR per class . You ca n't do this with the gym though . They have spinning , pilates , circuit training , yoga , etc. . They also do guided tours of the facilities on Monday , but these wo n't resume until after Ramadan . Hope this helps .
mozzie , do you know what days are pilates classes ?
its very inconvenient and very expensive ... and they have no sense of customer satisfaction . I bought a membership and now during Ramadan the swimming is at 9:30 at night !! WHO makes these stupid decisions !!
It is permissible to swim during the day in Ramadaan . Muslims rinse thier mouth with water before prayer during fasting . there is not a single hadeeth that advice otherwise unless you 're making this up ;-RRB-
not making it up genesis . and to make matters worse , when i was living at ezdan the pool always mysteriously closed for cleaning during ramadan , so of course that just added fuel to my thoughts ... haha
Aspire Active is a governmental sport institute meant for the local community in the first place . it 's expected that the timing is adjusted during Ramadan to suit all . you can always join a hotel gym , you know ;-RRB-
include ? or rather exclude . ... and I do n't think people actually drink pool water ... Just shows how far and illogical this is all taken . .
Hi , The details of all the women 's classes at Aspire Active can be found here : http://www.aspire.qa/inthecommunity/aspireactivewomen.aspx
At Teyseer on the airport road behind the Suzuki showroom , there is a car polishing shop , philipinos , they do a reall good job , but quiet high , about a year and a half ago it was aroung 800 / - riyals ... not sure now
Al Rasheed Car Wash in Salwa - not much expensive and staff are good in detailing . Good luck !!
try `` Al Yal '' located near the mall roundabout inside gasoline station ...
al wesam petrol station in salwa road
Try `` Shabaan '' Behind Giant at Sana roundabout . Be prepared to leave your car for a couple of hours !
Love is like a chewing gum ... you can go on chewing it . The taste vanishes ... but not the gum ... lol
There is also Puppy love ...
love is like a cigarette its starts with a flame it continues in smoke and it ends in a few ashes
And we all know mens version of love for puppys lol Love ca n't be defined - it is such a powerful emotion .
` They ' are indeed but you love us anyway : - -RRB-
No one have same fingerprints and that exact rule applies in love as well :-RRB- Ma form of love is the best : -RRB-
An emotion , a relation or a situation ca n't be prefix with word LOVE ? It is Sex -LRB- kamasutra -RRB- you need , you are tough/stubborn -LRB- situation -RRB- , you have brother/parents/puppy / soulmate/self -LRB- relations -RRB- . Try and define LOVE
You ca n't ` define ' love . Define means to draw borders . Love has no borders .
type of love is only one as it generates from heart . And when it transform from heart through the means of positive emotions , regards , and affection upto the mind , then different forms of love created in love-factory of planet . So , that depends upon the best taste of your brain .
thats why i said TRY
Love comes in different types and shapes at Ramada parking lot after 9pm .
Love is something people can not fathom .
Agape
Approximately 6.5 billion types of love .
QL 's Stars Karaoke - 21 April 2011 http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1768948
Well you sure can find a few or else always get togather with friends to have something to help you pass your time out here . Welcome N good luck out here
KTVs like in Singapore do n't exist here . Karaoke bars/places like anywhere else in the world do n't exist here either . Better to find a friend with a karaoke machine and bar fridge .
Some Filipino restaurants have a karaoke setup -LRB- Conina Filipina , Royal Restaurant , Puerto Galera to name a few -RRB- . The closest KTV setup would be Filipino Cultural Center in Matar Kadeem . It a resto hang-out place that sometimes live bands would play . They also have rooms with karaoke that would cater to small groups for parties .
Fusion Restaurant ... and I heard this FFC offers them too ...
You can get karaoke machines in several shops here in Qatar with plenty of songs in a disc included . .
The English language . Obviously they do n't speak French here .
The three pin electrical socket is British and most of the standards used him from Finance to Construction are British Standards .
Cabbage , All the Qataris in my office speak English , as English is the working Language , with a exception of few Official letters in Arabic everything else is communicated and adminstered in English . Arein English may be the second most language spoken in Qatar not after Arabic but after Malayalam ? : -RRB-
QDC ... . . used to be run by British companies before Qatar Airways took it over ... Plus all the Brits that are still here ...
The also left britexpat on QL : -LRB-
Are you kidding ? This place still IS still part of the Anglo Empire -LRB- now being run by the Americans rather than the Brits but still Anglo -RRB- . Favorite sport : English football/soccer . Huge effort to get the WC 2022 here . Language : more people speak English than Arabic in Qatar . Primary/secondary education : British curriculum -LRB- or versions of it -RRB- prevails and is most sought Universities : colonies of American universities Economy : petroleum products extracted by mostly American companies , distributed by mostly American companies and used to fuel Anglo Empire and other economies . Professional class : lots of Brits and other Anglos managing everything from banks to education to infrastructure Shopping : malls are American look-a-likes packed with shops that are all over Anglo world . Whole concept of mass shopping like this indoors is American . Health : people getting obese just like in other parts of the Anglo Empire as they feast on burgers , chicken nuggets , fries and Coke . Defense : Mostly-American made weapons and a big US military presence Politics : Considered a close ally of Britain , US and other parts of the Anglo Empire . Cars : The favorite Land Cruiser is made in Toyota 's American factories . Dress : Blue jeans -LRB- American -RRB- and business suits -LRB- English -RRB- prevail . A Gap in every mall . I am not saying this is good or bad . It simply is , and personally have no problem with it .
OK I might be wrong , But was it not the British who endorsed the current ruling family in Qatar ?
Britain was not a big influence when it was a protectorate , but as Olympics wrote , a much larger influence afterwards and indirectly -LRB- via other parts of the old Empire -RRB- . I suppose it all depends on how you interpret empire .
I always use Bin Yousef Cargo - they send it via Qatar Airways Cargo . It 's quick and about as cheap as you 'll get . I ca n't remember the cost structure but I do remember comparing about 3 companies and they were the best .
I agree with Boer , I have used Bin Yousef after comparing prices and was very happy with their service and costs . 44074777

Airtel is good ... i m also planning for same now ...
Well it is not legal in qatar , however , for viewing some indian DTH here are the few choices 1 -RRB- Install a 8 feet parabolic dish with Prime focus lnb , and you can view all channels from Big TV HD 2 -RRB- normal big dish for Airtel 3 -RRB- this works best in States , but can try it is called a sling box , install one on your home town and one here , and the program gets streamed and you need only internet connection here Hope this helps
Indian DTH works but its not reliable ... take the Pehla package from Mozaic tv it will cost u Qr 400 including the Internet and Landline phone ... U get around 30 + good Indian channels . Pls Note - Once u take Mozaic tv ... u cant cancell it before completing 1 year , if you do u have to pay them qr1000 .
Install Airtel DTH . . Its clear & working well here ...
everyone for your advises . I would like to know few more things . Is Airtel DTH available here in Qatar or should i get it from India . Also , if I will get it from India , are technicians available here to install the DTH ?

There are several considerations in buying laptops and here are some of the basics . . Looks - definitely you want to have a laptop which can be mistakenly recognized as an old one , so you have to select which is the most updated and stylish in terms of appearance . Right now , most laptops are getting thinner compared to their predecessors . Also , a laptop which is small in terms of screen width -LRB- 14 inches below -RRB- is so stylish and more handy . Any brand of laptop can be as stylish as is seems depending on your taste . Battery Life - this is also a major consideration in buying laptops . It also creates a lot of inconvenience if your laptop battery last for short periods only . In my experience HP laptop batteries are far better from any brand . Just always remember that when you are charging your battery , unplug the cable once it is fully charged . If you are going to use your laptop for a longer period of time , it 's better if you plug the laptop to a regulated power supply and detach your battery from the laptop . The first two are basic considerations . Below points are dependent on your applications the laptop shall be subjected once it is in operation . Applications are graphic designs , web-designs , softwares , chatting , gaming , audio and video , emails and web-browsing , etc. . Processor - buy laptop with a minimum of 2.0 GHz speed for better outputs of your applications . Graphics - if you want good graphics , select a laptop with G-Force in it . Operating systems - Vista and its predecessor , XP is really far from each other . Although all new laptops are basically equipped with Vista OS , try on having two OS 's like XP on one drive and Vista on the other -LRB- Dualboot -RRB- , so you can be more flexible . RAM and HDD - random access memory -LRB- RAM -RRB- and hard disk drive -LRB- HDD -RRB- are also to be considered if you want higher applications . Anyway laptops right now are arriving at 2GB RAM and 250 HDD at minimums . Hope I 'd helped you on selecting a laptop . Basically , we can not really say what laptop is the best ; it depends on your preferred application usage .
Many thanks to all specially to lyndon_joseph . I suppose to buy Dell XPS 1530 .
you 're welcome . . mafi mushkila . .

If you are gay you 'll like it a lot . Its the gay area of Doha ... seriously ... its ok . Hopefully it close to your work as that is the most important thing round here .
My work 's in the West bay area . How long to drive there from Al Duhail ? Gay area ?? I take it you 're joking ?? Are landmark and city centre malls ? What is the accommodation like qualitywise - are the buildings new etc. . Cheers for the help .
Is DESS school in this area ?
Thank you all so much for your help guys . I really appreciate it . I 'm so excited to be coming to Doha in August . Got my ticket confirmation through today !! Qatar here I come !
visit u will come to wat is this area ... ...
Thats why you are a triple-X Pat !
well said edifis :-RRB- ex.ex.expat , That is why I said it depends on how one spend :-RRB- cheers .
Yes he is American , but he has Asian roots and if you know your land well , you will know that the Asians over in the West are know for having a `` savings account '' . So maybe he does not lead the `` extravagant '' lifestyle your family leads and $ 2000 may suffice for him for starters . IMHO , depending on where he worked , yes he could get more than $ 2000 in the US , but the problem over there is there is more supply than demand for the type of work he is looking for .
You SHOULD put your ideas in action rather that talkingjust go to http://www.qf.org.qa/output/page19.asp http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/index.asp?cu_no=2&temp_type=44 There is no harm in trying
Unfortunately there are a lot many job seekers who will come here for $ 2K / month . Many of the Asians see this as a stepping-stone for better prospects . Besides , $ 2K for an Asian is a lotta money .
You seem to forget the chap says he is American . Why would he come here for such a low salary ? As a stepping stone to $ 2500/month ? Another low salary . This is very low by American standards from what I know .
Would n't it be better to tell him the truth and encourage him to get a degree , rather than chase low salary half-way around the world to a place that is more expensive than where he is ?
I never told him to come 7000miles across here chasing a low-salaried job . I was the one to tell him the pay will not be more than $ 2K approx .
whatever made you think he 's not getting a degree ?
He wanted to come here for a job at one of the universities he did n't get , said he did n't have a degree and inquired about whether it was necessary .
we 're not fighting , we 're debating :-P ... Btw , he has clearly mentioned in the post that he 's completing his Bachelor 's degree in Business Administration -LRB- Management Information Systems -RRB- from an accredited U.S. College . Regarding his job , he said he almost got an IT related help-desk job at Carnegie Mellon . I do n't know what happened to that one though : - -LRB-
Well , that 's great that you have it planned out ... If I come across any help desk job that pays that range , I 'll let you know !
Hmm , not to be negative here but a young person just starting out with a newly minted degree may not have that much success here in the Gulf . Just my observation . Mandi
Rishi is correct on that one ... and that is what I have observed a lot in the Gulf ... A EU / UK / US / AU etc. passport will get you a better position with a better payscale in most companies in Doha . Another observation I made here is that , to be a secretary , you do n't need short-hand , nor do you need typing skills -LRB- min words / min etc. -RRB- As long as you 're under your husbands sonsorship , you can get a secretarial job .
This is gon na turn into the typical ` why do westerners earn more ' bashing topic which has been discussed a million times ...
In an earlier thread he mentioned that he almost got an IT related help-desk job at Carnegie Mellon ... idk what his deal is ???
Try and avoid Qatar for your first job . Will be tough for you anyway to get a job here without any experience .
it 's even tougher in the US : - P
I have that effect on you eh ? : - P
chal bhaag colt ... LOL ... im outta here guys ... G'nite ... .
Night night , do n't let Colt -LRB- oops -RRB- I mean the bed bugs bite ; - -RRB-
and if they do , beat them black and blue with your shoe -LRB- PJ that one -RRB- :-P Snessy - How 's it hanging ? : - P
Well guys I do have an American passport and Yankee accent but im Desi -LRB- originally from South Asia -RRB- + still in college here in the states . I have a few years of experience as a help desk analyst ... . . but I heard they do n't get paid as much in Doha , that 's why im still working towards my degree . Let me know what I should do ... ... ...
Complete your studies , get few years of work experience and then search for job in GCC . That 's the best way which actually works .
can you say , `` thank you , come again '' ... : - P
Finish your degree and do n't come to Qatar . Best thing to do .
if you do n't want to help the young guy , do n't discourage him . nothing is easy in this world
Having worked in recruitment for the past 8 years , I would say experience is way more important than having a degree . Saying that , we 're in Doha and perhaps your passport is worth more than your degree and experience put together . Colt ... I 'm good chick , how are you ? : - -RRB-
why did you not answer me like I did when you asked me the exact same question ? :-P Yawning my a55 off btw : - -LRB-
May God shine your heart !
africana , giving false hope to anyone is as wrong as discouraging others . We are telling him the reality here not discouraging him .
Well Colt ... I do n't have anything hanging and anything that may be hanging even a little bit is definitely not low ; - -RRB-
Would any of you guys know of any Help Desk Vacancies ? Also , do you know how much help desk techs make ? I hope there at least provided housing ... ... . I would like to make Doha my home for a few years just as an experience ... ... I only would like a decent package . Thanks for all of your help ... ... .
I 'm happy you deal well with the upliftment of the downtrodden : - P
i just expressed my opinion.i was not directing to any one.please do n't misunderstood me . God BLESS you
Colt , Cosmetic surgery can do wonders !
cosmetic surgery upto a certain extent ok ... i have seen pics of it gone bad : - -LRB-

UR DEGREE IS NT VALUABLE UR ... ITZ ALL ABT UR EXPERINCE . <b> Mod 's note : DO NOT CAPITALIZE ALL LETTERS . On the Internet , all capitals signify you are yelling and will be treated as such . </b>
Having a degree does help as to get a degree you have to go to school / college to earn it and in the process you learn as to when to use the cap locks on your keyboard and when not ... : -RRB-
you will spend $ 2000 on food , phone and transportation . Nothing left to even go to the pub with ;-RRB- You need to finish your degree mate . In one place you said you have no degree and in another you say you are working on it . Whichever is true , you need to get one before you stand a chance of making any decent money by Western standards in IT .
ex.ex.ex.y.z , are you sure 2000 $ for food , phone and transportation ? I assume teksource will not make calls to someone living on moon or getting food from Mars and Dining on jupiter :-RRB- teksource84 , it depends how you spend it but its better to complete your education first then look for something .
Not entirely true , rishi . A yank with no degree is mostly unemployable here , regardless of the accent .
epi , i was joking dear . . i have a btech in mechanical . . my immediate boss is a diploma enigneer and his boss is a brit who used to be a welder in UK , now tell me , whats the point of having a btech if i have to report to a brit welder ?
Mate nowadays the cream of jobs are taken by locals There are plenty of American Companies here like B_cht_l try getting a placement there Degrees dont mean anything to them
rishi : so it seems that you were n't joking ...
ALL ARE CORRECT ... THE SKIN COLOR , PASSPORT , AND UR LANGUAGE IS THE ONLY THINGS LETS U TO GET JOB IN GULF ... ... AND MORE IMPORTANT IF YOU HAVE ALL THIS . . NO NEED OF DEGREEE . . I M DESIGN ENGG . . AND NOTHING IN FRONT OF ABOVE CRITERIA . : -RRB-
U.S. College Degrees are Valuable in Qatar no doubt but more valuable is the US passport or your skin colour :--LRB-
I hope you 're not one of those knucklehead conspiracy theorists !
Call the police ... : D

Meaningful - You should have seen the Traffic jams before they install the Traffic Lights . Now the situation is 200 % better . Ban Spoon Feeding not Me
do n't move fast and always use indicator signal-u will be safe.charan is 2001 % correct .
What is wrong with the traffic lights in round abouts . It is really good for all drivers to get out of the round about earlier otherwise you will have wait for a long time during the peak hours .
remove all those accident prone , badly planned roundabouts . grrr ...
they should put also traffic light at jaidah bridge - dubai style .
I still rememeber massive traffic Jams at sports R/A , Mall R/A , TV R/A Ban Spoon Feeding not Me
believe me this is the only way to reduce accidents

Hi friend , you can comeback qatar after 2 years ,
Your employer issues you your work permit . Mandi
1 - Apply for a job online for any company of your interest that is based in Qatar . Attend a telephonic interview . Once you get through , your employer will arrange your work permit . 2 - Look for a local manpower consultancy and find out if they have any opening in Qatar . Apply and attend the interview by the visiting company representative . Once selected , depending on the company , you will be offered a months salary in advance with an air ticket to fly in to Qatar . Work permit will be arrange after you land up in Doha . 3 - Visit Qatar on a visit visa , use your contacts if any , advertise in local dailies or apply to situation vacant adverts , attend interviews . On selection your visit will be converted to work permit . Good Luck
what is this `` Nigerian spam '' lately on QL ??
To have a job offer , YOU must look for a JOB OPENING . To find a JOB OPENING , YOU must look for it ... To find one ... YOU MUST SEARCH for it by BROWSING the classifieds , online recruitments , QATAR company websites . Do n't get me wrong ... but I 'm asnwering the OP 's next questions ... coz this is NOT THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE ASKED THIS QUESTION .
All Apple Iphone 's are made in China .
do you want iphone made in euthopia ?
i think he 's referring to the replicas , not the original one . I 've seen them in Dubai -LRB- in the huge Dragon mall near international city -RRB- . It 's not really an iphone , although it looks like one . Chinese went creative with those and added few features , like some of them take 2 SIM cards , and I saw one that 's actually small . they 're also much cheaper -LRB- ~ 300-500 QR -RRB- . Screen resolution , software , etc is does n't compare to the real iPhone . If you 're planning to buy one to convince yourself that you have an iphone , then do n't , because it wo n't work . Otherwise it might be worth considering .

Really ?
If you really do n't want to continue the job , Write a letter of thanks cum resignation notice to your Manager .
Letter of resignation means you do not want to finish the period of contract . Then you may loose ur end of services . It is better to submit a letter stating that u do not want to renew the current contract . Good luck
Just make it nice and simple and keep it to a few lines which could also include I have had enough of working in your esteemed organization and will be moving on . If you ask them for a release letter , NOC , etc then the waiting just gets longer and gives them another opportunity to play around with you and you can never be sure they will give you what you are requesting for .

funnily enough malaysian airlines offers the best when it comes to price vs service to this destination
not funnily enough , malaysia airline does not fly to Kuala Lumpur . try gulf air , always cheaper than qatar airways and emirates
i supposed gulf air is the best choice of airline n quite budgeted for some one to travel to Kuala Lumpur . . if u need any info on kuala lumpur give me a buzz .
Gulf air was the cheapest . It transits via Bahrain .
You are under 18 means you are not supposed to be married yet !! how come you are already having a son !!!!! Sounds strange .
You are under 18 means you are not supposed to be married yet !! how come you are already having a son !!!!! Sounds strange .
For family sponsored visas , you need to show proof that the sponsor and dependent have the same family names . This might require submission of the sponsors marriage certificate and the dependent 's birth certificate . Otherwise pray that the officer who will handle your papers is kind enough to bend the rules in your favor .
LOOL feed up ur mind ! . . its not my real age . . u should ask before u react . .
Just bring your sons birth certificate when applying for the visa .

I thought this was a joke till I looked it up . Monkey nuts ! Depending on where you 're from , they 're either peanuts or pine nuts , which are both available here . Are you talking about peanuts in the shell ? My parrot LOVES these ! I recently bought some at Souq Waqif .
txs very much for your answer , its no joke really ! my cockatoo will eat the mix seed but only with the nut in the shell . its worse than a fussy child . txs again
sorry notfromhere , txs for ya reply , was thinkin more of a pet shop or supermarket near to al waab thn souq . but if thats only option then i will have to go there , txs so much . like i said shes a fussy mare lol
Sometimes you can find them in the supermarkets , especially Al-Meera . You just have to keep looking around . Maybe FFC ?
yes , the souq is the best place . Did you know that Dr Walter at Doha Vets is a bird speacialist vet ? He is great for dietry advice and check ups . I 'm sure he wo n't mind speaking to you if you call there .
1 . There is one drop point at Al-Meera West bay area , and the bin name is `` Towfiq '' 2 . Before the fire at Viallagio there is bin point at the right most part , which is adjacent to carrefour , please check with mall help desk if its there or not .
There is one inside the abu hamour petrol station , infront of Grand shopping center .
There is one in Lulu Gharaffa
There is one near The Mall . U can go there and give ur stuff , what i do all the time .
ONE AT FFC AL NASR STREET REAR ENTRANCE
Call this number for Qatar charity vehicle to collect your stuff . 33203799
I 'm very glad to read this . Happy to see there are charity works going on Qatar !
Nissan Patrol would be my vote .
No comparison between H3 and Patrol . Patrol is huge , ground clearance , engine power and fuel consumption is high . I love driving my Patrol on / off road , maintenance is not cheap but is affordable the only concern is the model you mentioned is little too old and you might be looking at 150,000 plus kilometers .
the most trail ready 4x4 with live axles and stick shift on the fly 4wheel drive . 4.8 ltr in line 6 with huge torque , heavy duty suspension , low maintenance ! that 's what you need in desert/gcc :-RRB- hummer h3 is new born and does n't have the strength of patrols
Patrol is my choice , go for it !
Go for Hummer it will be more stronger than patrol . . : D
hummer is all hype : D
I 'll also vote for Nissan Petrol . Its really nice ... Best of Luck ...
Nissan petrol is good .
go for nissan patrol because its vtec engine and very good for desert
Khanan is that how you drive ? Wind every where :P Just do a test drive in both cars and see which one you like better ... its not like you are going to go to the desert everyday . So you have to see what you are more comfortable driving .
if u choose b.w patrol n h3 ... theres definitely no comparison ... nissan patrol all the way ... ... . . h3 isnt as strong as it should have been mayb u can go n check patrol n H2 n then see which u r more comfortable in
Hummer shall be known as CHAMMER -LRB- made in China -RRB- very soon .
LOL go for NIssan Petrol ...
you really like petrol is n't it . by the way I vote for Nissan Patrol especially the 2010 model . It looks like the LC . astig !
<b> <i> ... Nissan Patrol for sure !! :o-RRB- ... . .
nissan and landcruiser r the best in sand dune but i prefer nissan patrol , i have a patrol 2004 and never got stuck in sealine or anywhere in inside there , its the best for everything . need anything about nissan or questions tell me , i have 2 nissans now one is 4 doors and the other is 2 doors < two of them never get stuck in sand dune and i prefer the 1 door lol
plus it depends on the driver how he drives there in sand dune cause there r alot of people dont know how to drive there , even if u have the best car and the drivers is not good enough , ur car will be stuck :D lol , thats why i always have my rope or what u call when u get stuck and i pull u lol i always keep it in da car to take out people out hehe . thnks

I remember teh time Rizks and Babu_rao were throwing stones at a mango tree to see if they could get a fruit to fall down . Rizks said : `` all this work , what if the mango is not ripe ? '' So Babu_Rao climbed climbed the tree and felt a mango and could tell that it was ripe . He came down told Rizks and they both continued throwing stones at the mangoes happily !
I have eaten many mangoes , Philipino , Indian , Pakistani , Australian and Thai but trust me Pakistani mangoes have the consistent taste ... It 's amazing . . These days you will find them at Muzammil Sweets -LRB- if you are coming from QTel Building towards Sword Intersection . Few meters before intersection , you can locate Muzammil Sweets on the right side -RRB- and family food center .

Sana -LRB- I know , not a fantastic designer store , but since the max . you 'll wear them is less than a year , I 'm sure they 'll do -RRB- - in City Centre By the way , Sana has great clothes for breast-feeding - pyjamas that open from the sides that you do n't have to lift up , long button-downs , cheap maternity/breast-feeding bras , etc. . Sana has every size .
Oh yeah - another great one -LRB- but much more expensive -RRB- - Mother Care in Landmark - they have a good selection and the clothes are super fashionable , and I think they too have every size .
yes sana .
thank you all ... i will check Lulu , Sana and mothercare . Thanks again

I have heard lots and lots of good feedback about the British Council . I am surprised . It is a commercial venture but the teachers are well qualified and experienced .
Alexander Language Centre on Al Waab Street . Going from Al Sadd towards Villagio Mall you do a U-turn at Al Waab Petrol Station and then enter the service road in front of the petrol station and then its the first right first left . its the 2nd villa on the right . You will see it on Al Waab Street but the entrance is from behind . The teachers there are all from British Council , Qatar Petroleum or QAC . They specialise in IELTS and do try harder . Call 4436 4425 . Its also nice and clean and modern .
I 'm not . I heard lots and lots of bad feedbacks about BC .
I wonder who gave bad feedbacks regarding BC . It 's pretty good , the crowd is descent , the teachers are fantastic , all in all if you gon na do IELTS head to BC right away
lana19 Oh dear ... you 've been trying LincolnPirate 's wrong number :-RRB- -RRB-
Yes , after 2022 .
In Govt . ? it will take a miracle !!!
Thanks for your comments . The reason I asked the question is that in western countries usually , the trend is that private companies estimate the annual pay increase of their staff by looking at government 's pay increase . For example , if the government increases the salary by 3 % , they may increase by 4-5 % . I work for a private company ; in my contract , it says the company will review the pay each year . Hopefully it means that it will only go up :--RRB- So I wanted to get an idea of how much it will go up by ? Cheers
help me pls
nothing . whats mentioned in your contract is final .
nothing . . will get what written in your intial contract !
YES , its good quality ... ilove this brand ...
OK great , very useful info everyone , THANKS :o-RRB- Will have a think about it . Wo n't get 500 quid for my old one ... but I could get a couple of hundred quid to put towards a new one . Any idea if I 'll have to pay taxes or anything if I ship in electronics ?
no need to pay the taxes only for the shipping charges ...
You guys are brilliant ! Thanks so much for all the info : o -RRB-
its better to buy a new one ...
Why do you say that ?
Thanks for that ! The reason I 'm asking is because they do n't work across the water in Europe -LRB- or at least they never used to -RRB- . Something to do with the picture / sound set up ... you can get one but not the other .
cs2009 , Yes your TV will work here , its a 220/240v 50Hz supply out here so all of your electrodomestics will be OK , However if you 've got to pay the shipping yourself I would think twice because there are some great bargains to be had on LCD   plasma sets at the moment .
Thanks Steve . My employer is paying my shipping :o-RRB- I 'll have a think about it . I only bought my current TV a year ago and it 's lovely -LRB- SONY BAVARIA -RRB- , but if there are some bargains to be had , I may just sell it and buy a new one when I get there . How much do you think a 32inch LCD is likely to set me back ? Carolyn
so if there is no problem in shipping why u stay the old one . . now a days theres a lot of good model ... SONY BRAVIA ? OH my dear u can have it in carrefour u can choose a good one ...
no this is illegal . One should request the Passport and if not given you can go to Embassy or police . Passport is property of the country issued and illegal to be hold back other by a government authority like Police for valid reasons . . -LRB- but not a Company -RRB-
Your passport should be with you and not with your company .
Illegal - as your passport is actually the property of your government
you should have your passport with you . Companies are required to give back the passport of their employees after fixing your immigration concerns and visa .
In law of QATAR its illegal !!! all company is it not allowed to keep the passport of the employee , it written in their law ... but most of them are not obeying their own law ... most of the company are holding the passport of there employee and its happening , where you will go yanee !!! to complaints them !!! where and who will help you !!! for them its fair !!! QL pls ... be yourself answering the question of others , maybe you may help them or giving a false hope pls ... DO N'T just be straight forward ok ... what u know then share it bash !!! thanks and more power ...
It is illegal but normal in Qatar !
It doesnt make a difference since you can not leave the country without an exit permit
It might seem illegal but the passport does n't serve its purpose even if it 's in your hands . Should you need to exit or leave the country , your company still needs it in order to arrange for an exit permit . Also , it 's better to let your company have it for safekeeping . There have been lots of stories or even appeals in the daily papers of people who have lost their passport while it was in their possession . In our company , passports are stored in a fire-proof safe . The staff have the option of either keeping the passports with them or letting the company keep it . Majority prefer to keep it at the company 's safe , it also guarantees that the Residence Permits are renewed on time , as it is a common practice that it is renewed a week before its expiry .
No it 's not good . Stay home , plenty of job opportunities for Chemical engineers back home in India . I heard Vedanta is hiring , try with them . Much better salaries and working conditions .
do you want to apply for the tea boy at our office ? we are offering QAR 2,500 for this position .
alright , thanks for the heads up guys ... even i was thinkin it was too low ... so , i think its time for some bargaining ... i hav around 2 years of chemical engineering experience here ... i am a bachelor , with average life style , and no drinkin habits . . wat do u think wil b a reasonable quote ?
Biggest recruiter of chemical engineers in India http://www.vedantaresources.com/
They want you to work for free ...
50K , give it a try , nothing to lose ! Actually , nothing to bargain !
hai , I am a fresh chemical engineer fed up with searching jobs for a chemical engineer fresher in Qatar.I didnt find any.salary is not a matter for me , as i am looking to gain some experience.can anuone help me find a job for me ?
Even school teachers in Indian schools earn 3500 to 4000 with accommodation and yearly tickets
Robotic engineer holding PHD Degree , got offer with 15k QR in Doha is that good offer ? thanks guy ... cheers .
Chemical engineer for 2000 ?
Messenger get more the 3000 / - in our company .
Since the Q of `` qatar '' is not capital ... I presume its just a troll ... Although it would be nice to know which Company is that ?
Arien - many newbies r offered this kind of pay ... maybe the company is just a local one ...
Tinks ... how are you today ?
I am not an engr.but i did n't start my first job in QATAR with such a low salary ...
Tinker I doubt . My office boy is paid more than that here.Eeven in India a normal customer service agent will begin with Rs .10 to 15k now a days .
free food and accommodation . If you are entitled to an OT pay and you are assured of an OT of at least 2 hours a day , I think its okay . Just remember , what you 're offered is net . Now if you can equal it there in India , why go out ?
Please let me know whether you are a diploma holder or a degree holder . Please let me know your university also .
my son-in-law is also a chemical engineer & getting around 30K here in doha
Do n't come ... it 's not worth it for that salary . Its an insult for your degree .
First of all , thanks for takin d time to reply mate , im a Btech degree holder in chemical engineering ... i graduated from University of Calicut , Kerala with a first class degree ... also hav 18 months f experience ... d company in reference here is Sarvika & Co , Qatar WLL . at the time of interview , I didnt hav much idea as to what the cost of living in Qatar would be . . and to be honest , the free food , accomodation and transport offer appeared good enough for me ... now , that so many of u guys who actually knows abt qatar have suggested to stay away frm this , I ought to do some rethinking ... i hav already sent a mail to the company regardin this and if they r not willing to stretch their muscles , then i think i wud say goodbye ... a big thanks to u all u brothers n sisters ... take care
ask for 50K QAR , maybe they 'll give you !
dont misunderstant i just talk about advisers , 2000 + + = 3000 u can demand them what u think , if they ready , ofcorse u will get .
no no , btech is not d 2 years technical course u r talkin abt mate . . a Btech -LRB- Bachelor of technology -RRB- is a four years full time degree course . . and ofcourse ths was from a recognized government institution . .
than 2000 free food and accommodation for an office boy ? How long is the working time and what is the condition of an office boy or a driver ? Who shoulder the driving license and who shoulder if the car had an accident ? After five years , will the office boy be elevated to office manager ? Lol !
do n't even bargain with them , tell them flatly i do n't intend to join at this salary , let them come up with a reasonable salary then negotiate
to those who defends this offer , and who are giving hunger and lack of jobs in India as an excuse , and saying that many companies pay that low . . all you , do not complain later about `` westerners , getting salary 10 times higher than non-westerners '' . It is YOUR choice , being an Engineer to accept a salary of tea boy or not to accept it . Thousands of indians accept such insulting offers , and 6 months later start to complain about `` westerns , getting salaries 10 times higher for the same position '' . Do not accept it ! Look for QAR .20,000 . Simple .

Ca n't say with authority but I would guess that it is best to open an account with a bank that has a presence in your own home town .
To open an account you need Salary Certificate and Iqama copy with ID copy or passport copy . Open an account with QIIB or QIB , if you take personnal loan or car loan . . there interest rate is very low compare to other banks . If you are looking for good service then go for QNB .
I believe QNB has the best banking services , but perhaps not the most suitable interest rates or offers . You call any bank for required docuemtns to open an account .
any bank will do
It is better to open the account with those banks which has your company accounts . Else , you will be charged for transferring salary on a monthly basis . ie ; suppose your company is holding an account with Doha Bank and you have opened an account with Ahli Bank , you will be charged QR .25 for salary transfer every month . The documents needed is your Passport Copies & Your ID Copy
I use both DOHA BANK and MASHREQ bank ... Doha bank is quite good in service when you want to remit your money to your home land . .
Soniya , Money remittance is not the only service provided by Banks ... I will never recommend Doha Bank ... The worst customer care ... I suggest QNB or Ahli . .
Dear , without the company letter you can only open a saving account -LRB- with approx around QR500 as a starter deposit -RRB- . All the expat require a company letter to open a current account . please give a try to CBQ -LRB- 2nd largest local bank in Qatar -RRB- ... website www.cbq.com.qa and if you require help PM and will try to assist you .

you mentioned few ... I will add another ir - Dhal Hamam Park near Land Mark Mall ...
There is a great one in MAmoura where we stay . we take our child there a lot and its clean .
lcocation please ?
Thanks ! I heard about Dahl Haman Park but not so sure where is it located . From Landmark , where should I go ? Mamoura park is also near our place , we will try that also .
coming from Doha from TV round about go ahead to Markhiya R/A , take right , while going right u reach another round about with signal light , from there take ` U ' turn from the round about , then returning towards the Markhiya R/A , the first immediate right turn , on the the right hand side the park , enjoy the time ...
Dhal Al Hammam is a very nice park , huge area , nicely planned and fun for kids . Nice picnic spot for families . Many families come there for picnic especially on Fridays .
I think when u r in a Islamic country , one needs to learn the culture and their language too ?
So ?
parents will not mind if school increased the lessons of arabic/islamic but teachers are suffering coz they forgot to increase their salaries . in international schools all teachers are getting good salary except the arabic/islamic teachers , they get less than 30 % of the other teacher 's salary , simply no fair
Yes you are right osama and I dont understand why arabic staff get paid less than other staff . It is baffling to me . Some parents have complained at the new times , especially in the younger classes because the day is too long . No rizks , I want to know how most parents feel about the longer day for their children , due to the new compulsory increase in these subjects .
Since when has the school day got longer ??? Not in our school !!!
My children do n't even have any Arabic classes . The school only offers 1 second language choice in which I chose French . Honestly I 'm a little disappointed they are not obliged to take Arabic .
lost in Qatar , I would not worry ... very few children , even in schools where Arabic classes are obligatory , actually learn Arabic ... for various reasons .
those subjects were there in the 80 's in all the schools .
My kids learned Arabic from their friends , because they spent a lot of time together at the beach and in the dunes ! It 's easy as that . In their school Arabic was a must for Arabs , but a choice for non-Arabs .
Coming from Dubai , where it 's mandatory , surprised that it is not here . My children learned quite al ot in kg1 and grade 1 , they learned the alphabet , learned how to read and write . They did n't always understand what they were reading , nonetheless I was shocked on how much they had grasped the language . Went back to Canada for a year and now no Arabic . I am seriously thinking of hiring a private Arabic teacher . I 'm sure it would all come rushing back to them .
2 hours of Arabic used to be obligatory to all Arabic speaking children and 1 hour of Islamic studies to Muslim children . Now they have introduced 4 hours of Arabic to all Arabic speaking children AND non-Arabic speaking children . 2hours of Islamic and 2 hours of Qatar History to all students . I have had mixed opinions so far from parents but heard quite a lot of negative ones . Kids are absolutely shattered come 1 o'clock .
Well , as to my experience , if you mix Arabic and non Arabic speakers who , obviously , are on totally different levels in the same class , things have to go down the drain . Plus , the teaching methods of the Arabic teachers and the other teachers are vastly different .
Ah ok Mt , it was different in the school my child used to go to .
7am-1 .30 am is my daughter 's timing and she attends one of the Independant Arabic schools . Are these Internantional schools actually going on for longer ? That would be very taxing !
It used to be 7.15 am - 12.15 pm for Early years , 7am - 12.45 pm for KS1 and 7am - 1pm for KS2 . Now its 7 - 12.30 for early years and started off 7am - 1.40 pm for KS1 & KS2 , now its 1.30 pm . Big jump for the wee ones especially KS1
It must be tougher and I do n't believe it will reap much benefits as the kids will be prolly too pooped out to concentrate much on anything let alone grasp a new language . Hope the teachers then make the classes as fun , captivating and creative as possible . . Not to mention loud nuff to snap them outta their sleepy haze !

it also depends on the area you want to live in . It looks like all of them are in the opposite sides of the city . I personally eliminated Bilal studios al asmak for the area reason . Is it somewhere on A-ring road , correct ? I simply hate this area . Zig Zag sounds better in terms of area , but again i have heard so many negative responses regarding this place , that I can not advise on it . Not familiar with Y village . . is that a compound ? building ? who is the owner ?
what do you mean `` additional charge for the aircon i.e. Qatar cool ' ? you have to pay for electrisity , dont you ? what is qatar cool ?
Craig , well done on hiring a Brit . British Standards far exceed NFPA as used here : o -RRB-
I have not visited them yet no . I 'm moving over in 2 weeks and have viewings set up . Y village seems to be my top pick at the moment . It 's developed by ramco , how are these guys to deal with ? The issue I have is the 24 month contract , it seems pretty restrictive . What if after 6/9 months I hate living there due to various issues ? Bilal is on A ring , what 's wrong with this area ? Thanks !
Sorry I believe it 's ` ramaco ' and not ramco
where is your office ? your options are in completely different sides of Doha . If your office is in West Bay , you better take ZigZag tower , as you will spend at least 30-40 minutes coming from this Y-Village -LRB- still not sure where it is exactly , looks like new development , and sounds pretty far . -RRB- and going back there . Do you need it ? I do n't like A-Ring becuase this is old bad area . Everything is old and ugly there . Simple . You need to know where our office is .
Qatarisun has a very good point . You should consider your work location . As for the duration of the contract , best to choose a place and then negotiate a deal you are most comfortable with . You do n't have to sign for 24 months but you may have to commit to at least a year . But you can try negotiating - you never know it might work .
The office is in west bay . Would it really take up to 40 mins to travel there ? That 's not ideal . I thunk I 'd like to live in a compound as I feel like there is a bit more freedom than a huge tower block . Is there anything like that in westbay ? Y village is n't even open yet as it is a new build . Does anyone know of any similar apartments in close proximity to westbay for a max of 8k per month ? Thanks !
in West bay no such prices for compounds . Not too many compunds there either . Mostly towers ... Only may be somewhere in Golf Club area , but it 's again pretty far . I think your best choice with your location and budget is either ZigZag or Ezdan . Although both of them are not the best quality , as actually everything in Qatar . At least you will be close to your office . By the way , I think in Ezdan you can rent for short term , such as 1 or 2 month . And then you will have time to look around , and find somthing that you like .
Hi , My names Craig , I 'm the MD of Mirage Properties . I 'd suggest you take a short term rent , say 1 month , to allow you to look around Doha before committing to a long term contract . Regards your choice of properties , we 've have been dealing with Ramaco properties for a number of years and can tell you that the quality is good , Y Village , once opened , will be a great compound . However , the journey to your workplace would be at least 45 mins each way , as you could n't find a compound that 's much further from your workplace . I ca n't comment on Bilal towers as we do n't deal with them but I hear the quality is good , but as most have said , the area is not the best . Lagoon Plaza or -LRB- Zig Zag -RRB- as they are known , has developed a bit of a poor reputation , mainly due to early problems with maintenance and the issue with district cooling -LRB- Qatar Cool -RRB- . Although District cooling is common in the UAE , it 's a fairly new concept here . It works well but is an additional utility cost on top of your electricity and water bills . Zig Zag is in a great location and will soon have a large mall and outdoor cafe/restaurant area -LRB- developer says will open in May but expect Sept , after Ramadan -RRB- We have apts available in Zig Zag within your budget and many landlords are prepared to negotiate on the Qatar Cool cost.As a rough guide Qatar Cool should cost just over QR5 per sq mt per month . As an example a 98sq mt 2 bed apt would cost around QR500 in total cooling charges , however some landlords will include the supply costs within the rent and leave the tenant to pay only the consumption charge , this being a small part of the overall cost , approx 10-15 % . I hope that helps and if you require further advice or wish to see a wider selection of properties please feel free to come back to me . By the way , unlike many other agents , we do n't charge you a fee for finding you a property ! Kind regards Craig at Mirage

By English speaking expats , I believe yes . But I highly doubt it 's the most read by Qataris as there are Arabic newpapers as well .
It is best read among English Language News papers .

dear abdulla , you are right there are a dozen indian languages . but the reference of `` indian newspapers '' was NOT meant to be `` total '' of all languages ... NO !!! the most newspaper with the most readershp in India is not in ENGLISH ... ... not the national language HINDI ... but a small state of regional language called MALAYALAM ... there is a newspaper MALAYALA MANORAMA ... I heard the circulation is now 1.7 million !!!!! No Indian language can beat this number In Qatar , yes , GT is the number one !!
Read mostly by English Speaking Expats
no doubt , , Gulf Times is the most read ...

http://www.hope-qatar.org/ all the details r in the site My Dear this is the site . The Director is Dr. Mrs Ciby Mathews . Get all the details ... They will take good care of your child . Cheers
But your Nationality says you are QATARI ... then whatz the issue ?
there is one school in abu hamour , for kids with special needs . . also 1-2wks back i had seen an adv about such school in classifieds of gulf times , browse their website for details .
I 'm not Qatari . DRSADIQUA - what is the name of this school ? Also , I am interested in a regular nursery -LRB- not special needs -RRB- where there is integration with normal children .
Despite all the imperfections , the numerous schools and education centers in Qatar offers us , Locals and Expats , who are contrasting and multifarious , one thing : choice .
Your profile reads you are a Qatari , and you are asking us expats ?
First we have to know what kind of education you want for your child . As Frenchies said , values / educational needs may differ .
1 . In all honesty I am not totally satisfied with the schools here , but since both my husband and I wish that our daughter should become fluent in Arabic , we have her in an Arabic Independent or `` musthakhilla '' school . 2There are deffo plenty of cons but since she is now rapidly improving in her Arabic , and doing good nuff in her subjects I will prefer to keep my complaints between the school staff and us . Suffice to say I guess that no school can ever be perfect ! 3 . Around 12,000 QR 4 . Arabic and English only 5 . Well I 'd say it 's always best to build up a good relationship with the school 's administration and always address them promptly when faced with any questions and concerns . This is crucial .
Seriously , if SA wants to know what IS now , then this is it : 1 . No school can be recommended 2 . Therefore this question becomes obsolete 3 . Current fees are between QAR 12.000 to QAR 70.000 per year 4 . English and another language of choice -LRB- Arabic , French , Spanish , etc. -RRB- 5 . Administration should involve parents much more . Currently there is just a drop-off and pick-up service the parents are involved in . All together : the school system in Qatar is Stone-Age and a SHAME for the so-called ` Richest Country in the world ' !
Furthermore , subject teachers should have AT LEAST a Masters Degree in their subject and should be continuously be trained ! That should , however , go hand-in-hand with an annual increase of salaries . As it is now , education is cheap in Qatar . Cheap in the sense of low quality . All there is are expensive buildings !
you are new here . I have been here 9 years now . for 9 years my children have attended a school where there are over 67 different nationalities . There are muslims , Christians , buddhists , hindus and even jews there . They all exist in peace and mutual respect . What school ? - The American School of Doha and NO ONE has ever tried to indoctrinate my children into anything . All they have done is provide them with an excellent educational and a taught them global citizenship . Do n't talk of what you do n't know please . Our family values are still very much in tact .
Yes , the ASD . But how many students can it accomodate ? 50.000 ? What about the poor ones ? What 's the fees again ? 60.000 or 70.000 all together ? So , we have one school in Qatar . It 's occupied by children of oil company employees and a few Sheikhs . What about the 90 % other children ??
Schools indoctrinate ? Which ones ? Maybe the Qur ` an Schools .
They are going to get this thread whacked too ... poor brother straight Arrow and his vision to make QL best for all . Guys have pity on him and let him accomplish his mission . . please no religious arguments now !
1 . None 2 . Same same 3 . 20.000 to 70.000 4 . English 5 . Leave Qatar

We were taking late dinner experienced the earthquake at our sixth floor dwelling . The building swayed for few seconds & distinct sounds were noted as type of slowly diminishing pendulum movement .
Are the buildings here especially flats earthquake proof ? I do hope that in this part of the world where this seldom happens they consider it .
yes we felt it in Mushairib Towers 11th floor and it was horrible and not slightly trembling as others says , i do not know why Qatari media still silent about it ???
Very high impact in Pakistan at 7.3 rector scale . People outside on roads . Pray to Allah .

And there is one called '' events '' in Royal Plaza 2nd floor ...
I need a shop that have themes supplies ... Not just a shop to buy some baloons from it : -LRB-
Thank you for your reply ... Would you please tell me how to reach to Party Kingdom ? Where is it located ?
http://partymaniaqatar.com/ Party Kingdom is -LRB- correct me if i am mistaken -RRB- just off the Jaidah Flyover . If you come from the Salwa Road , pass The Centre , pass small roundabout . Instead going up to Jaidah Flyover , you go on the roundabout under the fly over . Turn left on the roundabout , drive all the way till to Manai Roundabout and make a u turn . After you make a U turn , just befor you reaching back the jaidah fly over , on the right there is small shopping complex that call Al Nasrallah centre or something like that -LRB- not too sure -RRB- . You go inside that complex you should see Party Kingdom on the right .
you are most welcome Tareq ...
go to Al Rawnaq in Souq or in Bin Omran Town Center . aslo in Villagio , i forgot the name of the shop but its located near in front of Carrefour .
Have you tried ELC at Landmark among other places , or Royal Toys in the parade of shops between the Race Course and Hyatt Plaza lights -LRB- on right heading in that direction -RRB- . Alternatively what about getting a small paddling pool or inflatable boat and using that . And never forget , you 're in the dessert , look around the whole country is a sand pit !!!
OMG ... like selling refrigerators to the Eskimos Plenty of sand here , get a carpenter to put 4 planks of wood together if your husband can not do this . If you look for plastic . . hmm guess online only not aware of any shop here
Thanks for the comments fo far . Sand of course is not the problem ! Wanted a plastic pit , saw one in the shape of an animal and just wondered if anyone had seen one . If I 'd wanted to build one out of 4 pieces of wood , I 'd have done that before asking the question , but thanks anyway !

It works out cheaper if you rent for a day . . ie u had a crowd to go with . . There is shop on the way to measieed and after wakra in the petrol bunk that rents out jetski and beach buggy .
U can go sealine beach at Ummsaid , jetskies price ranges are 400 - 600 ,
If you hire from the people near the Intercon beach please , please stay away from the sailboats . Some idiots were weaving in and out of the boats last week and actually knocked some kids out of their boat . I would n't be surprised if those poor kids never want to set foot in a sailboat ever again .
Check with your Bank they can give you the right answer which will depend on your monthly salary and the time to pay the loan .
check with mushriq bank
Each bank has its own loan requirements . It will be based on your salary package , letter from company/sponsor , etc. . Visit 2 - 3 banks to compare the possibilities .
check with the bank they might like your smile and do away with the other unnecessary stuff .

How much do you want ?
Very good money , but they 're not recruiting at the moment !
Why do n't you ask the headhunter yourself ? All I can say is that the oil-gas sector are among the , if not THE best employer in Qatar in term of compensation . However I heard rumor that among the multinational oil co 's -LRB- the like of BP , Shell , ConocoPhillip and Total -RRB- Maersk pay scale is somewhat on the lower side of the scale . As with other rumor , I do n't know whether this one is true or not ... Cheers SK
No its a longterm position , are the perks in line with other western super majors .
PM me , Rigpro
we like to share informations here
All Maersk staff sign a contract stating that they can never discuss nor reveal their pay not even to their colleagues as the remuneration is personal to holder - so you will not be getting anything . Their HQ is in Denmark , the country with one of the highest income in the world . . the fresh graduate there earn 4k euro above . many of the staff come from their Europe operation so I doubt that their pay is on the lower side
Any chance that you wold pass my C.V along to H.R ?
If you want a job , apply through their website : http://www.maerskoil.com/Career/Pages/Career.aspx If you 're up to it , you 'll be recruited , if you 're not , you wo n't .

I love spiders , snakes and ants , specially when they harass the shit out britexpat ... <imgÂ src=http://logo.cafepress.com/8/2817834.5660348.jpg> <imgÂ src=http://logo.cafepress.com/8/2817834.4555008.jpg>
In doha the sighting of anything other than geckos is rare but will increase as urbanisation continues and the reptiles become familar with the new habitat . There are several excellent books on snakes of Arabia , however , you are only likelty to see them if your adventurous and in the desert . A few venture into grassy areas but they are generally the harmless ones . Scorpians are poorly research locally and here generally hide by day and are quite small so are hard to see . Using a UV light at night is a good way to find them as they are flourescent !! pretty cool . Again more liklely to see them in rural areas or on the beach . On spiders your likely to find a few harmeless fella around the house , but dont be to hasty to get risd of them as they keep the flying insects in check , same as gecko . In the desert the camel spider is a mean bugger if you get bitten but then you have to be pretty thick as their `` cave '' and web is pretty obvious .
we like camping and are hoping to go camping in the desert ... would this be advisable with the scorpions etc ? Gecko 's and lizards we can handle , in fact we have always wanted one inour house ! But anything with more than 4 legs ... YUgHH !
LIZARDS , okay they are small . but one of them pooped in my kitchen jar . i killed it with broom stick . i shut another one in my door , by accident . but well it was more of good thing really .

lots of comments from various frens . . but guys and gals . . this is true as lots of frens describe here also . . i also came to know from my frens that some of the QP senior staffs are also been deported . . so be careful ...
I commend you for your stand . How much do you want for the car ??
Wonder if that has anything to do with whats happening ???? `` Your born , You Live , You Die , given this premise , one can conclude since we have no control over when we are born and when we die , the only thing that matters to us should be how we live , simple really ? '' Mis-Cat to her philosophy Lecturer .
Like I said earlier , I heard that both Christians and Hindus had been deported , and that the reason given was that they were trying to convert others . I think everyone knows that non-muslim , monotheistic religion is tolerated in Qatar , but within boundaries . For example , the churches have been told they may not erect crosses . It seems obvious that if the churches are n't allowed to display crosses , then it 's probably forbidden to display crosses , fishes or any other christian symbols on your car . I think most people also know that trying to convert people is a BIG problem here . Apostasy for a muslim carries a death penalty , and encouraging a muslim to convert to another religion is both cruel and stupid . If a person makes a complaint to the police about religious activity it will probably be investigated . To avoid trouble , do n't carry religious literature around with you . Do n't engage people in a conversation about your God unless you know they share the same faith . Do n't discuss someone else 's God unless you know your audience wo n't be offended . For Christians , especially evangelical ones , spreading the good news is part of their religious practice . That practice places people on a collision course with the local authorities . Some people will take the risks on board , and continue to proselytize , but they have no reason to complain when they get kicked out of the country . It is unreasonable to sympathize with those who have been punished for proselytizing , when their activities are risking the lives of those they seek to convert .
Well said ngourlay .
i agree with u ngourlay . , Emad = >
hmmm . . and why would they do something like that ?? for fun ? : S and by-the-way . . this doesnt make any sense at all ! -- > `` making gathering and praying jesus , worshiping god or else . . they are also checking if any cars have any kind of stuffs related with religions . . '' , Emad = >
be carefull
There is no such a thing happening in Qatar because Qatar is an Islamic country and in Islam its forbidden to block access of people for praying or worshiping there God regardless there religion
mmmmm I did wonder britexpat ... maybe ` churches to go ` should warned ...
He probably does , gypsy , like everybody here does , too . But laws of physic also apply to him like to anything in the universe . So , be careful .
If you allow a church to be built in Qatar , then you pretty much have to assume that people are going to worship in it ... regardless of what the mullas say ... the Emir allowed it ... <p> `` if you do n't like the heat ... get out of the kitchen ... but stop trying to fan the flames before you leave ... it will burn you on the a ** as you go through the doorway ...

Apple , where I come from , bible study is performed by a group of people who study the bible literally as written , it has nothing to do with Christianity , we call `` Jehovah witnesses '' , they use the old testimony , do n't think that by attending that meeting , you will have an idea about Christianity , its a sect , not a religion . They meet to read the bible , and explain it without going into spirituality and stuff ... Their main objective is to attract you , they do not believe in Jesus as we Christians do . Anyhow , I believe I went into too much details , its up to you to accept them or not . Also , people are free in their believes , I do n't consider that we should express it through gadgets , or crosses , or ... Just pray , and believe .
Xena : I guess this is not about churches but more about prayer & meditation gatherings done by people of other faiths .
u meant vijay ?
Jehovah Witness are different from Born Again Christians , the latter do believe in Jesus . But they dont believe with popes , and the saints , and they dont believe in such kind of stone image of virgin mary or any saints , they dont even believe that Jesus was the one in the picture with long beard and to my surprise they dont believe in Christmas day was the birth of Jesus ? At least that 's what I learnt meantime :-RRB- -RRB- Jehovah Witness ? am not sure , never attended yet to any of their gatherings ...
alot of these gatherings goin on in Qatar . Does it mean they have to be careful from the CID to get deported too ? P/S Arien , its YOU who 's hijacking the thread my dear , were talking about religious gatherings in Qatar , but you are talking about me :-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- lol !
Do we have a licence for the Dhow trip , charan . OMG !
MD - I said religeous and political gatherings not social gatherings :-RRB- Ban Spoon Feeding not Me
Religious , political , social . Wait until I meet you . I will try to convert you to a normal person . Is it allowed ?
Heard people who are being deported for having prayer/meditation meetings . Well , Qatar has not exactly promised anyone freedom of worship , as far as I know ... So you wan na stay here ? Chuck ur religion -LRB- except those ` allowed ' by the authorities -RRB-
MagicDragon - `` I will try to convert you to a normal person . '' Even my mother gave up that long time ago :-RRB- Ban Spoon Feeding not Me
Does this mean I have to take my neon Jesus off my dashboard ?
You should do that anyways , gypsy . It might turn into a bullet in a crash !
I 've heard from a reliable source that there have been recent deportations of both Christians and Hindus . The reason was proselytizing .
who care whom u worship inside your home ? but in the car ... hmmm i dont know ! anyways , i really doubt its for real ? lets hope its not .
Most of my Qatari friends go to `` churches '' . There they have parties with alcohol and whores from Bahrain and Marocco . Funny that they call these guesthouses `` churches '' .
Maybe in such a case they will deport people , but if someone just practice their own religion in their own home/privacy , why to deport ? they can not expect to hired all Muslims ? Like in my case , there are some born again friends who tried to invite me for a so called Bible studies . I told them i 'm cool with that coz it does n't cause me any harm and I 'd like to understand their beliefs . But next time I 'm inviting them in my religion too to understand mine . Why ca n't we just live and let live ?
Saudi is an exception :-RRB- Anyway in saudi no one stoping you to worship your god in your home !
Ohhhh , ok so next time I see a religious gathering in the City Centre ... I 'll think Uh-Oh ...
football is the new religion ... i will take down my footie scarf NOW ... thanks
guys NOOO ! there is nothing to be aware of : S. . this guy who posted the thread is not even sure if its happening for real ! and i guarantee u all that its ok to practice ur religion no matter what ur religion is . . its part of the islamic rules that no one has the right to force u to believe in something u dont want to believe in and every single human being has the right to choose his/her own religion :-RRB- no need to make a big fuss about it ! , Emad = >
Well , he was a Hindu . . And as u knw there are no temples in doha . . he used to have weekly prayers at his place with his family frenz and relatives ...

Your comment is not for me , apologies for this . But I think its just like hanging a small Qur ` an or a `` mishba '' in our car , we felt protected . Its part of their belief .
ahh hmmm wait ... let me check Mr. Webster ; -RRB-
I 'm not sure with others , but if you ask me as a Muslim ? ... sure I can relate with you guys . I still feel its very injustice to deport anyone due to religious belief unless he/she tried to convert any Muslim in that country coz just like Ngourly said , he/she will put someone 's lives at risk by doing that . Though , personally I have no problem w / someone preaching and trying to convert me coz I have my own faith which is strong in I believe . So long the person who preaches me wont stop me from practicing my own belief , then I 'm cool with that .
because there are factors that makes me skeptical of the people convincing me . I 'd rather more likely to be convinced on the testimony of one person 's life.That is practicing your faith in your daily life . For me by just reading the bible literally , does n't make me see God . But I can see & feel God through people , ordinary people . I think that 's the real essence of being christian or being one that believes there is only ONE GOD , ONE CREATOR.He maybe called in many names depends on which part of the universe we are , but I guess HE is still the ONE .
I was serious to answer you too . I am putting a small Qur ` an in my car because of its content . In my belief some aya 's and doa'a in it will able to help me shoo away shaytan and be safe travelling . Do u mean I should n't believe it or does it makes me shirk ? Kindly enlightened me ? Tnx : -RRB-
So Apple , dont you think that reading while you drive to protect yourself is a bit of a contradiction ? You dont need to memorize them all , there are specific ayas and duas as you said , and if memory serves me correctly , you recite the Ayat al Kursi for safe travel . ____________________________________________________ `` Diplomacy is the art of saying ` Nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers ''
OK , so I am trying to get a definative answer . You said you keep it in the car to protect you , then you said you keep it because there are some ayas and duas to read to keep you safe . YOu said you keep it because you cant remember these ayas and duas , so logically to use them to keep you safe while driving you would have to be reading them right ? Means I still have got no clear answer why this protects you in the car . ____________________________________________________ `` Diplomacy is the art of saying ` Nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers ''
What I mean is if you publish these kind of thing is QL , some one can approach you with bad intension .

It will be a good idea , if implemented but I will personally suggest it should be 22 yrs . I have seen very young drivers driving Land Cruisers like a plane and they think like the others are like ants on the road .
the gossip we are hearing from almost 1 years . but it 's not so strong idea . because the young people will drive without license if they not provide at 18 years age . than it will be more problem for them as well as for us . better give them correct driving skills so that they will be careful as well as all of us . most of the reckless driver -LRB- young -RRB- you see on the road are having license after 1/2 or more years their driving without license !!!
The only thing that can stop these reckless drivers is more radars and to increase the number of black points to 5 or 6 when they exceed the limit set on the particular street .
Do not forget higher fines for traffic violations . The one thing that seems to open their eyes is a heavy drain on their pocket books
Hope there was some system to confiscate the car of the reckless driver , and should be given a smaller car to drive for some days ... Even I wondered how it would be if some policemen are deployed to survey the road -LRB- drive thru a strech of road -RRB- along with cameras , in smaller civilian cars to see and catch the culprits easily !

are you asking about homeopathy , ayurveda , cupping ... etc. ... you may find cupping therapy , but it wont heal a broken/fractured leg ... the others are not available . may be you could explain your question better to get the right response .
I guess he is looking for the Ayurvedic treatment for the broken leg , I am not sure weather you can find a ayurvedic doctor here . I didnt see your profile and I dont know what nationality you are , any how back in Sri lanka there are so many Ayurvedic doctors for fracture related treatments . its quite unbeleivalbe the power of herbs . I my self fractured my leg and it was treated by an Ayurvediv doctor . Recently my son all of sudden who started limping and we found out that one of his legs is longer than the other and tried with many doctors -LRB- we call it english medicine there -RRB- and many XRays , MRI 's and tests and so on but no body could even diagnose the problem . Then it was Ayurvedic treatment , The AW dr Said it will take some time and your son has to be admitted in my hospital I agreed and we stayed exactly on month . Again the miracle of herbs with gods willing he was cured and he is perfectly alright now . sorry it must be boaring , any how its magic of Ayurvedic medicines

join a group of photography enthusiast and you 'll be able to learn not just basic course ... try this ... http://www.qatarliving.com/group/qatar-living-photography
Education . . if you find one , please let me know . . my husband and I would love to join !!
I really need to start charging for my courses - I could make a fortune ! QL have a regular informal get together every second Tuesday where we take pictures and chat about photography . Last week I gave a small group a lesson on the basics . I suggest as a start point you join the QL Photography group and search through it 's topics as there are some good links to photo basics there . Click here : http://www.qatarliving.com/group/qatar-living-photography And on particular , click here : http://www.qatarliving.com/node/226360
Well ... all i can say is photography is all about creativeness and a few camera parameters to keep yourself well aware of . I bought my first Canon Powershot SX100 IS and shot a few really amazing photos just by reading the manual . Most people who are unable to use a gadget properly are either sick of reading manuals or careless enough to use it in `` AUTO '' mode . A camera has 4 main parameters to adjust while taking pictures of subjects in different light and movement conditions , viz : Shutter Speed , ISO , Exposure Time and Aperture Value . Read about how these parameters work together on the internet and you 'd know how close you 're to becoming a photographer . Joining a course to master the skills sound ridiculous to me . The choice is yours anyway . Cheers !
Buy Philips , Sony , Hitachi , Panasonic but DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG . Samsung TVs will not support you for more than 1 and half 2 years . I do agree , nothing matches the picture quality but it is good if you are planing the TV for a short term .
If you 're in the market for a big screen television like 50 50-inches and above -- then i 'd suggest plasma as a safe bet . Plasmas give you more bang for your buck at the big end of town , and while LCDs can give you better resolution , plasma still has the edge in terms of picture quality . One other thing to look for , whether you opt for plasma or LCD , is an integrated tuner -- many TVs still have analogue tuners , which look pretty terrible on a large screen . Try to get a model with an inbuilt HD tuner if you can . At the smaller end of things -LRB- 15 '' to 42 '' TVs -RRB- , LCD is the only way to go if you want something slim and tasteful .
I would go for LCD
LCD hands down . In almost everyway , lcd wins , it is superior . if movies look bad on satellite , it the decoders fault . You might also look into NOT USING COMPOSITE CABLES as they make it useless to own a HD tv . use vga , dvi or hdmi . Using a component cable for a hd tv , is worse than buying a ferarri , without any gas . yes its that pointless .
LCD is a better choice .
i go for plasma . unless you will be using the blue ray or blu ray recorded then you may able to watch the most cosmetized picture of all . LCD may give you the clearest picture of all but as far as true color realism is concern for me plasma is the best .
First try to insert different CD and check if it will give sound . If it does , try to remove your cd rom from your laptop to check it . Try to clean it as well using the cd-rom cleaner disk .
careless user that 's why sound 's coming ... ... ... . . if u have warranty card why u dont bring ur laptop to the service center stated at the warranty card.to check when the sounds come .
Mostly the CD-rom makes sound when its corrupted or when you put a corrupted CD inside . so please try to change the CD and see how it is . . if the laptop is underwarrnty then please take to service center and get it fixed . its really tough to replace the CD-rom drive if its not under warranty as its internal part and tough to find the replacement with same size . .
what is the model of your laptop ? if your cd-rom can detach from your laptop . . do it . but remember to turn off your laptop first before you do that . . after you detach it from you laptop . open your laptop . then turn off again . put back the cd-rom . it works to me . . try it . good luck !
Does it make noise all the time or just with a certain CD ?

A big Yes 24X7
any duty free shop not operating 24 hours ???
of course ... ... no worries about that .
ur next question will b wht r the timings of airport ...
You have n't stated is it the international school or girl 's school however both do n't have a good reputation especially the girl 's school . They are not good to their staff , have loads of after school meetings that are n't productive and a waste of time . Teacher 's could use that time more productively for class prep etc.Salary depends on your nationality . If I were you I would n't accept a position their !
I was a student at Cambridge until 2009 and dunno how the situation is now but I can honestly say it was one of the worst schools at that time The student behavior is horrible . So horrible that they had to bring in like 10 security guards and put in cameras all over the school The teachers were mostly indian with a couple of english in high ranking positions but head of security -LRB- an arabic lady -RRB- was basically ruling the school.Even the teachers were scared of her . This is obviously a students perspective from two years ago so dont take it too seriously If i had to list all it 's faults the character limit will be passed
u r treated like a slave der , u have loads of work plus u dont get any dignity der.CISG , TCS and DMIS are run by poor management.u can be thrown and put any were , any place and they make maximum use of you.so be careful before accepting any offers from dem
Thank you all for your advices ... You scared me actually ! I thought that it was a good school since it 's `` Cambridge '' !! It 's surprising that most of the stuff are Indians ...
Do NOT go there , a close friend of mine works there so I get all of the stories all bad ones , the Indian regime , the attitude is horrible , if you have been offered a job there then you are highly likley to be offered somewhere else , the cheapest possible air fare home routing through Dubai overnight , the delayed salary in July , paid in September so you will return etc , etc , etc
There are a lot of schools who use words like `` Cambridge '' `` Oxford '' `` American '' `` British '' `` International '' I can open a school called the International New York School for Fine Arts and none of those words have any relationship to the type of school I operate . Good for you for asking here first .

Salam stores near City center sells Canon professional cameras ...
As nomad said , the photo section of Salam is the Canon dealer here , though other stores stock stuff as well . However , prices of photographic equipment seems to be very expensive in Qatar . Better to order it in from abroad .
just check the alpha series from Sony in 51East near Jarir bookstore
and wats tat pic for ?
is dat yr bro 's work experience in the pic ?
Saw the picture earlier in depicting team work . It is pretty cool . As for the visit visa , i have no idea . Thought people leaving Qatar get 2 year ban . . Not too sure though .
rizk you will not understand dont scartch your head you dog head .
If its a fat bugger like Rizkz either in front or the back , all three would have plunged in to the ditch :-LRB- so bodyweight also counts in team building ??
nice pic . . hope som1 will giv u a gud advice
Did your brother get a NOC -LRB- certificate or letter ? -RRB-
previous employer assured him get the NOC , but the question is he is not coming for employment , he is coming to visit me only under my sponshership .
Salam IQ755 , Send an official letter requesting them to issue an NOC letters to apply for family visit visa under your sponsorship and to exempt him from two-year ban -LRB- in case your brother was employed less than 2 years -RRB- . Attached your passport and RP copies ; and so his passport and RP cancellatin page copies . Further , there is no harm if he will be backed here for visit or work or whatever legitimate purpose he intents . It 's a basic human right to earn his living or conduct his private legal business . No one can bar you from that so just be honest with his previous employer to avoid a can of worms . Knowing Technip , I do n't think they will hold any issue against your brother for his visit or work again here in Qatar unless your brother has a lingering bad reputation . Hope the above helps .
Assalaamualaikum wa Rahmatullah : sixroomvilla . Thanks for the good advice . . means i have to send a letter to his previous employer requesting for NOC for visit visa under my sponsership . Right !!

You can apply online for a Visit Visa , for any nationality . In fact , all nationalities now have to have a Visa prior to entry . Used to be OK for Commonwealth , then they changed it to only New Zealand , and now , even the Kiwi 's need a Visa . I can tell you , whatever you do , DONT try to take food in , as they are extremely strict . Another trick to avoid huge delay 's at the airport is to declare something . That way , they are happy , and will , relatively speaking , leave you alone . If you dont declare things , and get picked out for inspection , you will be there for ages . Love my country , but it is a total pain travelling to and fro , even as a citizen . And , Qatar does not have an Embassy or Consul here . You need to go to the near useless Embassy in Abu Dhabi , UAE . Three times I have tried to get very simple things done , and all three times failed .
I would love to visit Australia some day INSHAALLAH .
you can go and check in thursday friday souq there is one shop there but dont remember the name ... ... ... ...
check in thursday fridy market
Its a few thousand KM away from Doha City in Kuwait and UAE !

Toys r us and there are many shops around Doha . Near mordern home and Najma
The old Toyota Cresida ... in running condition ... I even know of a guy who got a car for QR 500 ... a very old car ... but the guy was a mechanic ... so he can manage the car .
Just before Cube roundabout , pull into the sliproad before coming from Center , my husband got a mountain bike for 260QR brand new and it 's still going 3 years on ! There is a strip of shops , drive around the rounbout a few times and you will see . My H also had a problem with a buckled wheel , his fault a year later , and they fixed it for free . Very nice men . PM me for details , he is out at the mo. .
on salwa round , between decoration and jazeera roundabouts .
is the name actually . It is directly on Salwa road on the right hand side if you are going toward decoration roundabout from the old fort roundabout
or if you want to have a customized one ... visit the one fronting Souq Najada -LRB- the mobile phone souq -RRB- back of REGENCY HOTEL ... just 50 meters away from ARAB ROUND ABOUT , fronting the BIG GREEN TOWER MOSQUE ... at the front of it . . you can only notice bicycles for kiddies ... yet inquire inside ... there you may see many kinds ... from mountain , racing and ladies and chinese bike , also the attention grabbing triwheeled bicycles are there . there are adults bikes ranging from a starting price of QAR700 .00 <aÂ href=http://s185.photobucket.com/albums/x25/casabella1434/?action=view&current=sheep.gifÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x25/casabella1434/sheep.gifÂ border=0Â alt=Photobucket> </a> ~ ~ Life 's Cycle ~ ~ ~
Go down Salwa road passing decoration round-about going to Industrial area you will see a KFC on the right hand side , on the opposite side you will find Skate Shake they have very nice bikes . I bought my Trek mountain bike for QR1500
Depends on the company . But I doubt if the offer will go through .
whats the comparison between pregnant women and idiots ??? LOL : -RRB-
Speaking as a pregnant woman , sometimes we can be idiots . Around the third trimester you 'd forget your own head if it was n't attached to you .
I think its not a problem , but she will not be elgible for meternity leave before one yr ...
Normally pregnancy is not looked as a hindrance . Esp in the govt sector here in doha . But better to mention orally before the tests go through . Honesty never fails !
Looking at it from an HR point of view , she 's not a good investment . First of all she 'll have to take quite a bit of time off in her first 9 months -LRB- for doctors appts . sick leave , etc -RRB- as well as 54 days of maternity leave , and the likely hood of her coming back to work is slim . I would n't hire her .
As per experience , yes it will surely affects her job offer . I am one of the recruitment officer in one of the govt offices before , and its one of the policy that they ca n't hire a pregnant women even in some govt & private offices that i 've known . Their reasons : 1st , they will thought that you will be going to file your long day leave upon delivery or often to file a leave during pregnancy . 2nd , they will probably thought that you can not exert ur best effort in doing your job because usually pregnant women feels so many body changes , body pains etc , and sometimes some superior are hesitant to give work load to their staff if she is pregnant . 3rd : ur medical results will be stamped as UNFIT to work if found out that your pregnant ... So the best thing , if your planning to look for work , dont get pregnant , but you can get pregnant if you already hired or started to work -LRB- bec . that 's 2 different case -RRB- ...
Even with the smiley face that is harsh prism :-p , not true for many many pregnant women , but mm is right too . Anyway , even while being pregnant and hormonally on a roller coaster , pregnant women can be extremely active and bring good results on the work front . Coming to the op , if the medical is already over , then nothing really to worry about , except probation may go longer , once they know the employee is pregnant . If medical is not complete yet , and if the candidate is really required by the company , then a temporary job offer may be presented to her , and only when she returns back from her maternity leave , will her job become permanent . It all depends upon their hr policies .
agreed with Arlene advised , its all country ruling not to hire pregnant unless nobodies qualified for the post in the country or the applicant is a scientest .
I wish her all the best ,
han19 ... I didnt mean to be harsh ... just stated reality from a corporates POV ... for idiots I think there is no issue ... for pregnant women coming on board afresh , other women have already elaborated on it ... and smiley was just to soften the pinch of reality ... :-RRB- But still if it sounds harsh my apologies to whomever it may concern , as it was unintentional .
If she receives a job offer letter and later gets turned away , then she may file a claim for discrimination . I do n't know if that can go anywhere in this legal system . But if she gets hired , her employer will have the right of putting her under unpaid leave , during the 50-day maternity leave period . For more details , read Art. 96 of the Labour Law -LRB- see below -RRB- `` A female worker who has been employed by an employer for a complete year shall be entitled to maternity leave with full pay for a period of fifty days . Such maternity leave shall include the period before and after the delivery provided that the period following the delivery shall not be less than thirty five days . ''
2012 Olympics , I have worked as a recruiter for over 14 years and I can witness how women can be far more productive during their pregnancy .
Maybe they can . But your view is not the view of most employers here .
In my similar yrs of working under , along side and in supervising capacity didnt see or hear anyone of them being as productive when they were not pregnant ... the toughest ones were those who had the hobby of getting pregnant -LRB- every year -RRB- ... finding someone to delegate for them used to be a big challenge for understandable reasons .
Well , 2012 Olympics , the way you wrote your previous comment made it looked more like your own perspective AS an employer . Testing an applicant for pregnancy is nothing but an act of discrimination . I can not argue whether is legal or not in this country , but is just my humble opinion on this particular issue . Prism , I know what you 're talking about , but it 's a matter of education and culture and companies would need to enforce a strict recruitment control , ensuring that all applicants go through proper channels and procedures . We all suffer the same not only from pregnant women but also from male slackers who will keep calling-in sick almost every sunday or thursday for no apparent reason .
after the medical check-up they will inform to the employer and it 's the employer decision . if the employer is ok with that , they have no problem to accept you and process your papers
for any cricket gear ... call Mr Mohd Sabir on 5313049 The the main guy who supplies to all cricket in Doha Qatar , mostly all products are good quality and made in Pakistan , very resonable his home shop is behind Olympic sports the tennis balls you are looking for , he has them and he also supplies them to the local league matches
the ones that u are looking for are called MRI i believe ... red in colour !
Check in Sports corner or centre -LRB- I don remember exact name of the shop but its starting with sports -RRB- near the sword signal . Heavy tennis ball was available there . I bought it from there b4 1 month . might be available now
all sports shop sell tennis ball but for cricket use a black masking tape on the ball to make it heavy
I did the same , after I came back from vacation and went in for renewal of car registration I had to pay a penalty for paying the fine late , I had to pay some sixty riyals extra other than the fine which was five hundred , so better sort it out as quick as u can , good luck
thanks for your reply ... i had a stupid violation `` i didnt turn my light on in cornich at night '' and when i was caught the police told me of a 300 QAR fine but when I checked it online , it was 1000 QAR . some guys said I can asked the police to change the fine but I dont have much time and I dont know where to go so I just leave it . Now I am charged 1000 QAR . Will this give me any problem to get my exit permit ?
If you are thinking of challenging this fine then , wait until you comeback from your trip . Otherwise it take only a few minutes to pay the traffic fine , please settle the fine before travel and be free for all worries .
If it is the Red signal jumping -LRB- QR . 6000 -RRB- it is better to pay and visit . Otherwise , for smaller amounts , they will allow you to go out of Airport , YOu may pay later
Too expensive . . better send money and she will buy parfume in egypt .
check with DHL or UPS or you can buy online and diliver to her address
noha , how about sending this expensive gift through some of your known people ?? Do you know someone here in DOHA who can take parcel alongwith him/herself while they go EGYPT ??
no sonia iam new here in doha and i donot know anyone going to egypt yet : -LRB-
I dont think it is a single step process . Your new apartment will have a meter and a number given by Kahrmaa . you will need to have that no when u go to Kahrmaa and also the receipt which was given to you when you paid the adv for the current house . You will ofcourse have to fill out the transfer form and they will make the transfer . But you need to let them know when you are shifting so that they can give you the connection before you shift . I guess thats about it . its all i did when i shifted but that was in 2006 . i doubt if much has changed but here you never know . also have copies of your rp , passport and id and a fotograph just in case and a copy of your new lease agreement .
find kahrama office service depending on you area . . you need to cancel the first contract and the initiate new one . . not two birds in one shot . . cancellation procedures : 1 - take photo of the meter reading of electrisity and water both . . 2-fill up the form of cancellation 3 - copies of your identity cards 4-copy of your tenancy contract 5-copy of gurantee slip -LRB- 2000 -RRB- QR then they will calculate your balance and issue check QNB or you have to pay in case your previous payments exceeds the limit of 2000 QR advanced , next step initiate new account ... same procedure when you applied first time ... goodluck :-RRB- -RRB-
Wish you ALL the luck !!! You will need patience more honestly ... and Prayers ! ... : -RRB-
I am not sure of moving within two apts . but disconnecting and getting my refund took me not more than an hour ... as was advised went early in the morning to kharama office ... the technician came along as I was the first customer , took the reading , went back to there office , he uploaded the details and gave me a print which I carried to one of the officers for his signature and then to the cash counter , got my money ... everything happened as smoothly as it can be .
Tinker ... lol ... things generally are easy , its just your approach to things ... :-RRB- Still smile everytime I call Qtel no. 111 and am through in first dial ... touchwood ... : -RRB-
fubar ... you may be right there as my -LRB- good -RRB- experience I stated also is with their office near Jaidah flyover ...
Alright ! The only thing that worries me is I can not find the receipt for the deposit . Someone told me this is not compulsory , is that true ?
Mike - if you dont have the receipt how can you claim the advance that you have paid ? What is the proof ? It is needed .
tinker , I will have to fight that battle because if I am not wrong , my account clearly states that I currently have a QR2000 credit , how would they give me such credit without having paid the deposit ?
wish you luck Mike cuz knowing how people in govt depts here work you have a long battle ahead of ya ! No two persons at the same counter will give you the same reply ! Try it ! . . :-RRB- BTW do you have that paper they give you once you get your connection ? They give some proof of your connection with your name and details etc. . I think you can use that too ... What you say is logically correct Mike but here ... ahhh well - wish you luck ! And keep us posted ! ... :-RRB- -RRB-
I am not saying that you are wrong BUT I am hoping you are not right ;--RRB-
and i am hoping you get it all done without much hassle ! ... :-RRB- -RRB-
Mike , of all the things I 've ever had to do in Doha , closing and then re-opening my electricity was possibly the single most frustrating encounter with a government agency . Take a few days off work , it 's not going to be a duck in , duck out task you can do in your lunch break !
Fubar - with that statement you just scared the living daylights outta Mike ... :P
Ok everything was handled in 30 minutes . Went to the Musheireb branch at 6:45 am , a gentleman took all my paperwork including pictures of the old apartment 's readings , so no need to call for a technician ! They made an estimation for the final settlement , got reimbursed with the difference and then had to reopen a new account and paid a new deposit of 2100 QR . It was very easy , all thanks to Mr. Hamad from the main counter .
Dear , First decide very well what name you shall give ? After birth take father and mother passprot copy and marriage certificate . if born in hamad hospital it is quiet easy . If not -LRB- doha / al ahalia clinic then get birth notification from the hospital -RRB- and go to the birth registration office -LRB- next to lulu center , opp hamad clinic -RRB- and produce the letter in ground floor reception along with marriage certificate , parents passport and RP copy . By the time you can also get child vacination card . After that they will ask you to go to third floor . The will ask father and mother RP and qualification certificate . give it in 3rd floor and pay in ground floor . according to number of copies you will pay . after a week you can collect it.Later take it to embassy and get BIRTH CERTIFICATE from them and apply for passport . After getting passport you can also apply and get RP .
Dear Sir , First tell me ? what is your nationality , Call me I will help you , Call 6550792 I will prepare all necessary documentation for your baby pp and visa also Need Services Please call .
READ THIS http://www.qatarliving.com/node/270116
when they discharge your wife , they give u a list of docoments which are necesary for birth certificate , so apply for B.C asap , after receiving birth certificate go to your embassy for passport , when u get child 's P.P then just pay fee and enroll or registered him/her name for visa , try to do all these steps during 90 days , after 90 days they 'll fine you for late registration
The hospital will advise you for birth certificate , take 2-4 additional copies of birth certificate , it will be available for additional payment of QR . 20 / - for each . Approach your embassy for making passport for your expected baby . Apply for Residence permit Original passport one photograph of your baby Original Birth Certificate copy of blood group certificate Father & Mother RP copy . Pls . make sure you have to apply within two months , after birth , for the residence permit , otherwise there will be a fine of QR . 10 / - per day of delay .
i advice u to contact your embassy what are the procedures , but anyway in our office once they give birth they have to come to our office to register the new birth , after registration of birth they have to apply a new passport for thier child in order to obtain an RP in doha . Have a good day !

with the grace of Allah Almighty Qatar is a Muslim Country . Therefore you need to respect the Islamic Values .
Very good idea to get into trouble .
why in the world would you wan na share an hotel room with some one who is not marry to you ??
Unfortunatly My wife forgot it Back in the U.K , We are both here now spending extra money on 2 rooms . im looking for a way to spend time with my wife without flying all the way back just for a peice of paper
Just book it in one of your names , and then later have the other person jump on the elevator and join you upstairs . Be discreet , take precautions , but it can be done . If you 're caught/confronted , claim you 're married and that you just do n't have the paperwork on hand to prove it . Be outraged and indignant ... especially if you 're both western , this usually works . They really only care if one of you is Asian/Arab , or if as a couple you 're being really overt and in your face about things , lots of PDA 's etc. . Loads of guys here -LRB- locals and expats -RRB- book hotel rooms and manage to use them with a prostitute or with their regular girlfriend ... Good luck !
Have someone back home scan your Marriage Certificate and e-mail it to you . Do a good job in color and it likely wo n't be questioned . Just print it off and only show it if specirically asked to ...
Land cruiser or prado
the one i have
Prado V6 , the other one sucks .
Xterra Offroad !!!
Will you use it for dune bashing ? or just for city road like those `` never been offroad '' 4wd users :-RRB- For dune bashing : Land Cruiser , Patrol , Pajero , Pathfinder , Cherokee Classic , etc. .
If you budget is 60,000-70 ,000 then better go for Pajero , as you can get a good condition Pajero 2007-2008 model . But if you are planning for sand dunes , then Pajero is not an ideal car . You have to look for Land Cruiser or Patrol .
4Wheel drive for what purpose ? If you want to use for daily commuting , all 4WD are goood . All depends on your budget . For serious off-roading , go for Jeep Wrangler . If you are looking for just size and comfort , better you should look for after sale support , ease of spare availability , easy to maintain and easy to sell . In this catagory only Toyota and Nissan would be best choice .

... KHATTAK , ` bashoosha ' is said to a person with an accommodating smiling face , who barely shows unpleasant expression even in troubled times .
Thanks happy ... I believe ghazalz had rightly used the word ` bashoosha ' for you ... :-RRB- I think the Urdu word `` bashash '' is being derived from ` bashoosha ' ... which means ` fresh ' .
thanks for defining me happy ... i never knew i am bashoosha . . and defining oneself is most difficult job in unverse

Hey hey Khattak , I just checked with my Pakistani friend who shares accommodation with me , he told me it means something totally different in pushto : - P
WK ... that would be ` legs ' with a slightly different pronunciation . : D
if happy thinks am gentleman ... i beleive it and that makes me a head moron
... whyteknight , thanks a lot , I just read it . KHATTAK , One Arabic word , would have different meanings , by a subtle change of the vowels , the same reason why vowing in Quran is mandated .
LOLzzz ... LT , well in that case ... its `` Khpay '' .
Khappay also means naughty .
Exactly happy ... thats what our teacher explained to us by mentioning ` rajul ' and ` rijil ' . -LRB- I hope I pronounced it well -RRB- : D
looks are deceiving . . and in case of morons they look extremely serious as a first impression
Wow ... it 's motivating !
Thank you so much HappyHappy ! I heard this song so many times and I liked the song very much . So I was eager to kno the meaning .
edifis . . Now that i know its meaning , i thought that you were singing that song for Happy2 .
Why not , `` A journey to the past through the eyes of the Queen Nefertiti '' That is wishful thinking !
Happy I will give you PDC ?
... shapil , no , I have nothing to do with teaching or uttering swear words . Not in my dictionary . Sorry ... But yes ! These curse words are the first an expat/tourist would catch , and they stick ! ... whyteknight , we have already started classes here , have n't we ?

Khattak it 's your duty to tell my best friend that I apologised , I need him back for this gathering . Do n't let me down : -RRB-
i am already disappointed with u khattak ... meeting u will be more disappionting than not meeting u. . . so its all about disappointment when it comes to u

... Got it KHATTAK , but you do realize this is not the standard Arabic ? I really dont know of the origin . whyteknight , I think khappee has something to do with the Pakistani political system , not sure though .
... Thanks KHATTAK , and very best of luck with your Arabic endeavor .
wives being on seperate sponsors , is when the wife was on family sponsorship , ie , her fathers - when the kids were born immigration asked for the wife 's sponsorship to be transfered to the husband .
Yes , why not ? Sponsors does n't matter as long as you are married . You should be having proper marriage certificate just in case . But most of the married couples here if working are with different sponsors . Not a problem at all .
And you can live together .
make sure that you marriage certificate verified with your embassy ... then noooo probz ... u can stay together . .
I appreciate everyone . I thought as well earlier but I wanted to be sure of it . I know I will definitely get a rightful answer to my question on QL . You guys are great !

go to the nearest police station in your area and ask the officer .
I would n't have thought so , but it ca n't hurt to try .
Wo n't Work ... Either Original Passport or Valid Qatari ID ...
Not any longer , as some people started taking advantage of the photocopy idea and changing their year of birth . Qatari ID -LRB- or some ID - wherever you are from -RRB- or your passport is now required .
Most of Car Wash places have it , check with them .
Most Car wash does n't have tire air pressure , i asked lot of petrol stations and they told me that the only station that has tire air pressure is like 8 kms -LRB- hamour -RRB- , even that station they did n't have air pressure for tires , instead there was tires repair shop next to them . There 's plenty of tires repair shop around Doha . If you tell me about ur exact location , i can make use of my GPS : -RRB-
Tire Shops got it , Suggest you buy yourself an instrument to measure the pressure yourself -LRB- cost from 35 Rials -RRB- and if you buy yourself a compressor you are self sufficient .
Woqood patrol & service station , you can check the tyre pressure , all the simple services
open the driver seat door and near to the seat at the bottom there is the tyre pressue values . you can see that and put air . this is available in all the cars . , , see ya
No doubt about it . Do it .
Thanks everybody !! . . Be there soon WITH my skype !
I have a connection at home , I 've put a wireless router . . and I use skype nearly everyday . .
A VISIT VISA is valid ONLY for 6 months . It is rare to get an extention more than that . And as to a RP your son is over 18 and you will NOT be able to sponsor him . The only way to keep him here on an RP is for him to be sponsored by a company .
. If your son is a student you can get the renewal by submitting student certificates from the university concerned . Try it if applicable .
He needs to find a job n get visa from the company and will get work permit
I heard that effective date is 1/4 , but the law still has n't been signed .
Thank you very much `` BLEU '' for your valuable info . Keep me updated to this comment when you get more info on this subject .
It should all be clear in 2 weeks .

Naming after a Prophet 2 . The Prophet said : Call yourselves by the names of the Prophets . The names dearest to Allah are <b> Abdullah and AbdurRahman , the truest are Harith and Hammam , </b> and the worst are Harb and Murrah . `` All praise is due to Allah -LRB- SWT -RRB- we beseech Him for help and we ask for His protection and we seek refuge in Him from the mischief 's of our souls ; whomsoever Allah -LRB- SWT -RRB- guides there is none who can lead him astray and whomsoever Allah -LRB- SWT -RRB- finds in error there is none to guide him ; and I bear witness that there is no God but Allah -LRB- SWT -RRB- and that Muhammad -LRB- saws -RRB- is His servant and His Messenger ''

Yes , you will need special permission from the Embassy for her to re-enter . I tried to do the same one time at the embassy in Doha , and they told me to come back after 1pm . When I came back after 1pm , they then told me they were closed , and refused to see me . In the end I cancelled my trip and have never been back to India .

3 months is enough , last year i visited Oman , no much of hassles and process is also very quick , all the best ,
3 months minimum and it is very easy there .
Thanks a ton guys for the Quick response . . i got 3 different Answers from 3 Different Officials in Qatar.I jus happend to check with the Oman Airport website . . It says 6 months Rp Validity ??? but the embassy says u jus need passport Validity more than 6
Passport validy of 6 months and GCC RP validity of 3 months is what you need .
Hi I went by Qatar Airways and Oman Air to Oman several times . It is 3 month validity for visa . You have to pay 3 omani reyal for visa .
Hi , I believe all Schengen visa applications are dealt with via the German Embassy in Doha . Probably best to check their website for further details . Best of luck .
I think Swedish Embassy is in Kuwait . There was a thread in QL earlier in 2010 regareding this issue -LRB- do a search -RRB- . You may call and ask them or you may check with the Embassies of other Schengen countries -LRB- France , Germany etc. -RRB- for further details . I dont think you need insurance documents for applying the visa .
you can apply for schengen visa through any other schengen countries -LRB- France , Germany - pretty much all of the EU countries -RRB- although apparently they all have different rules , so look around . I assume you will be catching a flight through another EU country anyways , so just have to have a stop over probably . good luck !
No need of having Swiss Embassy to get Shengen Visa . You can use services of German Embassy to get this . It is in Bin Omran ... Opposit side of Ahli Hospital , , the road near Salaam HO . -LRB- i dont know they changed location -RRB-
8 months is not tooo much i think ... but anyway u can consult a doctor , i suggest Dr.Khudsiya Beegum , alwaab street -LRB- khalifa stadium -RRB- You need to go there to get register for first time , the clinc timings are 8:00 AM to 12:00 noon then from 16:00 to 20:00 from Surterday to Thursday . contact : 44475969
If you are taking alcohol or tobacco , cut down . Get yourself free from any stress . Winter is coming . Do not loose hope .
I advice to go to Hamad hospital ... As Khudsia Begum is not the best doctor . Just this site makes good advertising for her ... Being in emergency situation I did not get any help from her ... Just was re-directed to Hamad ... But their money they take accurately . So I do not trust any private hospitals . For the money they charge at Dr. Khudsia 's clinics they could at least provide the tissues and soap in ladys ' WC ...
you need basic investigations that can be done with any gynaec dr.even dr.beegum is ok for that .
Can anyone tell me , what is needed to marry in a mosque in Qatar ? It takes some document or medical examination
what nationality are u ??
are you male or female ?
Muslim Marriages are performed at the Sharia Court , which is located on Al Rayyan Road near Mannai Ra in the Musheirib area . You must provide two witnesses for the marriage . Please note that the Sharia Court will only marry two muslims . Even though marriages between Muslim men and Christian women are performed by Sharia courts in other Muslim countries , they are not performed in Qatar . But they need the papers from health centers -LRB- pre marital examination -RRB- i took mine in al rayyan health center . have an appointment before going there . you will get the result after 2 weeks . and since i dont ahve nokah here and my father passed away they asked for a certificate that he passed away and a certificate that i didnt get marry before .
I just found this from their site Najma Branch Address P.O.Box : 23449 , Doha , Qatar Branch Code : 218 Fax : -LRB- +974 -RRB- 44270595 Timings : Sunday to Thursday -LRB- 7:30 am - 1:00 pm -RRB- Regards !!

worry about walet ?? then go straight away to IS300 , or even IS350 , and think about ES350 , great preformance , reasonable luxury , and good price at resale , BMW5 is a bit pricy , Benz E r going to be changed next year , C class is small ,
Lexus any day . .
Are u asking about cost in AL AIN -LSB- Abu Dhabi -RSB- then why u have posted in QATAR . . Qatar is a country , nothing to do with UAE . Plz , review ur question
Dear friend , I have lived in UAE for more than 12 years and an year back only shifted to Doha , Qatar . Of all the 7 emirates , in terms of house rents , Abu Dhabi is considered to be the most expensive but Al Ain being less populated , the price you pay for a two bedroom ordinary flat , you may get a 3 bedroom villa in Al Ain.That too , due to recession effect , the prices are expected to be slashed . The schools are also easy to get admission due to the same reason of less populated area . A quite place but you will get easy access to all basic amenities , like shops , taxi stands . Even the taxi fare is comparatively less than other Emirates esp Dubai . Hope this information was useful to you . If I come across some more significant info , will definitely post it or will PM you . Regards ,
i think qatar is the best 4 u. we have best schools in here.and leave UAE
no need
Good place in Doha Air port Runway
People keep boats on trailers like they keep cars in the roads . There are plenty of boats everywhere in Doha on trailers .
SERCH IN INDUSTRIAL AREA FOR A STORE . .
20 ft boat is not a problem . find a open place near where ever you stay , and park it there . Hotel Marinas ' are expensive and no point buy a parking for a 20 footer .
Dont worry its not required

Women can and do go to the gym here . Try a search in the box , top right , for martial arts . It 's been discussed lots lately .
Herein a link to start http://www.qatarliving.com/group/self-defence Regards !!! On the other hand I have to agree with baldrick2dogs : do a search , you will get lots of stuff by just searching , it 's a small effort with huge rewards !!!
Females are allowed !
Hi gail , the topic of your question is if there is martial arts in qatar . The answer is yes . There is taekwondo , karate , aikido , etc. . for fitness purposes specifically ? i have not heard . and females are allowed to go to the gym . The gyms in this country is gender specific . Ladies gym , and men 's gym .
it 's by the Muslim way of course , where can i get further information and where is the register office in Doha ?
First let me congrat you on this happy occassion . It is located in the Primary Court Building , Ground Floor . The Building is located near Hamad Medical Center , In front of the Blue Saloon in Al Sadd area . Last time i was there , the working time was after Al Eshaa Paryer , you can go and check any time . Hope this can help you and congratulation in advance .

Medical Commision isw the only place
Better your wife contact the below : Qatar Embassy , Philippines 2nd Floor , One World Building No. 10 Upper McKinley Road , McKInley Hill , Fort Bonifacio Taguig City Philippines Phone : +63 -2 -856 -6666 +63 -2 -856 -1222 +63 -2 -856 -1444 Fax : +63 -2 -856 -1999 +63 -2 -856 -2444 Email : qemanila_consular@yahoo.com qe_amboffice@yahoo.com Or Contact any LBC/DHL courier , one of the two are the official courier which are the only one authorize to process your wife 's visa clearance & sticker for exit from the airport . Also , they know what are the requirements to be submitted . One thing for sure , you need to send her the approve copy of the family visa . Previously , this site was giving the details of the accredited clinics , now it 's not working . http://qatarembassy.com.ph/index.php/consular-service/accredited-medical-clinis
BTW , give your area , there are 24 clinics in Manila area and 2 in Cebu , 1 in Davao & 1 in Bacolod . The list are from last year -LRB- 2011 -RRB- . Few might be not accredited any longer .
i think there is no need for her to take medical in philippines as when she arrives here she will undergo medical procedure at medical commission to process the permanent resident visa

I would buy a new power adapter first . Cheapest option . If that does n't fix the problem then ditch the phobne and buyt a new one .
Hi Eatch , It may only affect the power supply of the unit . If you have other power supply that can test your unit do it otherwise look for a repairman . Have a good weekend .
I appreciate your support , the problem is , I 've never seen such adaptor before . The outlet socket -LRB- head -RRB- looks like the telephone 's one . I think it is a new tech that will not be valid in the local market .
Eatch every kind of adaptor is available here , visit Barwa village .

Near najada sofitel
hi sofitel is the best place for computer spare parts
Except for the case and power supply -LRB- expensive shipping due to weight -RRB- , it might be cheaper to source other parts through Amazon w / Aramex shop n ship .
Oops sorry , a fault . Delete the 2 post above please . Thx :-RRB- I have found a store called ` tornado ' store and it 's on the sofitel area man . It 's a good store with Processors , RAM , Motherboard , Graphic Cards , Casing , etc and even up to Corsair H80 . But the problem is that they do n't have Good Quality Power Supply -LRB- Antec , Seasonic , Corsair , etc -RRB- They only have Gigabyte and Cooler Master :-LRB- . I 'm looking forward if there is a better store and It would be really good if you show me what is it 's name and where it is exactly . But if no then I should order the parts that are not available there :-LRB- .
Yea that Gigabyte store is one of the best around here -LRB- the one just opposite sofitel / mercure grand -RRB- . You 'll not find an antec , seasonic in here . I waited for 6 months for a scheduled business trip to dubai to pick up an antec earthwatts . Picked it up on Bur Dubai . There is a place similar to sofitel / mercure grand ... just more bigger and better -LRB- do n't remember which one , but all the taxi folks know it -RRB- . .
How abt MAHARAJA hotel 's BIRYANI ??? I find it quite tasty ... Try it once ...
aalishan restaraunt , in al muntazah after party mania . the biryani is way better than shezan . http://foodguideqatar.weebly.com/
Go to Grand Hamad Street -LRB- Bank Street -RRB- and go into Century Restaurant . They have the best Dhum Biriyani especially on the Fridays their Biriyani is the best food . Very nominal Price of Qrs . 10.00 . Its right behind Doha Bank and Clear visible over the parking behind Doha Bank .
<i> I would recommend the one offered by `` Shezan Restaurant '' ... I just love it : - -RRB-
:-RRB- . . obviously : Pakistani restaurant located near the masjid near mannai roundabout , only problem -LRB- since the food their is awesome stuff -RRB- you get to order after waiting in a queue -LRB- long one -RRB- . . trust me . . its worht the 15/20 min wait !!!! . oh by the way im indian for those who think too much . : -RRB-
Because cheap labour with the neccessary skill set is available there .
Not only HP , and not only Qatar
Almost all laptops now are made in China . you can ask the sales person in any shop and you 'll find the same answer . Others parts of the laptop may come from other countries but still the laptops itself is made in China . Ranking of the Laptops here in Qatar is like of the ff : 1st . Dell / Toshiba / Sony / HP 2nd Acer / Compaq / Fujitsu 3rd Lenovo / BenQ Mine is an Acer Laptop . It really works for me and it does not give me any headache . It 's cool . Its in the matter of how you take care and use your laptop . Good Luck and all the best !
HP battery back up sucks ...
All laptops are made in China . Only a limited number of Sony VAIO are made in Japan . You can get one for like QAR 8,000 or QAR 9,000 . Also , they are planning to discontinue the production in Japan . So , if you want a Japanese laptop , you need to hurry .
its cos the labour charge in china is cheaper ... the parts are sourced from other countires though , its just assembled in china ... i personally use an acer ferrari which is made in china and no probs so far

Not fit for drinking . Use bottled water instead .
I drink it .
Comparing to bottled water tap water is good in quality analysis . what really make difference is cleanliness . If your storage is clean and using filter , then tap water is the better .
I 'm drinking tap water for years ...
There were many articles before on QL whether the BOTTLED WATERS are fit for drinking or not . . All bottled waters r not safe for drinking coz of high sodium content which is harmful for human health in long run ... People are installing RO -LRB- REVERSE OSMOSIS -RRB- at their home that filters TAP WATER which one can drink straight away ... please go through the links below for detail . http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1206080 http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1206095 http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1227920 http://www.qatarliving.com/search?cx=008937172676595728955:066rihafv68&cof=FORID:11&Q=bottled+water&sa=Search#1564

how much is the entrance fee and what kind of food there are serving ?
sorry i am not sure , we stayed in a villa over night so I do not know the entrance prices . Best bet is to give them a call
Oh , thank you You 're very smart !
Honestly if you can do the applications alone the lawyers arent any faster . You just have to be persistant . Lawyers will tell you that they have a special arrangmenet but it is baloney . `` Diplomacy is the art of saying ` Nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers ''
Thanks for the info amoud , , is it really so ? howabout going thru the consultancy office ?
does n't matter what you are going through ! Canada Immigration officer does n't care about it . He/She is strictly following the procedure , rules and instructions . and by the way this is the first thing you guys have to learn about canada . You have to be loyal and law obedient and rules respectful . No fooling around , no playing games , no middle-eastern tricks and focus-pocuses ! If you have gained enough points on six factors , you become eligible to APPLY for the Immigration . It doesnt make you a Permanent Resident automatically though . <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed . Antoine de Saint-Exupry </b> </i> <imgÂ src=http://cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif>
you really dont need a lawyer to apply for immigration to canada though its ok to hire one ... just look for people who have gone through it to guide you in filling up the forms and of course you have to do your own reading ... i found out late so better get all the info in their website : http://www.cic.gc.ca
greentea , it 's not necessary , but some assistance of the experienced individual might be very helpful ! Sometimes everything goes smooth and easy . Sometimes there are hidden problems on the way . Filling up the application is a very first and easiest step of the process . On the other hand , if the information provided in the application form is correct and TRUTHFUL , and based on this information the person is eligible for the immigration process , it shouldnt be any issue with that . . but sometimes some unpredictable things happen . . here is the example . 5 points are given for the relatives in Canada . Lets say the applicant has a sister who possesses a Resident status in Canada . While filling in the application , the applicant adds 5 points to his score , and it helps him to get 67 points . But . . once the Immigration Office asks for the documents to prove the claims in the initial application . And then it turns out , that a sister doesnt live in Canada at all . She lives , lets say in her home country , Lebanon . And guess what , these 5 points for sister in Canada are taken out of the applicant 's score . And then the applicant is left with only 62 points , which are not enough for the status of Immigrant . The case is refused and closed . This is only an example . There are a lot of different things and different issues . But again , if applicant is honest , and everything is clear and not doubtful , it shouldnt be any problems . . I met one guy who wants to immigrate . . when I asked him what kind of education does he have , he said : high school . I said : there is no any chance for you . He said : oh , its not a problem . . I can get any Diploma , Degree , Certificates you want . I said : I dont WANT you to get anything . I dont want you to immigrate to Canada with this kind of moral norms , at the first place . <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed . Antoine de Saint-Exupry </b> </i> <imgÂ src=http://cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif>
Honesty on the application is a different matter . Thats down to morals and common sense . A lawyer or consultant is not all that helpful . If you have questions about the application you can usually find it on the site . If any questions arise the embassy will call you . Also dont believe them when they say their clients never get interviews , these are also random and if you are on the up and up no worries . A lawyer/consultant will cost you between 2000-3000 $ . Totally not worth it , Just make sure you have all the required docs etc together and understand the process from the site before applying . `` Diplomacy is the art of saying ` Nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers ''
my lawyer gave me the forms to fill up then send him back the forms and the documents to go with it . later he met me again to review the filled up forms -LRB- in adobe format this time -RRB- then if entries are correct and no changes made , i signed it then send it back to him again . after a few months , he send me the file number . that 's it for 2 years i did not hear from him again . i just have to check the website for the status of my application using my file number . the next time i heard from him , he advised me to download again the same forms from the website and fill it up , sign , follow the list of exhibits to be submitted that are not yet submitted earlier then submit direct to high commission of canada within 90 days from the date the letter was issued . good thing i made a photocopy of my original documents to avoid discrepancies . so basically , in the end you still have to send updated forms direct to the high commission
I am an expert in a lot of issues . . just lazy to express my knowledge , opinions and thoughts . . LOL . . You have to live in Canada 3 years out of 4 to be eligible to apply for the Citizenship . It means if you dont leave Canada for 3 years at all , then you can apply . . in case you go back and forth , you have to collect 1095 days during 4 years . You wont be able to apply for the citizenship , until you collect 1095 days during last 4 years . . <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed .

I agree 100 % Qatarisun , the forms in all are a bit complicated but I must say the lawyer does nothing . I can mail a letter for crying out loud `` Diplomacy is the art of saying ` Nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers ''
of course you have to send the UPDATED forms again ! 2 years have passed !! a lot of changes in your life may occur in 2 years ! You might get married , and your educated husband will get extra points , which will make your case stronger . Or other way around , you get divorced and your husband is no longer in your application . . and his points disappear along with him . . :-RRB- . . Or you had a baby , and you want to include her/him into your application ... life is going on . . that 's why it 's normal to ask for the current information which is up to date . . . . but for you it 's good news . it means you are getting closer . . :-RRB- <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed .

You can apply through follwing site ... http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/index.asp
what i mean is when i filled in the forms myself i realized , why did i ever hire a lawyer ? filling up the forms and completing the exhibits is not as hard as i thought . . but then it 's done ... what to do yanni ? just wish for the best : D
Thanks Qatarisun/Amoud . . here my second question , what if someone -LRB- landed immigrant -RRB- stayed in Canada for one month than came back and already has spend more than 3 years outside Canada , can he/she go back or he/she has to apply again for immigration ? You would be helping a lot , thanks <p> &#160; </p> <p> Onewho has n't taken risks has n't lived </p>
It depends tipu . Are you married to a Canadian Citizen ? If you are married to a Canadian and are accompanying them abroad you are fine . If not I would seriously check your Residence status as you can not fulfil your 2 year obligation and have stayed out of the country for more than 6 months . This needs to be answered by an immigration official . `` Diplomacy is the art of saying ` Nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers ''
but there is no belgium embassy in Qatar so where i need to try ?
Immigration representatives are people who offer immigration advice or assistance to visa applicants , usually for a fee . You do not need to hire an immigration representative . It is up to you . The Government of Canada treats everyone equally , whether they use the services of a representative or not . If you choose to hire a representative , your application will not be given special attention by the immigration officer . Your representative also can not guarantee that your application will be approved . All the forms and information that you need to apply for a visa are available for free on this website . If you follow the instructions in the application guide , you can complete the application forms and submit them on your own . http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/representative/index.asp In this modern world , internet is the greate qualizer .

I would put it in my wifes hand bag and go to Paris
Keep half , invest half of that -LRB- ie . quarter -RRB- and give the other half away - to genuinely needy people - not the cheaters who take advantage of people 's goodwill .
i would give about 10 % to sadaka -LRB- charity -RRB- and invest a big portion of the rest , and the other small portion i would perhaps travel the world : -RRB-
CONVERT IT INTO INDIAN ONE RUPEE NOTES AND EMPLOY SOMEONE TO COUNT THEM CONTINUOSLY AT THE RATE OF ONE NOTE PER SECOND FOR 5 MONTHS .
I would invest it in driving lessons for most of the drivers here on the roads ! I have never seen such bad and dangerous driving in my whole life .
make a model town for the slums in my country and educate the poor .
I will never spend that , I will encash it to 50 riyals lot , and just keep it on my table and look at it for one year and try to retrieve as much as pleasure and enjoy the presnece of that package infront of me always . I know the basic principle already that money is what money does. , but that is only for the money I earned . Here I meant by this exercise the retention of happiness and pleasure throughout the life from what I unexpectedly got from a source in which I have no effort at all . One thing in here to remind it. , when there is no happiness radiating to me from that for any reason , then I have somthing to do it . that is still suspence . lol. , let me first see when this happents to me .
Give the half to my hubby , and invest the other half at the Bank of Switzerland . So ambitious ! : -RRB-
hms ... I have started green tea since last few days ... and still experimenting with it ... But as far as I know the benefits you will not see soon . Green tea has herbs which can fight against fat .
I 've been drinking green tea for two years now , I 'm still alive and no changes to my body . Still have astma and high blood pressure .
hms it will be more helpful if you will make gree tea at home by your own , you know standing in kitchen without AC really helps ... he he he
i am drinking green tea for the last 2 years ... .
tea tea
hms , do u know i 'd dedicated one full thread on GREEN TEA long back . . take a look http://www.qatarliving.com/node/912977
Personally i have never liked GREEN TEA 's taste . . For me , an authentic INDIAN KADAK -LRB- STRONG -RRB- TEA is better than ne other . . lol

I was used the site <aÂ href=http://www.mobile-unlocker.com/> Mobile Unlocking </a> For the Mobile Unlocking Codes Purchasing .
What software is it ? If it 's Norton , you can use the Norton Removal Tool . You can download it on the net , just Google it .
try TUNE UP UTILITIES , its a good system cleaner , hard disc and registry , also removes junk files .
the messed up part is that it doesnt have the uninstall file . Also how do i use regedit . . can u explain it a lil further . thanks
Format your C drive at least three times , and then re-install the programs you want . It 's the usual `` clean '' uninstall . Anything you delete or unistall will still be there . There will be a reference in the registry that you ` uninstalled ' a program .
I use ccleaner -LRB- it removes programs even when the unistall option is missing -RRB- , and does some other stuff . best part ? it 's free . Best , JF

yes you will have to pay your monthly utility -LRB- w/e -RRB- bills as they give you electricity allowance ... it 's in your contract . . you signed it and there 's nothing you can do about it but to abide with it ...
As you have signed the house agreement without w/e and as your company has agreed for electricity allowance , better discuss and clear the matter with your company . that 's the only solution .
It depends . As per your agreement you will be the one paying the utility bills as you are getting an allowance . There are many Companies in Qatar who are paying the utility bills but they are not giving such allowances to their employees .
water and electric bills are provided in your accomodation . your company will be the resposible to pay it . company can not rent an accomodation if the water and electricity bill is not included in their contract with the owner of the house . if water and electric bill are not included in your accomodation , that means you are not provided with accomodation . that means you are leaving out which is the company is giving you housing allowance and it 's up to you look for an accomodation whether sharing or independent ...

Dear Friend , Do n't use QL for these kind of clarifications ... You will get different answers ... Some will say 40 +7 , another will say 30 +7 so on ... Always try to find these kind of informations from the reliable sources ... why dont u call Qatar airways or may be the travel agent where u have purchased ticket . .
Qatar Airways will allow you to take 40kg checked in and 7kg cabin baggage to Kerala . I am regularly travelling by Qatar Airways . It would have written 30kg on your e-ticket .
40kg +7 kg hand carrier + laptop if u hv . .
Yes , you can take 40kg luggage + 7kg hand baggage with Qatar Airways on my experience till two weeks back .
Yes . That is one of he principle duties of all embassies .
Great.Will do . Thanks chaps .
Yes if you have an embassy here

If you do n't have one , why do n't you get an International Driving License at any travel agency ?
http://www.alloexpat.com/abu_dhabi_expat_forum/abu-dhabi-driving-driving-in-abu-dhabi-uae-guide-t1656.html The above website states `` yes , you can '' . I would suggest you call a car rental agency in Dubai and confirm . A couple of telephone numbers that you may use to check : Dollar rent a car : Tel. : 00971 4 3365065 , Thrifty : Tel : 00971 4 3479001 . Happy travelling .
Im sure of my answer that `` you can '' as one of our a client is visiting our office in Dubai from time to time and he 's always renting a car using his Qatar Driving license . He usually rents with Dollar Rent-a-Car from the DXB airport arrival .
Yes you can . . I have tried it several times .
I know many American ladies here and a lot of them are homeschooling . If you are interested I can get you one of their phone numbers -LRB- they are not all on QL -RRB- and you can ask her what programs they use .
That would be greatly appreciated . Please send me any contact to my email or I can send you mine to your email so they can call . Either way if fine with me and than you very much for your help .
Why homeschool ? Why not embrace the country you are living in ? When I live in UK I sent my kids to UK schools . It 's a great chance to share culture .
to go to a Qatari school when you do n't speak a word of Arabic . It 's my understanding that the public Qatari schools only accept Qatari children . check out : http://dohahomeeducators.wordpress.com/ alternatively check out : WWW.k12.com /
Learning about culture is important , but having good education is more important . My boys do n't speak any Arabic . They have to be placed in a school with english program and these schools are few and most of the time they have long waiting lists .

Never give your business plan/idea to any stranger in QL .

Negative . from personal to comercial no.Law says person should completed 6 years in personal sposorship . but even today I have many cases applications rejected . I my self failed to get nice jobs in companies due to same reason . But implementation and interpetition of law also matters .
u can . . but expensive !!
Most of the shopping malls have at least one baby shop , if not more .
there is a babyshop in city centre and centre point . they will have a sale in december if you can wait , and they usually have sales 3 times a year . mother care is having a sale now too - not sure when you checked . there is also a carter 's in Hyatt . normally expensive but they are having a sale now . ___________________________________________ `` Even a stopped clock gives the right time twice a day .

cheap clothes fro kids and adults -- there is a Sana by the Sana Roundabout , also 2nd floor of City Center . :-RRB- *** lucky * wifey ***
I have 2 little ones ... Try Max and Sana in City Center ... Also Babyshop , I dont like the clothing styles they have for older kids , but you 'll find good things for babies . Also , most places have major sales several times a year . So you can wait and get stuff at Mothercare and Pumpkin Patch for 50 % off ...
You can get good cotton dresses for baby girls at Sana -LRB- City Centre -RRB- for affordable pricess and try baby shop . nq
For small to medium scale type of business . . MYOB is good coz you can customize everything . . from forms to type of business you had ... QUICKBOOKS is also good ... best for those with much receivables and for those who are sending their bills via email ... Peachtree . . combination of the two . .
MYOB is really well supported . However , locally people are using all sorts of unknowns like peach tree etc. . Stick with the commercial grade `` OFF-THE-SHELF '' MYOB * : ` Proud Supporter Of Canterbury Bulldogs ; '' * Doggies Rulz
as per experience , QUICKBOOKS and PEACH TREE are most common . they are really easy to use and understand . they can be customized as per need of your business . check what suits your needs and thaqt will be the best though . kudos !
For the medium and small scale business tally is goodenough than all other softwares of its range . When compared to peachtree it has a lot of thigs which is essential for an accounting department . I AM AUTHORISED TALLY CONSULTANT AND RESELLER . PLS CONTACT ME FOR FURTHER DETAILS . SAMEER MOB : 5812978 Email : sameerplk@gmail.com
from my humble experience peach tree is complicated and not that user friendly and i think u should have extensive course for it , , but to tell the truth it has alot of potential as well
ofcourse ... QL

i 'll be reaching Doha by end of june , hope its not before that ... last time the sandstorms were a pain ... let 's see this year ...
Info can be got from Doha Players - they did email me to say Nov , but I ca n't find their email with dates on ! <i> This is picture is obviously NOT me , I do n't smoke . . <i>
Thanks , I 'll bump this post up later . I went in my first few weeks of being here in Qatar . This tim ei will be better prepared and take some time off the next day so I can be around after dark =-RRB- Mitch
The last I heard it has been moved to November . I think after summer would be a little too hot . November should be cool . I hope they give enough advance notification for Auditions this year . With the Quad bikes issue being reduced last year -LRB- compared to 2007 -RRB- underage youth playing loud Rap music and getting drunk was a rather disturbing site . Too obvious to miss the fact they were not there for the music . This creates an unwanted nuisance for Dune stockers with families and loyal dune stockers who have been present since it came into existance . As I musician , it put me down a bit . I missed civil defense I.e. Police patrolling the area like the year before . That will automatically reduce `` Underage '' activities taking place . . -LRB- or atleast in the open public -RRB- I am also aware the there has always been an issue with volunteers backing out at the end moment . I think getting a group of loyal mature musicians and music fans -LRB- period -RRB- from QL to help support Dunestock would be a great idea . I think at events like these , its almost common sense that they need all the support they can get . . oh well ... just a thought ... Rock n ' Roll . .
`` G '' Thank you so much ! Last time was amazing , remember when I asked `` is this why they call it the singing dunes '' ? You just shut the top of ma beer ! lol There goes the sound ...
heard that it is sth like 6th of Nov. . .
I have it in my PC , i am just about to start watching it . Yes i also think it would be worth watching as IMDB has given a rating of 8.9 ! -LRB- out of 10 ! -RRB- And it is currently the 78th Best Movie ever made ... So yea , i 'll try to post later of how it goes .
A movie from South Africa . An extraterrestrial race forced to live in slum-like conditions on Earth suddenly find a kindred spirit in a government agent that is exposed to their biotechnology . Downloaded already : D
Brute force and tyrants can stop this happenings once in a while but not always and imagine what the world will be thinking about the tyrants in Qatar who go about beating and brutalizing football lovers
The Dutch team will likely find Qatar to be a slight improvement , but they 're probably the only ones .
Qatar should be prepared 10 years from now to train its riot policemen and modernize its equipment in order to handle any bloody riot incidents between fans of competing countries of WORLD CUP 2022 .
There does not seem to have been that much trouble in Euro 2012 but the quality on the pitch has been good .
safety is a factor that needs to be maintained The russians are capable of creating another fire !!! Wid all the VODKA :D
I doubt that many Russians will travel to be honest . They are not known for travelling in numbers and Poland is about the closet tournament they are going to get -LRB- apart from when they host the 2018 WC of course -RRB- which I think we be a complete disaster !
it depends on the nationality ! i think its ok if they are Europen or Americans . but if they are arabs it will not ganna works . but better you have to check with the hotel it self .
No chance brother .
no they cant ...
No , they have to live separately
and maybe we can suggest a price . Sometimes they want `` special numbers `` that could remind them of the mobile , birthday , etc Regards !!
its depends on the serial number of the car plate '' usually '' , and sometimes if it 's 4 or 3 digit , you can ask any car trader and they can give you the price , maybe you can check the special auto newspaper .
yeah as drsam said . . ask him how much he 'd pay you -LRB- in a confident way -RRB- and then double everything even the number plate change fee : P
Dear Salah , Is this 5 % withholding tax can be refunded by non-resident company ? Do you have idea when it comes to filing and payment ? And where to file ? Thanks in advance .
withholding applies only to companies that have no entity in Qatar . -LRB- no Commercial Register -RRB- I think it 's fair as those companies do n't have expensis nor support the local economy .
Currently new law is put on Hold ! Suggest to check online at Ministry of Finance website for detail tax presentation and E&Y or KPMG Tax consultants for latest update .
you can not withold paying taxes unless you are a 100 % qatari owned company .
Dear Salah , My understanding is that withholding tax is applicable all the international transfers they do n't have a Permanent establishment here . That means if we are transferring funds to Head Office we should have withhold . Please correct me if I am wrong . Thanks
Dear Victory , I didnt know that ... ; Let me check with E&Y . They are also our Auditors . Anyway thanks a lot for the replay .
Victory kindly give me the Link of the website.please
u should understand the difference between withholding and actual taxes . As per the law which came in effect on 1/1/2010 , for those companies that are doing work in the country without being registered / do n't have CR / the owner of the contract will withhold either 5 % or 7 % -LRB- depends on the activity -RRB- of the total payment on monthly basis . This amount will be paid to the tax authority before the 15th of the following month . In my opinion , this is to encourage foreign companies to establish a base office in the country .
I too had been to Health Spring Clinic . Really needs to be appreciated . Experienced doctors & very well set .
thanks for your help stealth . i know i can count on you
where is this clinic
Send a PmM to admin
Lol does it mean I will not get my iPhone 4g
Flag the thread offensive ??
There is no direct option to do so , the worst lack ever in QatLiv .
thanx for that - i can book my flights now !
Ramadam ? Which bird is it ?
tattoo parlor . its illegal here . but you can get a temporary one .
I love Tattoos . I remember going to the one in Edinburgh last year . .
Having a tattoo in Qatar is not illegal , but giving one in a shop is .
you dont have to cover them up , but its an underground artist who will do one for you
some of my friends here have tattoos . but the decent tattoo artists are not in this country . better get one elsewhere as it will become a permanent part of you and you ca n't entrust this to just anyone simply because it 's convenient to have it done here .
but I cant tell you ... coz I do n't know either :-RRB- I just see the tattoos some of my friends got but havent met the artist .
does it really matter to U ?
for me it matters coz i already hav some tats and just wanted to know what I would have to go through if i were to come there .
DaRu , How did you see that butterfly tattoo on brits lower back you funny boy !
can you tell me from where can i get tattoos in qatar ?
Ahhh my stalker ... is back ... Amiiii do n't u have a Real job to do , and it does not mean checking when I am on QL !
I hope you will report him to the authorities . .
Hiya Smoke , yes awake , but wanting to sleep ... ca n't turn off the phone , and good thing I did n't , I just had a good phone interview for a job I applied for . But , a certain stalker seems to track me here at QL if I am awake or not , then keeps calling me ... . . Where is my paycheck for my time on QL ????? I searched for the cashier all over , and ca n't seem to find her/him ... . : s Lol
Now , smoke you do realize you created a hijack with that loaded question ... . . lol he got my number cuz I know him outside of QL ... the rest will stay a mystery ; - s And thx for the good luck , if it 's a night job then it 's day shift from USA , and they have a branch in my city . So yeaaaaaa I hope so . Now back to the tattoo thread lol I love my tat ... you would too if I was allowed to lift my shirt in Qatar ... .
offer is not bad , but the family status need atleast qar .10,000 / - pm
Dear try to convince / negotiate them for a package offer Qr10 ,000 / - , then only you can apply for family Visa . QR10K is salary limit for family residence visa . Good Luck .
I think the offer is not so good . An IT dept. head should get at least QRs - 6000 - 9000 / - And for the family status you need a minimum of 10000 / - So think & negotiate with them
Dear , , this guy not approching for the post of a Principal , how can he negotiate with this , and it seems the management could be an INDIAN .
The package is entry level only as Junior Executive . But if you think that your current profile is matching with these just go ahead . If you have good no : of years of IT exp and good skill sets never accept this as this the most lowest salary package . Regarding Family status you need atleast 10,000 QR as salary and this should be shown in your monthly bank statement too . -LRB- includes/not includes HRA -RRB-
hi ... which school is this ... ... dont mind one of my friend is working with college of north atlantic and she is getting 17500qr ... ... the salary that they offered is very less ... . . dont accept less than 6000-8000 + accomdation + transport .
you will have to go and collect it from them ... its usually ready after 3 working days ...
you 'll have to go there personally to collect it . . it should be ready by now . .
Hello This happened with my family visit case also , i went personaly there with family and ask about this case , then they put a stamp over the receipt and on the same day i went to Immigration and done the extention -LRB- Garrafa -RRB- Regards
No need to go . They should send you an sms to the number which you mentioned while applying , informing about readiness and send the results directly to immigration . We have our med.com . done before Eid in this way . But maybe they forgot about you ... .
Go ahead , arrange for party !! This vehicle is very popular , keeps its value , almost nil maintenance for 10 years ... Just fill fuel & drive ... you wont need to open the bonnet for 5 years ...
Let the service centre mechanics do it . Redpama can read newspapers during that time at the reception area of the dealership , haha .
Go ahead if you do n't mind people standing by the road side gesturing at you to stop taking their chances that you could serve them as a private taxi ; -RRB-
IBQ is still the highest that i know of with 3 % on QAR accounts . Minimum deposit of QAR 10,000
Just had a look at IBQ . Can get 3 % on QAR , USD , GBP or EUR . Unbelievable actually . Is there a catch do you think ? Is there a deposit guarantee scheme in Qatar like the usual banking countries ?
3 % wins it , includes other currencies too . What 's the catch ?
i open a saving account in mashreq -- they are telling intrest only in east saver account not in saving account

Rizks is our baywatch lifeguard for the bbq day : P
m gon na wear Purple Speedos !
dont wear henna on your hair at nights . if you have put it in your hands ever , you 'll feel how cooling it is , as same it will be for your head where you might catch a cold :-RRB- if you are going to a beauty parlor , make sure you go so some place safe as many of the beauticians put chemicals in to the henna mixture to bring out the color -LRB- to make the color dark as well to make it durable on the skinn -RRB- . why i 'm telling you is that once i went to a henna artist & after a few days the skin on both my hands & legs were cracked . so i rang up her back to check whats going on & then she told me of the chemicals story . i have done this quite alot of times . its fascinating sometimes :D all the best !
Creating a thread for posting something is boring .

There are lots of shops selling henna in doha . . and they come from different countries . .
oh NO iffs now rizks has your number expect amazing !
many bootyparlours sells them , even in some markets you will find them in packets and in cones ... Henna -LRB- Lawsonia inermis , also called caca tree -LSB- 1 -RSB- -RRB- is a flowering plant used since antiquity to dye skin , hair , fingernails , leather and wool . The name is also used for dye preparations derived from the plant , and for the art of temporary tattooing based on those dyes . Additionally , the name is misused for other skin and hair dyes , such as black henna or neutral henna , which are not derived from the plant . by the way , you can always use Google seach for anything ! : -RRB-
Searching my dear ... but always good to discuss with people who know and experience the henna since we got da discussion room is n't it ; P
okie dokie ... infact there are 2 kinds henna , one which can be used for the Hairs and the other to put on the hands , legs etc. . . Once you land here , just visit any beauty parlours and ask them to put henna design on ur hands , i promise you will jus lov it ! : -RRB-
for once Rizks is actually giving out some useful information ... however i 'm shocked that he knows so much about henna for hair treatment since he has no hair to begin with . : P
hahaha such a nice shoot smoke ... Rizks , i wan na try as well ... anyway u guy are up early today ...
We are forced to be up early ... coz we are in office : P
Early in the office but posting on QL ... great !! What kind of office or job you all guys have . And before you shoot me , my office starts at 9 AM ... : -RRB-
Prism happens everywhere , we come to office and we order our coffee , check our emails , help the community by posting on QL :P and then we do our work .
there is no specific provision on the labor law which states your claim unless there is an agreement between you and your company . the end of service gratuity is 3 weeks pay for every year of service . Article -LRB- 54 -RRB- In addition to any sums to which the worker is entitled to upon the expiry of his service , the employer shall pay the end of service gratuity to the worker who has completed employment of one year or more . This gratuity shall be agreed upon by the two parties , provided that it is not less than a three-week wage for every year of employment . The worker shall be entitled to gratuity for the fractions of the year in proportion to the duration of employment . The worker 's service shall be considered continuous if it is terminated in cases other than those stipulated in article -LRB- 61 -RRB- of this Law and is returned to service within two months of its termination . The last basic wage shall be the base for the calculation of the gratuity . The employer is entitled to deduct from the service gratuity the amount due to him by the worker .
You need to have strong evidence to support ur case ... ask your friend if he/she wants his father to be deported along with his partner . If found guilty he might have to serve a jail term before being deported ... i dont think embassy will entertain such cases . U can take help from the police .
She should talk to his Father , to clarify this issue , before anything else .
Talk to your father , tell him the facts , and tell him to behave himself otherwise you and your siblings and your mother will disown him.Make sure that he is not married in secret ! .
leave it to their family to make a decision .
Unless he is banging your ... . . you have nothing to do with it , and based on the fact that you are asking about this here in QL just proves the point that you are as dumb as you seem to be .
Thats quite a balancing act to be done by your friend before he needs to report to the authority . Lets suppose that your friend is totally dependant on his father to support his family financially then there will be no choice to loose him out . The best option is to talk to the father to advise him what he did was morally wrong and if he has a strong religious back ground , than that would be an advantage to convince him out
Mind your own business and do n't interfere in other 's family matters .
There 's always 3 sides to a story - his side , her side and reality . So , as the others said - better let things be sorted out privately or the repercussions could be so much greater , affecting you also . Think further before you act .
Friendly speaking , it 's good for you because you care for your friend . However , you have to consider the consequences before making any action . You may worsen the situation or somewhat solve the problem . In my opinion , as a friend do n't ever interfere on a family matters . Perhaps , you can advise your friend how to deal with it and solve the issue internally without involving the authorities.godbless
Buddy , this is not ur life . . U ca n't interfere in others life no matter how close u r to him/her . . let ur frd to decide what he wan na do . .
Just shut up .

Last I heard -LRB- and from everything I have read about Qatar -RRB- was that officially stamps from Israel in your passport were a big no-no . That said , I do n't know that they check for it really -- maybe more bark than bite . The Israeli trade office closed in January ... `` Most plain girls are virtuous because of the scarcity of opportunity to be otherwise . '' -- Maya Angelou
You might get lucky and the stamp would be overlooked , but I would n't count on it . Signature line > `` You ca n't fix stupid ''
Not a problem . Mandi
Nothing is a problem until it gets noticed . Just be prepared to be rejected and on the next plane out if it is . Signature line > `` You ca n't fix stupid ''
The official position of Qatar is that it is not a problem . Mandi
You will loose your money ; experienced ;
I saw at villagio carrofour where they sale the fresh flower
Besides this one , do you know of any other place , because it seems they are very expensive there .
I have been here for 3 years and have never seen a live real Christmas tree here . This is an Islamic country you know ... They barely tolerate us celebrating our religious holidays , I do n't think they are going to accept shipments of fir trees .
sorry to say MikaylasMom . . but you can . . remember this is Qatar not Saudi
I do n't think Qatar minds you celebrating Christmas . What is n't acceptable is the Christmas Celebrations and Decorations which have invaded our Malls , Restaurants , and Lives . Nothing big .
You could find X'mas decorations at Dreamz shopping centre at the Airport road . They have loads and very reasonable .
Police clearance from country of origin and country of residence . Having NOC doesnt mean that he will be able to change jobs . That is at the hands of the immigration to approve or deny .
I know all your friends ... tell which friend is leaving our company -LRB- QL -RRB- ;-RRB- BTW ... 1 . NOC Depends upon company 's HR policy . 2 . Read labor contract and ensure competition clause is followed . 3 . Police clearance certificate from respective embasssy . 4 . Maximum number of transfer/s allowed within Qatar is three -LRB- including the current one -RRB- ... ensure that new job is really attractive -LRB- financially -RRB- and beneficial -LRB- careerwise -RRB- in the long run . All the BEST ; -RRB-
Victory why only 3 ? Or is it 3 in one year ? Or do they expect a person to work for only one `` master '' all his life ? What a gloomy future for employees ?
jack that is the rule but not strictly enforced . It depends on the person and kind of job

Hiya ! Im pretty sure you can but I 'll look when Im in the supermarket ! Happy move planning !
I ' am working in one hypermart here in purchasing dept but we really not have a sma milk .

Breast Milk Still Best for Babies ! ... HOOYAH !
thanks hannah981
right , some people tell me you can get sma in megamart but it wasnt there today - things are like that here - when they are they buy lots cos it may not be there again . In carrefour they had semilac , nestle , aptamil , pediasure ensure and wyeth . On the Sma website it links to wyeth - I dont know if they are made by the same company but apparently they are equivalent . If you google sma and the countries it is in it directs you to wyeth for some countries including qatar . These brands all seem to be readily available in the shops and were in a few different shops so should be easy to get hold of . If you research SMA maybe it is the same as the wyeth ?? If your little one has to have sma and the link with wyeth goes nowhere then I would ship it but it 'll be fairly expensive . I guess the only alternative is to try to switch to something else thast you can get here gradually before you come so you dont have a mare when you get here ? Wish you all the best with the move and the baby . My research is just testament to how bored I am as I have not yet found a job . I am also in healthcare and it seems hard for westerners to get those kind of jobs here !
brian , do u know this thread was posted in the year 2009 ?? so it means that the person has already moved in here . . right ??? it 's too late for ur reply buddy . .
extract from official ARR website http://www.arrahman.com/v2/: Live Concerts Watch A.R.Rahman perform live 24th Oct - Hyderabad , GMR International Airport 14th Nov - Calcutta 3rd Dec - Muscat 8th Jan - Doha Qatar
I would definitely go for Ar Rahman 's concert if he lands here !!
consert is on 8th JAN 2010
bad luck for me . . we already booked tickets to india during that period we will be in india . . just let me know if the dates get changed
His concert will be free in Sydney ... So therefore it should be the same in Doha as well : -RRB-

I think you should convert to muslim or he should left the Muslim religion and convert to Christian . its better to have the same religion with your partner in this way you will have the same faith .
i have a new software rligion_converter 2.012 issue 2009-2010 updated online freeware to convert from any religion to any other religon . you can find it on www.extremereligionconverter.com/marriagetomuslim Yalla !
are you crazy !!
He loved you the way you are , you do n't have to change a thing about you ! However ; I recommend to read about Islam to get to know it , even if you do n't convert , you 'll learn how things works for a better long-lasting relationship ! & I 'm happy for you !!! Real love nowadays is kinda rare to find ! '' Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you did n't do than by the ones you did do . So throw off the bowlines . Sail away from the safe harbor . Catch the trade winds in your sails . Explore . Dream . ` Discover '' Mark Twain
Converting BECAUSE YOU 'RE IN LOVE with the SOMEONE is NOT REALLY a valid point . It is your belief and faith that should be the major factor why you want to convert . Ok , let 's say you converted to your BF 's religion : what if in the long run , you guys broke up ? You mean , you will go back to your former religion ? What is BF doing to prove his love for you ? JM28 asked you a Question whether THIS BF has any plans of marrying you . or maybe he 's just using you . Be wise ... like they say , love is blind . <aÂ href=http://www.glitter-graphics.com> < img src = `` http://dl4.glitter-graphics.net/pub/789/789734c9hsuc4ab6.gif '' width = 326 height = 163 border = 0 > </a> <br> < a href = `` http://www.glitter-works.org '' target = _ blank > </a> <aÂ href=http://www.glitter-graphics.com> < i
if he loves you to be his wife that is alright religion does n't matter but before going in process of marriage u both have to understand each others cultural respects and make predecision of where u both have to live .
azilana7037 well said

FU ur previous avatar was better :-RRB-
RELIGION IS NOT THE BIG PROBLEM AS LONG YOU LOVE EACH OTHER AND BOTH OF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION.RESPECT BOTH OPENION AND BELIEF THATS IT .
Pray to god for guidance and trust your heart . Reflect on what marriage means and give a thought to your future if you do not convert and have children . This seems to be the biggest problem in these relationships . You may both be secure in your individual faiths , but your children may suffer . Sorry to bring in a down point , just want to be a sincere advisor to you .
Does religion really matters to you then why at the first place enter into a relationship ! It is your personal call ... mutually agree or compromise decide before marriage .
Convert if you believe in Islam otherwise plenty of ways to show that you care .
He knows I care . And hes open to Christianity . I dont really care about the religion aspect in relationships . . Its not quite my forte
Get him . Marry him . You convert or you dont convert thats upto you . <imgÂ src=http://www.qatarliving.com/files/images/Da.gif>
Do not convert to please people . Religion is not about pleasing people . Its about pleasing GOD !
I dont care about pleasing people . I know I have the ability to please everybody , it 's just if their worthy of being pleased or not is the question .
Because you dont deserve to be pleased by me .
He has the right to ask you to convert and you have the right to accept or no . If a christian woman fall in love with a muslim man then they can marry and the Muslim man should not force her . But really if you love him you should tell him that you are willing to know about Islam , then you can marry him and who knows maybe you will convert . You can marry him and he should not force you at all .
If you convert you will please yourself first and you may marry this man .
anyways , in true love , religion should never be an issue ... boston is correct , just show him that you really love and care . <aÂ href=http://photobucket.com/images/dragon%20gifÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://i145.photobucket.com/albums/r202/mooncapsule/Caro%20perso/dragon-ball-z2049.gifÂ border=0Â alt=dragon-ball-z%20(49).gifÂ Pictures,Â ImagesÂ andÂ Photos/> </a>
before you think of converting , ask him first if he plans to marry you and ask him to let you meet his parents ... from that point you can think of converting or not <aÂ href=http://www.qatarliving.com/user/greentea> <imgÂ src=http://lc.fdots.com/cc/lc/78/780fbc341ac46d9fc618695ae3c23eaf.jpgÂ border=0Â alt=MyHotComments.com> </a> <br> < a href =
Even if he plans to marry does n't mean that he is going to marry you !
Especially not , when he is an Egyptian !
please do not revert for love , marriage or friendship . if you want to convert into any religion , take your time , study about that religion , once you satisfied yourself , then you can proceed for reverting to Islam . Otherwise dont do it ... as your thread it is very well known that , you are in deep love with him ... in my opinion religion doesnt matter at all ... wishing you a successfull marriage life ...
Who said anything about being Egyptian Boston ? What would happen when a Red Quark and a Green Quark love eachother though ?

There 's an unlock released for the 5.14.02 check it out here ... me trying it now http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=iv&annotation_id=annotation_324853&v=HOIpwIzimw4
Ok just an update finally got the phone back on track . U of Mich , there is now a unlock for the 4.2 iOs currently running on 4.2 and base band 06.15.00 . Follow the above link I posted should work fine took me a while but it 's finally out and running enjoy
Khanan you wont lose any of your apps if you make a back up of them and restore . I have not lost anything . The only issues with the upgrade was that damn baseband which got upgraded along with the 4.1 ver . Anyways you are not missing much with the upgrade so if you dont need it dont upgrade :P I like to make my life complicated thats why i did it LOL
Smoke . Thanks Is youe Wifi working correctly ? How about Bluetooth , is it working . By saying reboot what do you mean ? I think you meant to say Power Cycle -LRB- meaning if you battery get drained you have to unlock it with Redsn0w -RRB- ... RIGHT ? So you have new OS4 .2 with baseband 06.15.00 now and it was simple to unlock with the help of above video . Is there any tricky step you have to be carefull about ? Thanks for your feedback . UofMich
Thanks a lot . I will try and let you about my experience .
Smokie 's is the -LRB- Cha -RRB- i Phone ... made in China : - P
bought it from someone here on QL , it was jailbroken before running on version 4.0.1 .
Hello Smoke , FirmWare 05.14.02 , can not be unlocked for other carrier , once phone upgraded to os4 .1 its firmware automatically changed to 05.14.02 . There is no way you can down grade to previous firmware . phone with os4 .1 can be jailbroken with limera1n , carriee unlock is not possible as of now . Dev Team is working on it but no solution as yet .
U of Mich. . . what are you saying i cant go back to my previous iOS ???? I 'm sure there is a way out of this , just want to go back to my previous 4.0.1 thats it . there 's nothing great with the 4.1 release anyways :P Whats this about upgrading the baseband ? WTF is that ?
YES you can downgrade to OS4 .0.1 , but firmware that is 05.14.02 NO . Operatiing System -LRB- OS -RRB- and Firmwars -LRB- Baseband -RRB- are two different things . you can play around with OS but once firmware -LRB- baseband -RRB- upgraded to 05.14.02 , it can not be change as of NOW . I am sorry but that is correct you can not use your phone until there is a new tool become available on internet .
Well this is what i found on the net : How to Downgrade iOS 4.1 -LRB- Baseband 05.14.2 -RRB- to iOS 4.0 -LRB- Baseband 05.13.4 -RRB- Using Fuzzyband 1 . Launch Cydia from your springboard , and go to systems under section tab 2 . Press to select 3G Fuzzyband Downgrader from the list of packages & click on install . 3 . After installation is completed successfully return to cydia and press home button and launch Fuzzyband . 4 . A message will be displayed if your bootloader is not supported , If you have the 5.08 bootloader you will be able to downgrade from baseband 05.12.01 . Press the Downgrade button to begin downgrading your baseband . 5 . Once the downgrade has completed successfully you will be displayed a Done ! message saying , I Haz Downgrade ! Now if i downgrade it to 5.12.01 will my phone work with Qtel ?

It 's possible to stay in Qatar for a long time , but you have to behave .
loool Arien ! -- tEaCh Me RuLeS , i 'Ll TeAcH hOw To BrEaK iT . . rMs . . !!
Let 's put it this way , why would Qatar want to retain a visitor who not only fights in bars but raises enough ruckus to get arrested fighting in bars ? I think they do n't want his kind here . Mandi
If you are on Visit visa status and have been over staying in Qatar problems are your passport might have been given to the CID by your agency ex . Fahad , cleopatra and evryday of lapse visa will be equivalent to a certain fine . They will ask you to pay a certain amount to get your passport so you can get back to your home country . If your question is arresting you in some criminal offense like carrying dangerous alcohol , drugs etc. then yes you might be deported.In some cases your relatives or friends in Doha will not even know you have been deported .
arrested for fighting in bars
maybe caught doing illegal activity . then you will be deported and banned from entering Doha again
So does anyone know the answer ?
stealth , fighting in bars is legal ?
why dont you call 999 and confirm it yourself MD ?
I hate to wait , stealth . And I have n't been in a bar since 15 years . Do n't plan to go either .
you have to follow the employment contract . the law will be followed if there is no provision for this subject . and also as long as the provision in the employment contract is not axactly unconscionably against the law , then the employment contract should prevail .
thanks Amici for your reply ... but the point is that the law seem to say that less than 1 year = 1 week !?!? - You should never underestimate the predictability of stupidity -
i agree with Amici ... as u have already agreed with the terms of ur employment contract the time u joined therefore ur empl contract should prevail . . !!!
hmmm . . i dont have a contract with my employer . . on employment offer . . the notice is atleast a month or a week but you see ... they only gave me few hours . . hows that ??
It is according to the contract . But remember , If you have not completed two years in the country , you can not change sponsorship .

suri Since you have a month to stay here . Please visit souk Wafeek -LRB- old souk -RRB- with your dad . This is the place most tourist goes . After that check out Vilaagio Mall , City Center and Pearl . In my opinion those are only places that worth visit . If you are up to adventure , try desert safari tour or sand motor bike in Mae Saeed . Looking at your post that is the location of your dad works . there are two korean restaurants , Moon Palace and Korean Garden . For my taste , I prefer Moon Palace but it will be difficult to park therefore , try KOrean Garnden . it is located near same road as Ramada hotel so it 'll be hard to miss
yes , google it . Lol !!! `` Do n't let a little dispute injure a great friendship ''

Sarvodaya in Madinat Khalifa South Donbosco in Bin Omran both run by Indians PM if u need contact # or details
Sarvodaya charges is Qrs .1200 / - pm . Try smartkids back of TownCentre . Little nursery Qrs .1800 / - .
Hey where is Donbosco ?
Tariq - Donbosco -LRB- Al Khulud -RRB- near Al Meera Area in Bin Omran Check ur facts before giving figures in public . Fees depend on the time per day ur kid spend there My kid was there in Sarvodaya last year for QR 400 pm , it might have changed but i do n't think ur figures r right
Yes even I heard that the fees in Sarvodaya is somewhere around QR 400-600 pm.Its closeby to my residence but am not keen on putting my son there.I did not get very good response about the way they take care.But i will surely try Donbosco.Please correct me if am wrong.Some more responses are wolcome .
Sarvodaya in Bin Mahmoud charge Qrs .400 / - . But When I went to inquire the rate , authorities said the rate for 7-17 hours . In case if you can show me a cash receipt , then I can go back and ask the rate again . Figures are given in good faith and I am not taking any personal benefit out of it .
If your company is a Q company they can apply for your Visa and bring you back to Doha within a few weeks as your husbands visa is cancelled . Check this with your Company PRO ...

thanks for all the replies my husband was told that he has one month to settle his condition that is why i think i can transfer , his company is refusing to give him a NOC after 8 years of working with them , it is really very hard specially that we paid the tuition for kids for next year
First u need to take NOC from ur husband to present it to ur company stating that he wo n't mind transferring ur status to COMPANY VISA . . Secondly , yes ur husband can come to QATAR on visit visa . . Ur last question is bit tricky for me . . I do n't have accurate answer to reply u. . . I m not sure whether u can sponsor ur kid and helper or not . . I think if ur salary meets all the criteria , i do n't see ne pblm in it . . But kindly wait for other QLers to give u more precise answer . .
Transfer ur Husband visa to some other Local company 's and pay monthly to them until getting another Job ... . He can take NOC from the company once he found Job ... there are many MEP company 's are available for this !!
You can get it transferd to ur husband , if ur salary is good enough to sponser husband definitely can come

A professor at the University of Tottenham was giving a lecture on Paranormal Studies . . To get a feel for his audience , he asks : `` How many people here believe in ghosts ? '' About 90 students raise their hands . `` Well , thats a good start . Out of those who believe in ghosts , do any of you think you have seen a ghost ? '' About 40 students raise their hands . . `` Thats really good . I 'm really glad you take this seriously . Has anyone here ever talked to a ghost ? '' About 15 students raise their hands . . `` Has anyone here ever touched a ghost ? '' 3 students raise their hands ... `` Thats fantastic . Now let me ask you one question further ... Have any of you ever made love to a ghost ? '' Way in the back , MarcoNandoz-01 raises his hand . The professor takes off his glasses and says : `` Son all the years I 've beee giving this lecture , no one has ever claimed to have made love to a ghost . You 've got to come up here and tell us about your experience . '' Middle Eastern MarcoNandoz-01 replied with a nod and a grin , and began to make his way up to the podium . When he reached the front of the room , the professor asks : `` So MarcoNandoz-01 , tell us what its like to have sex with a ghost ? '' MarcoNandoz-01 replied : `` Oh Shyte , from way back there , i thought you said Goats ''
Knight : When you see a ghost , will you go there & say hello ? Which sane person will do that ? Definitely not me . How it look like ? Only the head is visible . No heads , legs , body etc. . Hope I answered yr Q.
Definitely not complete darkness . There was light although it 's night time . . and I am widely AWAKE . Like I 've said . . if you have not seen / experience it then you would say it does n't exist .

Well , strange spirits have been apart of out family for some time . They are very helpful to us . lol I have never experienced these spirits myself but specific family members have repeatedly spoken about their encounters . 1 . Grandmother was about to be hit by a bus . And ` somebody ' picked her up and moved her out of the way . Turned around to say thanks but mysteriously no one was there . 2 . Grandmother again when she was a child was in her room when a fire started . Freaked out as she was a strange spirit -LRB- what she thought was an angel -RRB- came down and told her ' `` Do n't be afraid . '' And she calmed down and she sat down not being afraid . Until her father came breaking down the door screaming like `` What the hell is the matter with you !!! '' But she just said , `` I am not afraid . '' :D 3 . Great Grandmother was about to touch a high voltage wire until she sees this ` angel ' spirit sitting right in front of it ! 4 . My Aunt is a little different hers are more like freaky strange spirits not as helpful as the others . :D Her 's are more disturbing the peace by shutting and slamming doors randomly around the house . And many more of other stories of such experiences . Some are indeed friendly ghosts though ! :D
Always shocked to see seemingly functional adults talking gibberish and mumbo jumbo ... Ghosts ? Please , who in their right minds would believe it ? Why ? You die , but your still alive just nobody can see you and you comminicate by flickering the lights and moving objects when nobody is looking ... Absurd !
Yes , I believe in Jinns ...
I do n't really have an issue with women believing , but a grown man !? C'mon ! Having said that - I think I was attacked by a Succubus in my sleep once . About 4 years ago . . It was real
Manna , I have been trying to get an appointment with a ghost but I guess all are too busy for me ...
Knight : Got to a haunted house at night . You may just be lucky .
n_minie , a haunted house may induce some fear in people but frankly I would love to spend a night there . It would be a lifetime experience ... either way . During our college days , a junior female student committed suicide in a lake which was inside our college campus . For many months after the incident some of us tried to go there late nights if her ghost would tell us the real story !! Well , we were not matured then and we seriously thought we could solve this case talking to her ghost . Now I laugh at myself for being so stupid .

Buy tickets for the hop-on/hop-off open top buses - you can get on and off as much as you want and there are 4 different tour routes so you can see almost all of the best sites for a reasonable price.I can recommend the Royal Magda Hotel near the Arc de Triomphe - small but spotlessly clean . Climb to the top of the Arc de Triomphe for a fantastic view of the Champs Elysses and Paris-it 's better than the view from the Eiffel Tower . Beware of pickpockets and scam artists particularly in the Sacre Coeur area . Keep your wallet under your shirt next to your body.Have a great trip . > May your dreams take you travelling all through your life .
When arriving in Paris you can take the Air France shuttle bus into Paris from the airport and it will drop off at the Arc de Triomphe where you can get ataxi to your accomodation.Its cheaper and safer than taking a taxi or the metro . > May your dreams take you travelling all through your life .
If you do take the Metro from CDG , have some coins with you because the ticket vending machines do n't accept notes , and the queue to the ticket counter can be very long .
I recommend you visit Louvre Museum to see what Napoleon has stolen from Egypt . . very interesting stuff though ... For food , try Noura restaurant for fine Arabic food . . two branches , one in Chapms Elysee and the the other one off the Opera station ... La Defense is another nice place for walking and wondering about . . Try also the latin square and the Arabic cultural centre which has interesting history remarks . . it is also close the the Bastil ... Eiffel Tower is nice but do n't climb it if you have heights phobia . . surroundings is enough beauty . . Do n't go to Pigale area at night . . it becomes unstable . . I am sure you heard of De Triumph Arch so do n't miss it . . you can get up to its top . . nice for fotos . . Have a safe journey . .

Lucky you . I have planned a trip to paris but never had the oporunity to execute it , the most helpful sights are Paris.com & france.com , everything you need to know is there .
My husband & I went there for 2 days by train from Switzerland -LRB- part from our honeymoon -RRB- . and I found out 2 days were enough and wo n't go there again . We 've stayed at Hotel Plaza Athenee , which has a view of the Eiffel Tower . It was lovely & it is the same hotel that Sarah Jessica Parker stayed in in one of `` Sex & the city '' episodes . Of course going on top of Eiffel Tower is great . and we went there early in the morning to avoid the long lines . also : * Louvre * Arc de Triomphe * Versai Palace * Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Paris * old down town Paris * If you have kids 1 day in Disneyland , otherwise I do n't recommend it . * A walk in the Champs-Elysees street . which has number of cafe 's & restaurants . make sure to stand in the middle of the street & take picture of the Arc de Triomphe I always do a research on Yahoo travels . there are lots of useful reviews and recommendations for hotels , things to do & restaurants .

having been to Paris twice now . 1 . Buy a guide book -- they have several at Jarir or Virgin . 2 . Agree with above poster : A. Sacre Coeur better than Notre Dame . I also like Saint Chapelle better , which is only about a block from Notre Dame . B. Metro is fabulous C. Lourve is huge , just run to your favorites and skip the rest . D. I enjoyed Versailles , especially the grounds . E. Eiffel Tower lines can be long or short depending on day and time . If super long , then leave and come back later . F. Walk around in the Jardin des Tuileries .

You should plan it very well so that you do n't waste any of your time there . Search in the internet what places in Paris would be very interesting for you . I suggest , t he best place to view Eiffel Tower is in Tocadero . Try to find , a map that will guide you on how to use the Metro system in France . If you have plan of going to Disneyland , one day is n't enough if you have kids . I hope this is useful enough and enjoy !
AAaaaaaaaaaaaaaah ! Gay Pareee ... What memories : -RRB-
Make sure you visit the catacombs , which are underground tunnels stuffed with human bombs . Creepy , but very interesting . Notre Dame is interesting , but Sacre Couer is my favorite by far . If you 're not really into art then the Lourve can prove to be an expensive waste of time . It 's HUGE , and it can take you hours to find the stuff you really want to see . The Musee D'Orsay is a much smaller gallery with a much more focussed collection of impressionist masterpieces . Get to know the Metro system , it is an amazing way to get around . The Palais Garnier is an underrated attraction . Hopefully you can visit on a day that is operating tours . I really enjoy the restaurants in the Marais area , if you 're looking for some place to eat .
Few more tips , if you still have n't traveled yet . For Music visit : Palais Garnier . For Shopping and reasonably priced souvenirs visit : Lafayette and Rue de la Huchette -LRB- this oldest street has lots of yummy shawerma -RRB- CuriousButDetermined on the Louvre : `` see what Napoleon has stolen from Egypt '' , the same applies to the British Museum , it contains the largest Egyptian antiquities collection , confiscated by the British army back in the days .

Tip # 2 - If you have a car , get a good tourist book which will tell you where and where not to park . Tip # 3 - Learn a bit of French . A great book which has a lot of basic phrases and fun things to try is Rick Steves ' handy pocketbook guide to basic French -LRB- find book -RRB- Tip # 4 - Use the Metro -LRB- the subway -RRB- . There is simply no better way to get around Paris . But make sure you 've brushed up on your French . It will help with buying tickets and understanding the maps in the subways . Tip # 5 - The lines and crowds at the Eiffel Tower can get very long . If you must see the lights of Paris at night -LRB- and you should -RRB- Go on a week night -LRB- not Friday -RRB- , or make reservations . TIP # 6 - The Louvre . From what I understand , if you are an art lover and really appreciate art museums , you could spend weeks there , but for most people , half a day is enough time . You see the famous pictures -LRB- Mona Lisa -RRB- , and spend some time looking at the amazing art . if you go on Sunday morning and get there as they 're opening , it 's free admission . TIP # 7 - If there is one place that is absolutely crazy to drive in Paris , it 's in the roundabout that goes around the Arc D'Triomphe . If you rent a car and drive here , just go travelling around in your car like you would if there were no rules . TIP # 8 - There are lots of wonderful museums in France ! One of them is the Pantheon , which was originally a church , and originally planned to be something other than that . Victor Hugo and some other famous French people are buried there . Make sure you set aside some time and some money to visit the museums if that 's something you want to do . TIP # 9 - Have some small change -LRB- or large change if you can afford it -RRB- on hand for the street performers . They 're pretty good ! TIP # 10 - If you like looking at the inside of churches , take some time for Notre ' Dame , and if you have a problem with crowds , do n't go on the weekend . People were pretty respectful inside the cathedral on the weekdays , but there are a lot of people there on the weekends , so you end up waiting in line , and it gets more noisy inside . TIP # 11 - If you want to see the Eiffel Tower light up and sparkle at night , get there right before the hour . TIP # 12 - If you see a person on the street who is selling something and wants to sketch you or give you something for free , do n't be fooled by talk which says they 'll so something for free . IT IS N'T FREE ! __________________________________________ <b> Attitudes are more important than facts ... </b>
happy happy ... why did i fooled you guys ??? I was asking the tips about going to Paris before our summer hols . And we went to Paris last summer :-RRB-
bastok why wouldt you want to go to paris again ? its such a great city . i went to there 3 times and still dont have enough of it . its one of my favorite cities in europe . onece i went as a single with friends on the TGV . -LRB- fast trin from switzerland , direct to gare de lion -RRB- went 2 times with hubbi once also on the TGV and the 3rd time we had a 6 hours drive from bern to paris . every time it was an excitment . with Gods help , next time will be definatly to disneyland with my kids . action speaks louder than words
Novi , I know you 've been there . It 's just that your post title had nadt and myself think you were offering free tickets to your poor QL friends . Salam
Happy Happy ... ah ... I have to wrote a post that make people want to open it ... Marketing ploy you see :P
Well monsieur Klahmer , on doit pas parler francais pour visiter Paris , there are no laws that states france is only for those who speaks french . BTW ppl Mr. Klahmer is writing in french which means -LRB- it is not neccessary to visit Paris if you dont speak franch -RRB- . Please Mr. Klahmer have some integrity and write in english so that every one will understand , have some respect towards our phelow QLrs
If you have driving liciense , you can purchase cars without any letter from your sponsor.To get the liciense you already have got the letter to submit in the driving school , now u r entitled to own a car , go ahead , wish you all the best .
U need an NOC from ur sponsor , even if u have a driving licence .
1 . Select a car of ur choice . 2 . Take it to computer checking . 3 . Once u r satisfied with the test , negotiate the price . 4 . Go to Muroor with the letter from ur sponsor , Id card , QR250 and the owner of the car , to transfer it to ur name . Take an ATM or credit card as they do n't accept cash . Muroor has typing centre , where u will type the form in arabic , with ur details and cars .
We too have a secondhand car . . first thing we did was , request an NOC from our sponsor since this was needed when we had the process of car transfer , photocopies of ID 's ... Just make sure the car you are buying is in very good condition and the insurance or Istimara are valid for another -LRB- 3-6 mos -RRB- , 1 year is better . That way you have ample time to have it check or no more cash are going out of your pocket for repair . One more thing . . check if the car has any traffic violation before the transfer that way the first owner will pay it . . on our case we just found out day after that the car has violation on the same day we got the car ... too bad for us -LRB- we tried to request for photo -RRB- to check if it 's really our car but the police ca n't present any proof cause it 's a parking violation and it 's the mobile police who noted it . We paid it & we do n't want to argue anymore . . just had it on the wrong time ; the violation was made in a place we never visited and the owner of the car already left the country . Anyway goodluck on your new car .
Yes , baldrick2dogs is correct . I asked them the same thing and received the same answer .
I was been cancelled before then recently came back to Doha . After I inquired with my previous bank , they gave me the same bank account as my previous one . Same thing with Q-tel , I applied for new connection and still they asked me to pay my outstanding bill which is under my ID number -LRB- I did not pay before my arrears since it is just less than 300 QR -RRB- . Therefore , they will not cancel your account even if your work visa is cancelled .
They do n't have time to update / cancel the a/c 's of left peoples coz . . they are running with short of time to give proper in time service to the existing costomers .
i agree with yoiu that they dont update the data . but dont force me to beleive they give excellent service to exsitng customers . . it is a matter of technology how to be used . If yoiu go out of your country after visa cancellation without repaying the loan , how they catch you at airport ? ... so if they want to update data , they do it ,
<p> Ok thanks . Just a bit confused as I am looking at which TV package to get and am looking at the package deals that the Qtel shop is offering . They only seem to include `` Show Sport 2 , 3 and 4 '' as part of the OSN package , even on the OSN Premier Plus package ?! </p> <p> Can you recommend somewhere where I can get the channels that include the Rugby World Cup ? </p> <p> Thanks a lot . </p>
<p> Any recommendations on which TV package to get and where from to get the Rugby World Cup is appreciated . Thanks . </p>
<p> if you get the OSN package -LRB- Sports -RRB- it includes all sport chanels 2,3 and 4 ... get the HD box if you can then you 'll get the HD chanel which is showing the WC games in HD ... if not its still been shown on 2,3 and 4 . </p>
<p> Thank you for your answer . Where do you buy the HD box and package from in Doha ? </p> <p> I went to the Qtel store in the Villagio -LRB- they could n't tell me any details , just gave me a list of packages they do -RRB- , but there must be some other shops/places that sell it ? </p>
<p> I got mine from star link in City Centre ... if you want to get the HD chanels then you need the OSN box . . </p>
I think it is OSN
def OSN , they have started advertising it !!! Carn the All Blacks !!
<p> Which channel of OSN exactly will be showing this ? Thanks </p>
i KNOW THAT : if ur company accepts and not ask u for money , u dont have to pay , but if they told u they will not accept to end ur work with them they will ask u and u should give them money , but here in qatar I think that u dont have to pay them if they still want u to work with them and they wil ask u for money thats if u came in ur hasbund visa
It 's possible to resign from the job within contract period . Well , this depends upon what your contract says . If your contract specifies that `` if you resign before agreed period then the expenses occured -LRB- for your training , visa , ticket etc. -RRB- would be born by you '' . Then yes , you have to pay the company expenses .
I have received the appointement letter but not contract . And it is not signed by the ministry . So the contract is valid or not ?
im applying for a job in qatar last month under one agency got this job in poea workabroad online job hiring.my agency told me ill wait for 1 week or a 2 its true ?
case to case it depends on your employer i got mine after 2.5 months -LSB- img_assist | nid = 21401 | title = Adjust , Adopt & Overcome | desc = | link = none | align = left | width = 180 | height = 135 -RSB-
I have been here last three months
Unfortunately Qatar is an undeveloped country . ` Good ' things are not in great demand . They rather go for cheap rubbish here .
I had to buy mine online from Amazon and have them shipped in . Signature line > `` You ca n't fix stupid ''
Almost every month I visit there and they sell Legos ! Original Legos ! Never forget to ask the salespeople over there ! `` Everything in this book may be wrong . '' Illusions : The Adventures of The Reluctant Messiah by Richard Bach
heero , i think OP referring to the just blocks ... plain blocks , not the one in the boxes building starwars ship or truck ...
in the Hallmark store in The Mall - pink and blue plastic tubs with maybe 250 piece sets inside . But I ended up having a friend who was visiting bring some back from Denmark . But I second what marycatherine said : order them online and ship them in . Doha is not a place that you depend upon for anything to be in stock anywhere . I wish I could drink like a lady . I can take one or two at the most . Three and I 'm under the table . Four and I 'm under the host '' -- Dorothy Parker
I have a whole bunch of old sets that i brought with me when I came . Will put them up for sale soon as I do n't fancy shipping them back .
was wondering if your old lego toys are already on sale , coz am interested . cant find lego blocks here in Doha .
if its a 2nd hand car your talking about , then do NOT go to the banks . Go to financing company , like Jazeera finance or First finance . They have much better rates & the model of the car does n't matter .
thanks for info i am the seller and i just want to know when i will get my payment , what is payment process ?
your car is thru car loan and you want to sell it ? the buyer must pay first , then you go to the bank to pay the car loan amount -LRB- full -RRB- , ask for the clearance from the bank for the full payment of the car loan . -LRB- 2days -RRB- once you have the clearance , you can proceed to traffic dept. for the transfer of ownership -LRB- seller and buyer -RRB- .
If you have a buyer already and he/she wants to pay your car from a bank loan ? He should first go to a car dealer , he will get a quotation from them -LRB- QR1000 fee -RRB- , take it to the bank . Bank will give him the money , he then pay you . After receiving the payment you can give him you car.Of course he will do all the transfer of ownership procedure .
thanks for useful info , the buyer wants to buy my car via car loan -LRB- Commercial Bank -RRB- , and the bank asked from buyer to bring the quotation from dealer which we provided already now , that is ok but bank is telling that they will make the payment to Dealer directly and than i will get my money from dealer , is it correct?i dont understand this part in case dealer does not want to pay it to me , where is my guarantee ?
Yes , you can sell your car . You have to take the buyer of your car to the bank and settle all your remaining amount in the bank plus pay you if the total price of the car beyond or higher than the remaining amount in the bank . After that process done , the bank will give out NOC to you for you to hand over the NOC to the new buyer for him to process with the traffic police department to change the ownership . You have to go along with the new buyer to the Insurance company to change the ownership before proceed to the traffic police department for changing the ownership and renewal of the registration card . Cheers . .
Dann is correct . You can either go to the registration dept first if the buyer feel un-secure and then go to the insurance company second . But first you must go to the bank along with you buyer to clear the outstanding amount before proceeding . If buyer has an account in the same bank , then bullseye ! your task is much easier .
If you look at the reverse -LRB- back -RRB- of your car registration card , at the right hand bottom you will see a column ` Type of Ownership ' in Arabic NOUGH ALMUKIA . If you have your banks name written there , you can not sale this car without a no objection letter from the bank .
you can ask better questions than that . <imgÂ src=http://www.qatarliving.com/files/images/Da.gif>
If it is like my site , you will not be allowed to connect your personal laptop to the company internet connection .

that 's why its called personal laptop , you 'll use it seperately even in the office . im sure they 'll provide you a company laptop or a desktop for your work .
Yes , we even have electricity here ! Of course you can bring your laptop when you visit but ask before using it for your work if that 's what you are doing here . As stated , you should only use QP equipment in QP areas but if yu are going to live here there are no restrictions for personal use
tnx guys by the way how about the villas I heard theres a problem with the availability of accomodation .
Impossible to comment on indivual 's circumstances . I suggest you speak to QP direct and ask them what accomodation is offered within our package , that way you know for sure . It 's a great place to live . JJ
Your old passport must have been cancelled when you renew it . Nobody is allowed to travel with cancelled or expired passport . You can give an allowance of at least one hour to transfer your RP to your new passport . The payment of that transaction is Qatari Riyals 110 .
You can travel with both passports , just because your old passport is cancelled doe n't make your RP cancelled . I had the same issue last year and just showed my RP in my old passport to immigration , this was n't a problem ... but arrange to have it transferred as soon as you can
you have transfer to the new passport , which will not take much time .
I agree with Raven1968 , take both when you travel , you will be fine in the way back .
HABIBMDH you dont HAVE to , its advisable you do ... I was travelling with my RP in my old passport for 4 months before my RP was renewed in my new passport , never once had a problem at immigration
Raven is correct - i have traveled with both passports ... as the RP had n't expired
Working Visa requires an exit permit to travel outside the country whereas family visa does not require any exit permit . To apply for an exit permit , a person needs a valid passport , not passports . I supposed Raven and Oryx are holding family visas .
Where is this done ? Can a person do it on they own or does the company have to do it for them ?
Since Windows 7 is just being released I would say `` do not install it yet '' and wait some time until you can get some feedback from those already using it . I know there is a way to have more than one OS in the HD and to have the PC/Laptop ask you with which OS you want to start , but in this case someone with more knowledge should give you a hand on that . I guess it is related to partition the HD and install each OS in each partition available ; thus it has to be a High Capacity HD . Regards !!
Well normally you get a back up disk which you can use to reinstall your original windows that came with your netbook , but sometimes its kept in a un accessable location on say your second partition . So first confirm that . To answer your questions YES you can install windows 7 and have Xp if you install them on two separate partitions . You dont want dual operating systems on your netbook then go ahead and just install Win7 you can always downgrade later without any problems , provided you have your Xp cd :-RRB-
appreciate that , , , thanks .
guys i only have this mini netbook , it does n't come with cd , so how can i install it back ? and how to do the partition you were saying ? sorry , dnt know much about lap . . thanks again .
thanks smoke , , , i appreciate that .
Better if you just stick with XP as miniPC were designed for if you like to try window 7 then upgrade your PC to higher one sell it and buy new . c , -RRB- cheersss !!!
Are you some kinda Qatar Embassador ? Go get a life and stop teaching me .
lol queen of the jungle is angry . chaud
Do you mind ?

nix , Qatar has 563 km of coastline . Take a 4-wheel drive and explore it . Go for camping in the desert and enjoy silence and millions of sparkling stars undisturbed from the city lights .
hasan , `` If you really want to enjoy life , Get married '' . . ... you must be kidding dude :-RRB- nix , there are a lot of ` like-minded ' and ` like-looking ' ppl in Doha ... just go to Sofitel area in the evening . . you wo n't be alone ... :-RRB- <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed .

Hasan , thanks for the correction . what i meant by ` like-minded people ' was jus tht - ppl . coz its always good to know sum1 in a new city . dint quite mean i want to hook up straightaway . qatarisun , i have a feeling ur advice has a catch to it , so r u going to tell me or i would have to find out for myself ? what happens at sofitel area anyways ?? alexa , lol i agree with u
Why do n't you concentrate on the ` official reasons ' instead ?
Bring your family with you and I can assure you , you shall have the time of your life .
You are going to come to one of the most boring places of the world where music sounds like zoo and zoo sounds like desert and desert sounds like jungle . Please stay in Dubai or whatever and try your level best to convince your organization with staying there only and not here .

Nix . `` dint quite mean i want to hook up straightaway '' , so you were expecting to get hooked later on . Very clever .
ok HASAN . . u have exposed my scheming ways ... now can v let this go :p
Som people say its too boring in Qatar and in their context the only places to go is CityCentre , Villagio , Mall , etc. . Khor al Udeid dunes , Corniche , Frij Nasr and Al Sadd , but beyond that there is lot to see in Qatar , though its geographically small . provided that you got time and amenities in weekend start discovering Qatar on your own or by group which i would say is lovely and worth . for intance you can log in http://www.qnhg.org/ -LRB- Qatar Natural History Group -RRB- who offers field trips to unknown places . .

Where would you find cow milk in other countries ???? Maybe the same ... In Supermarkets or from the Cow directly
How fresh do you want ? Only Camel 's milk is the most fresh in here .
I do n't suggest direct milk from the udder , that 's risky
Almarai / Nadec and few others all provide fresh milk in supermarket in 200ml / 500ml and upto 5Liters and dont be confused ; they are fresh milk with few days of expiry The one with the lable Long life is not fresh milk rest is fresh milk
If you are looking for own consumption , then go to any super/hyper market you will get , if you are looking for any business either for fresh milk or milk powder for business purpose then send me a pm i can help you for that .
they dont recruit locally

I 've read one question on Q & A section few days back where a chinese girl said that it 's really difficult for CHINESE to get visa in DOHA now ... i do n't know how far it is true . .
the list is too long to publish here ... so far only lebanese do n't have any problems whatsoever ...
are you looking for any visa ?
They will tell you there is no block and you just have to apply as normal ...
No , i m not looking for any visa now . Its for future plans .
you can not make plans for future in Qatar . Situations/rules/laws / surroundings/landscapes , etc. are changing drastically every moment . .

its more than enoguh . . you should look at all the poor ppl in the world and thank God for this offer and make sure u giev 2.5 % of ur savings as charity every year
I think it should be 10k US dollar for canadian national . But if 10k QAR then problem for you man ... ... can not be survived with kids and family and schooling ... ... ...
10k with kids ! no way near enough !
US10k per month for technical support ? I do n't think so ... it is most likely QR10k check is the company pays school fees - education is expensive here , so with QR10k per month it would be difficult .
I dont even think this is anyway near close to a family salary in Qatar . Honestly I 'd say stay in Canada if were talking about 10kQR because basically were saying about 3kCD or maybe a bit up or down -LRB- Not sure about the rate at the moment -RRB- . Whats your job description ? And what company has offered you ?
I really thank you guys for really great advice Here what I got offer yesterday salary 10.000 qr + housing 7000 + convence1000 yearly ticket 21 day leave with family medical So is this good offer or not . Appreciate for you advice
hi sameer how are you ? well sharing my experience , i would say 10k is less , try to locate the major expenditures , like doctor , schooling , or even include atleast once in a week dinner at some good place , buying a car and then its maintenance , if you ask me i would recommend you to negotiate with them for atleast 15k with house allowances , or ask them to provide company maintain car and family medicle , i am sure you must have good credentials ?
depends on your living style , doesnt seem very good for a family ...
This salary is absolute minimum for you to even sponsor your family . The school fees will completely use it up . What were you offered as a housing allowance ? Mandi
I agree with Mandi , without children and with a decent housing allowance the offer may be ok . But once school fees come into the equation I do n't know if the offer would be any use to you .

i am working in a private company running many institutions.i would like to know if there is rule in qatar labour law which states that if i take leave for 1 day due to personal reason on sunday i can join only on saturday loosing 6 days of salary for 1 day leave , they also reduce house allowance of six days since i am on leave for six days . please any one can guide me about which law the management is following . with regards dream team
google it
from thur or sunday depends
depends on the management , generally and as per labour law it is three working days starting from the first day of Eid , management of each company can extend it as per their policies
According to my secret agent it 's Friday , Saturday , and Sunday . Make sure your company gives you Sunday off !
plus the 26th and 27th - so it 's 5days Holidays !
As per labour law it is 3 working days and If you are not working normally on Saturdays then it will be possibly from Friday to Tuesday . If you are normally working on Saturdays it will be from Friday to Monday . Some Companies follow the labour law but there are a lot of Private Companies giving only one or two days .
`` As per labour law it is 3 working days . '' Is that the law ? Then I will insist on Sunday . Monday , and Tuesday off , and I will take Wednesday and Thursday , too , because it makes no sense to come in for two days . Thanks , cherukkan .
all the major car companies chrage the same here unless you have GCC coverage
I imported prado from Dubai an year ago and Toyota dealer asked the same . I am taking the vehicle to Tayseer service station and they are excellent . You can actually monitor what technician is doing . Make sure that he follows the maintenance schedule . Even if you flush the engine , change japan make oil filter and use mobile 10,000 Km oil it will not cost more than 300 QR where as in Toyota , the same with 5000 Km oil will cost around QR 800 1000 . Go to salwa road Tayseer and get the vehicle serviced in less than 2 hrs . In Toyota dealer it will take not less than one entire day .
Just noticed you said your car is one year old . For sure it is under warranty so check with Toyota Dubai to see if your warranty is valid at any Toyota dealer which it should be . It is possible that the story I relayed to you was in fact I believe either Toyota or BMW . If your warranty is valid I would definitely go to the proper authorities at the ministry of economy and commerce and report the Toyota dealer . MAke them service your vehicle under the conditions of the warranty you agreed to . Believe me they know what they are doing and they know it is wrong but yet they still try to bend the conditions to their liking . Make them honor the rules they have the responsibility to uphold . I am sure for every car they have to service from outside Qatar there is one that leaves they dont have to .
In addition to complaining to the Ministry , send a complaint to Toyota-Japan ; I 'm sure they do n't accept such crooked practices ; and if they do , never buy a Toyota again .
Other than American cars none of the other cars are provided GGC-Wide warranty . Check your documents . If you dont have GCC wide warranty then there is nothing much even the Ministry can do and Neither will Toyota HQ do anything about it .
Teyseer may be OK for routine Oil change , filter etc - but In know Toyota has a service checklist for a certain Odometer reading . Are there garages in Qatar that can do this type of service . Mine is a fortuner imported from Bahrain . I am nearing 40K on the Odo . I would like to take it to a garage that does the proper job - if any one knowss such a place . rgs
Look , I am really not in the mood for race or background discussions , ok ? I have the right to choose the freakinhg doctor I am going to see . And nobody has absolutely NOTHING to do with it . I just had enough of these endless useless discussions about who is what . If I can get some help with dermatologist any of you has already seen and liked his/her work ... I would appreciate it .
Thanks darude . My response was to what charan was trying to start here .
Go ahead . your choice is your choice . good luck ;-RRB- Ban Spoon Feeding not Me

`` reliable doctor who speaks good english . '' Dr. Jameel at Al Rafa Poly Clinic . 4440499 . Trid & tested with exelent Results . Make a booking 1st to avoid waiting in the long Queue . Ban Spoon Feeding not Me

Check with your embassy for details on this `` application '' Regards !!
If you son is in India -LRB- Chennai -RRB- you should apply there for his passport . You can not apply for a passport for anyone who is not residing in Qatar . You should get a sworn affidavit attested by the Indian Emabssy even for applying the Passport for your son in India .
can i get the sworn affidavit here in Indian Embassy .
yes ... you can get the Sworn affidavit here . Child Birth Certificate & your Marriage Certificate copies to be provided along application apart from your Passport copy .
Sorry , I forgot to mention attaching the copy of the birth certificate with form C1 . Marriage certificate is not necessary . Passport copies of both mother and father are to be attached if both of them are here .

@ jpa , you did n't get my point mate ... why is ANYONE hooked to drugs ? ... there are WAY MORE regular people than celebrities hooked to drugs ... & the reasons for that addiction are multiple ... some of those same reasons apply to your celebrities as
Becoz they are not happy at all !
It is mainly because of the people they associate with . In America we call them `` hangers-on '' or `` yes men '' . They 're the ones that provide these celebs with the drugs . Once you start doing the drugs you become addicted . Think about it , it 's not the celebs going to the ghettos looking for the drugs , it 's the enablers that bring them to the celebs .
its not just now , its been going on through 20-30 years just press are finding things out alot easier with the help of modern day technology .
@ jpa , here 's a reality check mate ... do you smoke cigarettes ? do you drink coffee ? do you drink alcohol ? ... nicotine , caffeine & alcohol are all drugs , they 're just legal , socially acceptable ones ... As for illegal drugs , MILLIONS of people
Thanks for your comments gadarene , but did you answer my question ?
Because sleeping is not an option ... they have to stay awake ...
maybe due to family problems , pressure and being curious about the effects of drugs .
u want to know why im not using drugs ??? because i 'm over confidence . another celebrities they are not confidence so thats why they using drugs to increasing their confidence . . same like one man smoking its means he is not confidence , so he take one cigarret and he burn it then he will think he will be macho man infront of another people . .
They have it all , so they need something new to excite them . .
C'mon rebel , did you flush your brain in the TB ? I am not a celebrity , yet .
thet are lonely ... the person who is rite at the top is ALWAYS lonely . they may have the money the fame the looks but at the end of the day they are lonely souls ... .
The person on top is always lonely ????
jpa ... start takin drugs u will be a celebrity one day : P
Ha.Ha . Ha. , very funny rebel . I 'll do that at the end of yesterday .

Hi Sorry I dont think I gave enough information I am Australian and I believe that the company will sponser me if I was successful for the job but i was wondering if there were a set of requirements like minimum qualifications required to get a visa or something like that ??? I dont want to go through the process to get a job there just to find that I will not be successful in getting a visa ... Thanks
try qualified companies online
having a business visa in applying a job is very difficult . some companies dont hire a person having a business visa because person having a business visa are sponsored by company , that means that company is responsible for you . you did not come here for work but instead you come here for business .

I suggest you brush your pets more often . Wet the brush first then the hairs will stick to the brush .
there are really not special vacuum cleaner available in the market . It is really not advisable to vacuum clean your cat . you have to be very cautious while doing so as you may scare the cat by the noise and sometime by the accidently stuck your cleaner to the cat skin -LRB- it really scary for the pet -RRB- . Instead you brush you pet everyday this will help to clean as well as MASSAGE THE SKIN by increasing the circulation of blood . Brush also help to find out the skin affection if any still you want one -- buy any small low power/speed hand held portable vacuum cleaner . look for the smallest portable one . hope this will help
Thanks Chelsea ...
Thanks Chelsea ...
I know its late after your post but Miele do a vacuum cleaner to remove pet hairs from carpets/sofas etc it is called Miele Cat & Dog -LRB- I have one at home in uk and it is excellent -RRB- I also used to vaccum our dog -LRB- staffi -RRB- and she loved it !!!! Dyson also do one specifically to remove animal hair from surfaces . Do not however know if Miele or Dyson brands available to buy in Qatar but have not really looked .
There are no shops at all in Doha . try New York or London .
thanx for the suggestion . anyone else ?

depend on type visa applied if visit visa will be quick resident visa now days a bit longer 1-2 weeks !
i got the result within three days after visa application - rejected though .
I applied for residence permit , so i am waiting for that approval .
You need to follow-up in immigration , just bring your receipt & coordinate with officer . I think there is documents missing or other issue ...

Now I have the Brake Light -LRB- Flashing -RRB- with ESP & ABS Light Solid On . <br> <br> I have a friend , who knows works & repairs on VW , I am planning to give the car off to him tomorrow , as I am not sure if the problem is with the Alternator , Ignition Coil or some ECU faults . <br> <br> I would like to learn more from you , its good to have friends who have the same car so that it would be benefical to know more .

However , the private sector does depend on nationality . To give you some idea of the possible range for an engineer let me cite an example . Civil engineer indian national working in private sector on a permenant type contract ... expect a salary not exceeding 6000-10000 QAR all inclusive . Civil engineer european national working on oil and gas project , fixed term contract -LRB- 3-4 years -RRB- ... expect $ 500 - $ 700 per day .

What we can be pretty sure of is that it is n't grown in Qatar !
try vegetable market , it 's near ASPIRE u can get best price either than any supermarket / hyper market in Qatar , once in a week i usually go there & get all benefits , not only the price But fresh ,
next to the jarir bookstore in 51 East or whatever Modern Home is now called . On the main floor are some guitars and other instruments . if you go up the dark stairs there are an amazing amount of instruments up there including grand pianos . Do n't go into the main store , go in the side just before the main entrance . : -RRB-
try al badie music instruments , at the back of souq al jaber close to roundabout ...
The `` Yamaha '' store room between Jarir Bookstore & East 51 at the Ramada signal . The `` Continental traders '' at Sharakhaba and also one near the volkswagon roundabout , near 2 Doha City center .
Thanks All I have checked the online website for Badie and they do n't seem to have what I am looking for :-LRB- I guess I 'll give it a go at the modern house ! Thanks again

I think you have to apply for a visa for this maid .
As far as i know , You need to get a NOC letter from your employer , which should state that they have no object to you applying for a maid and also stating your salary , and the nationality of the maid you want to get . Take this to the labour department on C-ring road -LRB- i guess -RRB- , there is an application form that you need to get filled in and submit with the NOC . Will take atleast a week for the approval to come . Once you get the approval , give this to any manpower agency that brings in maids , and they will handle the rest in terms of getting the visa , flights , etc. .
but how much it will cost
Follow this link below . . It was answered by JACKMOHAN -LRB- QLer -RRB- sometime back . . http://www.qatarliving.com/node/75122
I 'd hired the LOCAL NANNY/MAID -LRB- asian -RRB- long time back . . And it cost me QR 2000 for 8hrs in a day and 5days in a week ... No idea about the maids hired from out ...
it is very hard to get an approval for a maid from Ethiopia nowadays ... chose some oter nationality . .
Why not get from Europe and pay accordingly ?
Thanks for all the info . . The one thing that sticks out is the document that shows that both husband and wife work . How is that possible ? The majority of the women I know with nannies/maids do not work . Is that an old requirement ?
MInoush , must be ... Immigration people would be the best to answer you . . I got few links posted on QL sometime back . So it must be the old news ...
Hi Minoush , I can help you with infos , I just finished the procedure for my nany . u can call me
QR 10,000 for fees ?? what is it for and who gets it ?
What for you need a housemaid ? Is so difficult to manage your home and your life ? I am very surprise to see americans end europans , educated people , thinking like that !
Thanks everyone for your help . We found a family who is leaving and we were able to transfer their maid to us . - Marins , do I NEED a maid ? Of course not , I did n't need that Starbucks I had this morning either . But with a 3,000 sq. foot home with wall to wall tile and marble , a full time job , two kids , two cats and a dog - paying someone the equivelent of $ 400 a month is something I do n't have a problem with . Especially if they are able to support their entire extended family with their salary .
Not worth it
Can anyone tell me if there is anywhere to hire Jetskis around Doha . I went to the Intercontinental and drove around the carpark but couldnt find anything .
friday evenings !!
If you past the zig zag tower , cross the bridge and you will see a sign there thats says jet ski for hire .
in Sheraton -LRB- but it is costly -RRB-
there are 2 vets that offer the service . Doha Vets and Qatar Vet Centre Dog walking places are minimil . If you are going to be staying in a compound , you would be able to walk around there . Cornish is another option , but you get hassled by locals who will tell you that its not allowed , but there are no signs , so I generally ignore them and tell them that my dogs are not bothering them , and until there are signs I will keep walking my dogs there . The best place is from the Emiri Diwan side towards the new Islamic museum . Never in the direction of Sheraton , as there are many more people . There are a few beaches , but on weekends too many crowds . Walking through the streets you will be hassled by people driving by , barking at you , or asking how much you will sell your dog for , or generally just harrassing if you are a woman .

get your own customized from Alienware :-RRB- its worth the wait !
I saw a beautiful Alienware laptop in the Virgin store at Landmark last Saturday - I have no idea of the price , I just know I ca n't afford it !
Do you know which alienware it was ? 11 , 15 or 17 inches ?
get it custom made and at half the price ! Go for it !
Well i really wan na go for it , but -LRB- you might not be aware of this -RRB- since late january Intel has recalled all its new Sandy Bridge chipsets which the new Alienware M17x-R3 is equiped with , so production of this model has been stopped ever since , and it 's due to be resumed early march hopefully , so until then my hands are tied !
you will find it in virgin megastore there lot alienware models there . prices are i guess 13000,26000,6000 +
Do n't buy it locally , either go to Dubai and get one there or buy it online and ship it through Aramex . All the Alienwares you 'll find here will be outdated or super expensive . But even if you buy it online , for good specs you 're looking at 2000 - $ 2500 excluding Aramex fees . Buy an MSI instead , they 're fairly cheap and look cool . Or if you 're willing to buy online check Sager . I bought one recently and it 's been working like a charm .
I saw one alienware laptop at virgin megastore in villagio . You may look for some dell resellers .
very rarely seen in Qatar .
saw alot of alienware in Dubai last week !
suggest you build your own specs and order directly from the US . even if you find any Alienware in Qatar the specs would be limited . I have some friends who directly ordered from the US as they did not like the specs available here . It was mere basic and super expensive as always . Best of Luck .
Actually that 's what I had in mind , but my concern was does Dell ship to Qatar ? How exactly did your friends receive their laptops ?
I have been looking for an HP i7 , DV6 3175 past two months , this great country doesnt have them . You get it in any kiosk in Dubai . Gr8 Qatar
Let 's say my customization adds up to 3000 $ , if customs are at 5 % then that would make 150 $ , so why 700 $ ? And ca n't I order directly from Dell ?
I think you are confused , any items imported to Qatar more than 700 USD has around 5 % tax . But obviously before shipping you better call Aramex or DHL and confirm them the actual invoice amount so they can confirm to you . Regarding Dell , i am not sure but on Amazon and Bestbuy you have tons of Alien ware on sale .
Oh ok got it , I misunderstood you the first time , I thought that I have to pay 700 $ of taxes . Thank you very much for your help I really appreciate it . One last question , do you have any idea how much to expect for the shipping ?
I know someone selling his Alienware comp with full accessories ...
i have one ... different specs from the one in virgin villagio ...
Do you have details of the full specs and what condition it 's in ?
Found a link from another site for someone selling an Alienware laptop , http://www.qatarsocial.com/thread-4768-1-2.html . Just thought you may want to check it out .
Thanks a lot for the post ! Only problem is there is no contact number , and i ca n't pm since i only just created an account on that website , so all i did was reply to his post , hope it 's still available and at a good price

Thanks Satheesh ... Thts a Bad experience and poor maths ... I will check that out ... FYI minimum chargeable area for window blinds is 1.5 sq. . M and even if you have a order of 1sq . M still you have to pay for 1.5 .
F u want to install blinds in companies , you can get in touch with Exodus . They do for Hunter Douglous brands . but its bit expensive than the rest .
Innards , I had three windows to be done . So it was 3m2 . Thanks for the info .
I guess then you must have already tried Mamas & Papas -LRB- Villagio -RRB- Mothercare -LRB- CC -RRB- and M&S -LRB- Villagio -RRB-
hi Minoush , I think you probably tried these shops already , ie , mothercare , marks and spencer , BHS , Next . Yup selection is awful , and prices are ouch . Have you tried H&M ? They did have many trousers , price range was 160-250Qar . The other thing to do would be to invest in good pair of basic colour trousers and get your tops stitched .
Have n't tried Mothercare at CC . I hate going there but I may have to ... M&S does not have a Maternity section . I do n't get this ... every local has at least 5 kids , plus every expat seems to be pregnant . Where do they all shop for clothes ?
Mothercare is likely to have but again prices are just too much . I think it would just be better of you have them shipped in . Have you also tried Babyhope ? I think they have a maternity section too ... H&M is also a good try .
I tried H&M and their selection was ok . The only problem were the pants had this new fangled design where the waist is supposed to sit below your waist and it felt like my pants were about to fall down . Just too hip and cool for me . I 'm old and I need mom jeans ! :--RRB- I will try BHS . I 'm used to Target and discount stores . The idea of paying $ 80 - $ 100 for a pair of pants that I will wear for 6 months is impossible . Checked online , shipping from Motherhood Maternity from the States is $ 70 for a ton of clothes . I think I will just do that ... Thanks ladies ! -LRB- and thank you men for holding in your impossibly crude comments that you all love to make on every thread ! -RRB-
try babyshop and Max in City Center . thay have good collection
hi Minoush , you will have to go to Mothercare at CC , because apparently all maternity wear from other MC shops are to shift to MC of CC , if not already there . You need to visit the MC inside Debenhams . The locals wear the abbaya , so a loose gown inside -LRB- the jalabiyas , more like the house maxis -RRB- is not visible to anybody . Among Asian clothes there are many loose tops in style right now , with lycra tights , so again no problems there . Getting T 's is not an issue , as long as you are okay with it hugging you tight all day . The trouser style , is the low bump style right now , and it doesnt really fall off.H & M had the high waist trousers . not sure about baby shop for Maternity clothes , else you may have to try the large clothes section , like Evans , if you are looking for comfy tops . Check Giordano as well , they dont have maternity , but they usually have these loose comfy linen trousers that you can tie under the bump .
LOL Han - you have really been shopping ! ... :D Minoush - Han has given you a very deatiled reply . Now get ready to get yourself to CC ... :-RRB- and Congrats : -RRB-
nomerci : I wore one for the Halloween party : D
Ugh , I wore an abaya while I was pregnant and I thought I was going to die from heat exhaustion !

<P> <STRONG> hello Pink Hippo </STRONG> , the problem with big size clothes is that they slope over the shoulders and just hang limp , like a bedsheet.totally out of shape.pregnant and hormonally charged , the last thing one needs is to not look and feel pretty :--RRB- </P> <P> <STRONG> ishu </STRONG> , trade fairs usually dont keep these clothes , yup you can get those loose jalabiyas for 30 Qars each , very comfy to wear at home.hope they have not increased the prices . </P> <P> <STRONG> IndiaK and ishu </STRONG> , the shops mentioned here are the ones to check out , you wont get more choices than this , unless you decide to shop online or you opt for tailor made clothes.Also each ones style is different , so you really gotto go and hunt for these clothes . </P>
so the shops list is like : Mothercare in debenhams Mamas and Papas H&M NEXT Baby shop or Splash -LRB- big size clothes -RRB- Maxx Ansar Gallery New World Centre Wearhouse Giordano -LRB- for linen drawstring trousers -RRB- Local tailor . Online shops .
Wow !! Thanks everyone !! This is the most help I have ever received on QL !! I will definity keep you all updated as I shop . I need clothes for work , otherwise I would be in t-shirts and yoga pants all day . Plus , I 'm a midwestern gal from the States -LRB- if you catch my drift -RRB- size 10 shoe , 5 ' 8 '' tall , etc. . . cute little petite stuff you find at specialty stores does n't work for me !
my advice , try to shop all u can now , bfore the back pain starts , im 9 months pregnant now and waited to long to shop and has being painfull since here u have to walk so so much to find anything , the shop list is fine , there is nursing bras only in mark and spencer in villagio and in max in cc , the prices are much better in max so its up to u , i personally think that the sell everything to expensive for some cloth u will b using for so little time , wish u good luck with ur shopping and congratz ! :-RRB-
i share the same sentiments with you with my 2 consecutive pregnancies . on my 1st child , i got most of my maternity clothes from my country . i got good pairs of jeans in Mothercare in Debenhams in CC and tops in H&M . on my 2nd , i got everything -LRB- from short/long dress , tops and bottoms -RRB- online and have it shipped thru shop and ship via aramex .
??? For you ? Mabrook ! Mandi
If you want a bargain , try shopping at Mr. Price in Hyatt Plaze . Prices range from 60 QAR - 100 QAR , lower prices compared to the other branded shops .
I agree - Pretty bad - even worse if you want to buy something for work . H+M are fine if you are looking for casual but that is it . BHS does not have a maternity section -LRB- I asked in the one in Landmark -RRB- and mothercare is very expensive - perhaps order over the internet ?
Its near Grand Hamad street , they sell affordable maternity clothes ... also try Ansar Gallery , 4th Floor City Centre ,
`` Male Humor '' ??? . . This is so Racist !! :-LRB-
hi azi , NWC has got nothing ... they used to have full length dresses , now nothing , and you wouldnt feel like picking up anything , or maybe I was there on the wrong day , they were having some crazy promotion going on and it was flooded with shoppers .
I got a few tops from Mother care at villagio.And recently I got few dresses from Max at Barwa Village.The price at Max is pretty reasonable.They have formal trousers too .
Hey Minoush , please keep us updated with your recommendations once you are done shopping . We have been searching for a decent mother care store as well .
Why does it have to be maternity clothes ?? just buy bigger size clothes with elasticated waist . . Or like you said leggings and tee-shirts . . So long as your comfortable , that 's all that matters

My dear , I suggest you not to worry . I also took full driving course from Karwa driving school . While taking the course instructor told me that I may pass in my first attempt . But unfortunately I failed 3 times . I passed only on my 4th attempt . I accept that Karwa driving school is good for learning driving but during test because of several people there will be little bit tension . Regarding your question , Again you have to join either 7day -LRB- 1 chance will be given for test -RRB- or 15day -LRB- 2 to 3 chances will be given for test -RRB- course to reapper the test . Dont worry you will pass when your time comes . Before , I also more worried about driving license . Finally I am driving on roads very safely . Best of luck , Rama
As you had enough patience to undergo 4 Karwa tests I believe paradise has been made mandatory for you .
Analize yourself first . If you can identify the problem , go for another trial . If no , dont waste time .
whenever you ride the vehicle in road , please inform me , i will stay in home on that time , becoz i have fear ... ahahahaha
Deni11 & jayeshpurushothaman ... Do n't even think that you both are superb too ... Instead of encouraging aehs y the hell you both discourage ... Even you both might have appeared many driving exams to get one . . To aehs Do n't ever loose hope 's . . Keep on trying hard , have self confidence and very soon you will have your driving licence on hand . . All the best !! Regards
first of all dont worry . I am taking driving classes in Al Rayah . I passed L and Parking but failed in road due to my silly mistake . And during the test i met people who are attending test 6th time and unfortunately they failed . But some attending test 3rd time have passed . may be God wants u to be perfect.So dont lose heart . Be patient ... I guess u need to pay again and attend another course . Its damn tiring and hectic but we need license right . And my next road test is tomorrow ... I have submitted everything to God ... May i pass ...
u mean ... procedure to fail again ??
Dont worry , you may contact Karwa Driving School Admin office 4588644 or personally visit them and request for Driving assessment.They will give you exact feedback . May be you are afraid of the police officer sitting next to you ...
HAHAHA FORGET ABOUT DRIVING ... NOBODY WANTS DRIVERS LIKE YOU ON OUR ROADS !!! GO TRY AEROPLANE FLYING SCHOOL MAYBE YOU WILL PASS THERE ...
polygamy ? ... maybe , it 's okay if the man is polygamous but not the woman , they should be loyal to their husband only .
Golden rule : `` Dont do to ur wife if you dont want her to do the same thing to you . '' ~ this summarize everything . ^ ^
Why not , forget the birds , take a lesson from the bees !
Personally I would not go for it or allow my husband to do it . However , I would support others rights to it , if it 's what they truly want .
I would say cause we 're living in the year 2009 we need to be more openminded about this stuff . The defintion of marriage is no longer 1 man and 1 woman , and family no longer means 1 husband , 1 wife and 2.5 kids . There are lots of different types of marriages & families , and who are we too judge what 's right and what 's wrong if they are all consenting and happy ?
Yup , and that 's why there should be laws preventing marriage until the age of 18 . In most Western countries there are .
I recommend 2 enough for a women . I mean , one from the front , and one from the back . . `` at any one time '' Polygamy ... yes if you have the strength of a horse to conquer 4 mountains per night .
I see no issue with it as long as they are both consenting .
yes sure ... . . and this ` consenting ' is happening how many percent of the time ?

I know of a sect in india which practiced polyandry marriages ie , all the brothers shared one wife . . It helped them to keep the stability of the family and its assets ! Now bck 2 the topic . . If the heart can accommodate more than one true love and b true to all . . then why not !!!

Competition brings out excellence ...
Polygamy ca n't be wrong . The Great Kings did it .
Having known women involved in polygyny I found it really sad to see the toll it took on their self-esteem and the way their husbands played one off against the other to gain `` top spot '' . I realize that not all polygynous marriages are like that , but all I have known are . Also , outside of religion I have to agree with Gypsy . If it is supposed to be so easy for a woman to accept her mate sleeping with someone else , then men should be able to handle it too . The fact that you know you can not , shows you know it also presents a serious hardship on women -- even if it is `` allowable '' according to religion or law . <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong> I refuse to drink the kool-aid ! </strong> -- <em> PM </em> </p>
before you post about something being allowable in Islam you should really do your research carefully , rather than just take one person 's word for it . The only FIRM requirement is that the man be fair among his wives with regards to time and money spent . And one can not exceed having 4 wives at a time . <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong> I refuse to drink the kool-aid ! </strong> -- <em> PM </em> </p>
Women hates sharing , but men likes it don t you ??? AS a men would you like to share you wife ??!!!
More thoughts on polygamy : ... ... Koran or Quran Noble Verse : Sura 4:3 http://www.submission.org/suras/sura4.htm ... ... . http://www.answering-christianity.com/polygamy.htm
and what we know is that based on the Quran and hadith a Muslim man is allowed to have up to 4 wives providing he can support them equally and divides his time equally . A Muslim woman has the right to choose not to be in a polygynous marriage and she can divorce a husband who chooses this against her wishes . Muslims feel that polygyny is a right granted by Allah and although it may not be advisable to exercise every right , a man who is hell-bent on having more than one wife will do so , using his religious right to do so . I 'm not really sure what you are trying to add here or getting at with these links but believe me , this has been discussed endlessly and I seriously doubt anybody will change their minds . If you are interested in Islam I would suggest you find a good imam near you to talk to . Many of the internet sites can lead you down the wrong path -LRB- submission.org being one of them -RRB- . <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong> I refuse to drink the kool-aid ! </strong> -- <em> PM </em> </p>
but maybe it is different for girls because I did not see sex as a sport and did not like the notion of competing with another woman when my heart was involved . I really ca n't relate to what you are saying here . Perhaps the painful reality of so many polygynous marriages hits too close to home to me . In fact , I would think that Islamic polygyny when practiced properly -LRB- if there is such a thing -RRB- is not supposed to make the women feel in competition with each other . I always thought it places a tremendous burden on men to make sure they are not hurting their wife/wives and make each feel special in her own right -- not compared to the competition . I do n't think most men are able to fulfill that role and I expect to see a lot of `` paralyzed '' men on the Day of Judgment . Moreover , I think it shows a lack of faith that so many take the matter so lightly . It seems to me they are living for earthly pleasure with no concern about accountability . <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong> I refuse to drink the kool-aid ! </strong> -- <em> PM </em> </p>
But only using it as a perspective through which to view American culture . No . It is cruel for a man to make such a competition between his wives . The same cruelty happens between unmarried people through dating , flirting , etc. . It also occurs when someone is flaunting wealth . Whatever intentionally provokes negative feelings that harm a person 's contentment and inner peace is a sort of cruelty . This is the reason for the hijab , and also for the prohibition -LRB- only for men -RRB- of wearing gold or silk . Part of what I wanted to make noticed is how much of contemporary western consumer society is centered around the drive to provoke such feelings - lust , envy , jealousy , etc. in others about one 's self . The `` if you got it , flaunt it '' mentality . That people in the west are now so addicted to this game , is the reason why they react in such horror at the idea of hijab , especially , as if it nullifies any reason for a woman to live if she does not strut her stuff . So I was only trying to see polygamy through the competition lens to make a point about this cultural trend .
I have witnessed jealousy , envy , greed and materialism on a scale I never knew existed in the West . It really was a shock to my system and while I might have found it curious in the beginning , I now see it as so un-Godly it 's hard to even believe you are in the heart of Islam . Maybe you have n't been here that long . It would be interesting to see how you feel after 10 years . <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong> I refuse to drink the kool-aid ! </strong> -- <em> PM </em> </p>
and unique in being THE wealthiest nation in the world . It would not be scientific , to say the least , to take observations of Qatar , and use that as a measuring stick to judge all of Arabs and Muslims , much less Islam . First , as a Muslim you know yourself that there is a wide gap between the ideal of Islam , and the current state of Muslims . And to spend too much breath defending ourselves as we actually are would be a waste except when it is in defense of truth and fairness . I have enough real faults as it is to put up with kafrs making things up . Secondly , yes . If perhaps I think about the small town I grew up in Missouri to the wealth of Doha , then there is certainly a lot more materialism and greed here . But if I were to compare Doha to an equally wealthy place in the U.S. then it would be hard to believe that there is that much more greed here . What there is more of here , but less than in most of the Arab world , I think , is monopolization , the sort of nepotism which kills efficiency , an unfortunate emphasis on irrelevant forms of status -LRB- e.g. family and tribal membership -RRB- over quality work and capability , and extremem disparity . None of these are healthy in Islamic standards . Remember the Prophet warned not to be destroyed by what destroyed those who came before - which was that they were strict in punishing the poor but leniant in letting the rich get away with things . He warned but the Arabs after some time did not listen . So , it did certainly harm them , and is destroying them , at least socially . Still , they are my brothers and I am with them in the same boat ... whether they all acknowledge that or not .
I refuse to believe any 19 - 25 year old lady would volunteer to marry a 45 to 55 years old guy . This would be highly exceptional and not common . Further more it is immoral . Impregnating woman at a young age takes away their possibility of proper education/development and such . one hell of a way to keep females ` low ' .
NO ... one only . one at a time means ... . avoid sleeping with both at a time . Aana free , jaana free , Pakde gaye tho khana free .
I know a couple of women who 've married much older men , and agreed readily to it . They found older men to be more finacially stable and mature . It was n't the way I would have chosen -LRB- obviously -RRB- but it 's what they wanted .
They should not affect the society or community .

Call their offive number & they will transfer you to the customer service rep.there you can ask anything . .
You will get it next week .
If do u have given the contact cellphone number they will text you , be positive

U ll get it in 2 week if ur that lucky in 2 weeks or maximum 3 weeks . . Recently i got my ATM card . . but before that U ll get online bnking detils to ur cell in 2 weeks . . just keep asking bank abt the ATM card after 2 weeks . .
it usually takes max of 2 weeks ... u have to come to the same branch where u open the account and collect the ATM card . best is that , u could have asked them when u can came back to collect the card ... or u could have told them to just send it to you through post .
why do you need ATM card with zero balance on your account ? lol . . what are you going to withdraw ? unless they also aready granted you overdraft . . lol . .

It 's hard to know if QTel is just selling the numbers to companies , or if companies are selling numbers to one another , since my different mobile numbers get different spam .

Howz it going ? ;-RRB- Source : - A study Conducted by FriedUnicorn - Vol I -LRB- September ,1999 -RRB-
To safeguard water in it ... we humans would have depleted its water by drinking otherwise ...
there are so many WHY questions including this one : -RRB-
It is estimated that the oceans formed about 500 million years ago . A lot of the salt entered the oceans during their formative years . As igneous rocks cooled below the oceans , they released a lot of the salt into the oceans . More salt entered the oceans as rock and sediments on the ocean floor dissolved . Still more salt entered the ocean through the erosion of the land . As mountains gradually break down and rains wash over the land , naturally occurring salts of the Earth are washed into the ocean . As water from the ocean evaporates , the salts are left behind , so the ocean gets more salty with time . http://www.strangequestions.com/question/709/Why-is-there-salt-in-the-ocean.html
Because all the sealife creatures do susu in it that 's why it is salty ...
because that way fish tastes good .

Yes , the Lycee Voltaire does indeed take non french passport holders . Has a good reputation and the parents that i know with children there are very happy with the school . Classes tend to be smaller than in the Lycee Francais as well .
Catherine-Anne , je crois qu'ils acceptent les tudiants de toutes nationalits . Je vous reponds en Franais , parce-que vous voulez les inscrire dans une cole Franaise . et pour les non-francophones : I think they accept students of all nationalities .

As far as Bonapart school is concerned it is THE official french school in Qatar . They take french citizen on a priority list , then french speaking passport holders -LRB- there are some agreement between french speaking contries -RRB- then other on a waiting list . Voltaire follows the french cursus , is also sponsored by the french gov. but I am not sure if they hire exclusively french accreditated teachers .
at voltaire school , there is ONLY french `` accreditated '' teachers . no local contract only to teach foreign language and for assistant for kidgarden ... for students , there is 1/3 for qatari 1/3 for french and 1/3 for others . voltaire is also an OFFICIAL french school . 350 students against more than 1000 at bonaparte

what 's the difference between leaving the baby with a nanny who is a stranger or a nursery with a bunch of strangers ? Find a friend with a live-in maid that might `` lend '' you the maid for the evening . At least then you would get a trusted reference .
There are no such ` evenin nursery ' in Doha that i know off . Most nursery close in the afternoon , i think the latest is Busy Bees at 3pm -LRB- I might be wrong , you can check it out to clarify -RRB- .
Dont u have any close friends that you could entrust your baby ? bcos i havent heard of any `` evening nursery '' b4 . even in our country . since most parents come home at night and thats the only time they could spend the time with their children . or at least go to some regular `` daycare centers '' maybe some of them can make special arrangements for you . try it .

if you contact starfish lanes nursery , alot of their teacher assistant available for baby sitting service after school hours .

LP is right 2000 lumens or more is enough for personal use . You can get any brand it depends on the specs , quality it depends on how use it or take care of it .

My Salary Is About 21370 Qr . Is It Enough .
It takes max a weeks times not more than that , if ur lucky within 2 days . Regards
Your salary is morethan enough to get visit visa and you can check in the net within 24 hrs . www.moi.gov.qa just enter the application number and date , print the visa and use it .
Hi , the visa for my parents in law was issued 4 hours after the application ! it was very fast . good luck !
you can get it in 2 to 3 days
Usually it takes a day and half for the visa processing . If you have submitted all the documents to the immigration office you must have a visa application number . You should visit MOI website and enter the visa application number in the visa tracking system you will get the result of your application .
You can wait up to 3 days from the applied date
`` Give the worker his dues , his rights , before his sweat dries '' by the Prophet Muhammed -LRB- PBUH -RRB- should be pasted in all the management offices at HMC . Any sector in HMC which would be left behind would somehow impact on the overall performance . I hope this will be ironed out soon for the benefit of all concerned . =-RRB- __________________________________________________ `` No one is in charge of your happiness except you ''
I absolutely refuse to believe that this is done because of economical crisis . It is all because of the inexperienced and inefficient administration of HMC . Everyday there is some news of buying ultra expensive technology and equipments for HMC , however , they do n't have money to pay their staff . Also , they are constantly pressurising staff to perform better than their best . Well , all of us know the old saying . Pay peanuts and get monkeys to work . HMC will soon turn into a monkey show . And no , nothing is going to change in March 2010 . If there was a real problem , it could be solved . There is no end to fake problems . Are you nuts ? ... . no doubt I am crazy about you !
Is it true that all promotions for expatriates are stopped for next 2 years as part of cost-cutting by the hospital ? A friend of mine said that , thats the reason why they are giving 1 month bonus to deviate the people 's attention from the worst thats yet to come !
never heard of that issue medboy but hopefully not.as far as i know they keep on recruiting nurses and i dont know with other sectors in the hospital.lets wait for 2010 coz they still working this out and inshallah we will get the increment.its hard to hope and expect that far.lets just cross our fingers ...

A big no ... U just waste money on shipping ... And u get very good ones in India .
NOOOOOOOO . only few items I found in Qatar which has good quality and cheap price compared to India are : - 1 . Saffron 2 . Gold -LRB- Price is almost same But quality is good -RRB-
Dude , it is not good idea to buy house hold items from here , since all the branded stuffs easily available in India with better price & warranty .
I did that mistake six years ago . Dealing with clearing agents at customs , and labourer union at customs yard was a nightmare I will never forget.They suck your blood to the last drop .
Not at all recommended - you get every households at your doorsteps . You could carry some of the best chocolates etc. instead ... which will be cheaper than duty free shops there .
Electronic items are subject to guarantee or warranty . What will you do if something goes wrong with the LCD TV , Slit AC , Washing Machine and Cooking Range ? If your are buying them from India most of them are with 2-5 years warranty and some are with 1-2 years guarantee . Some brands are offering extended warranty by paying some extra money . If something goes wrong you can call the shop where you bought it and they will arrange with the Service Centre for the necessary action . I know that some products have International Warranty but it is not as easy as you are buying something locally in India . Further more you will have to spend a lot of money for cargo even if it is by sea .
Good Qaulity branded materials will get in India . . these are made in China ...

Yes , u can add Mr. R 's name in the computer card of A Co. . . It doesnt matter in whose sponsorship he is . . ! But he should have a valid permanant RP !!
read my post . i was talking about Computer card . . not CR !!
I am not sure about Rams comment , When i checked at some typing centers they the info i got was that you should be under same company sponsorship to have signatory in computer card . I know about another situation : If company `` A '' is a branch of a main company under same sponsor and same partners -LRB- where R is one of parter -RRB- and Mr.R 's visa is under the main company , he can be signatory in company A.
humzafar : My name is there in one of the co 's computer card even though i 'm not under that co 's sponsorship -LRB- I 'm working in a govt co. -RRB- I 'm not sure wether the law changed now .
Thank you all for the info provided . It 's now done and the info . is that if the sponsor for `` R '' is a company sponsored by the same Qatari partner , yes , his signature can be added in the comp . card .
Sure ! Aspire Active Women Fitness is best place for women Fitness . .

thank you all for your answers . I have been to ministry of interrior and they told me I need to apply for a tourist visa for them at the airport . At the airport they told me i ca n't do that anymore and sent me back . I know , welcome to Doha and all that . But there must be a way to bring your relatives in for a couple of weeks !!!
Not for Russians ... you should seek a visa via Qatar Embassy .
Its valid for one year ...
ah . . ok i was just concerned . . that by having my residence visa renewed . . my multiple exit visa will be reset or sometin . . so i dont have to worry about that rite ? thanks from the prompt replies guys cheers Handy
Handy - no it wont be RESET ... LOL ... not a computer software mate ... :--RRB- but yeah its valid till May 2011 as u have sd and will be renewed only once it expires ... thats how it is in my company ...
haha . . thanks tinky ! I guess im just being paranoid for my long planned vacation . . dont want anything to prevent that from happening hahaha . . happy Qatar National days guys Handy
it 's valid til expiration date regardless if you renew your rp or not :-RRB- they will not renew it til it expires .
Thanks Plushed ! now im 100 % sure Handy
Multi-Exit is not parallel to your RP 's validity & vice versa . . both have its own expiry date . if your RP expires and you 've left the country thinking that your MEP is still valid , you can not come back , hence , if your MEP expires and your RP is still valid you cant leave . .
pls removed ...
Its myth .
No , that is just a myth . It is perfectly fine to drink milk after eating shrimp or any other kind of seafood .
If everything is linked to the stomach , then why do we eat Vindaloo ??
<P> Hi I wish to have your mail id . </P> <P> I have some questions.thanks </P> <P> Mayr <AÂ href=mailto:mayur2704@rediff.com> mayur2704@rediff.com </A> 66706863 </P> <P> I have migrain and I wish to cure it by ayurvedic way if possible.thanks </P>
<P> milk & meat should be kept far apart ... never mix them or bring them together . If you mix milk & meat it is not kosher . </P>
<p> milk and prawn never heard , but juice or vitamin c + prawn is dangerous . . never eat prawn if you are taking vitamin c. ... and do n't drink juices with vitamin c because it will poisoned you blood cells which will lead to death ... </p>
<p> Ditto !! </p>
<p> Period . </p>
i heard eating pineapple and then drinking milk is dangerous . . it cuts the stomach IT SEAMS ...
- I also heard Fish + Milk should not go together FISH + CURD also why dont u avoid it ?
do n't like prawns at all ...
Reading QL and then eating is dangerous . You are likley to puke
very true jack and very informative ... : - -RRB-
That way people drink cold water after eating meals ... they dont die ... its just abuse of the system ... ts over the years that it affects the body 's metabolism ... ... like if you dont sleep for 24 hrs you wont die ... and many people skip sleep ... it affects them later on . Ayurveda treat the cause not the symptoms ... Modern Medicine treats the symptom eg : If you are having a headache . . Modern Medicine practitioners would give you a tablet to stop the ache ... painkiller ... While Ayurveda Practitioners reach into your body to find the cause ... all in a minute ! Jews I guess too avoid Milk with Meat . its not complete nonsense ... as Ayurveda used for treatment of a lot of disease ... and Ayurveda Doctors scan your body in a minute -LRB- unlike time taking tests modern medicine -RRB- by holding your pulse at 3 points . Snessy the info given to you was half true ... food is related to digestion ... nothing to do with patches . . maybe just to scare children ... lol a well trained stomach can even overcome very high levels of poison ... like Rasputin did ... its also mentioned in the Indian History of Chanakya who used to train himself and his King to overcome poison by taking very tiny levels of poison ... and increasing its dosage accordingly Ayurveda considers the stomach as the route of all diseases ... More : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda

Old wives tales . .
I even cook fish along with yoghurt together in the recipe . Nothing ever happened .
My Mother would serve haddock cooked in milk !!! No ill effects there !!! Got to agree with britexpat ... ... old wives tales .
If you followed that you 'd never eat a Goan fish curry again - stuff and nonsense .
i heard that cooked yogurt doesnot cause any harm . . if u cook fish with yogust while cooking . . bt if u eat yogurt or milk with fish it has some harmful effects . . i am not sure whether it is true or not .
Cooked yoghurt is Ok . But eating fish , with plain yoghurt is supposedly not good for your system . Something to do with the concept of not mixing `` hot '' and `` cold '' foods .
i heard abt drinking milk after eating fish is dangerous . . can drink milk after 2 hours after eating fish not before that . bt about prawns no danger at all
Ayurveda has guidelines about dietary habits ... like : # In the evening avoid heavy foods such as meat , fish , yoghurt , cheese , buttermilk and fromage frais . # Avoid eating between meals . Instead drink hot water , or if necessary eat ripe sweet fruit . # Avoid reheated or stale food . # Most of one 's food should be cooked , as the body can more easily absorb cooked food . Raw food should be eaten only as a side dish -LRB- e. g. salad -RRB- . # Make use of culinary spices . They not only make the food tasty , but support the digestive processes as well . # Include all 6 tastes in each meal : sweet , sour , salty , pungent , bitter , and astringent . The tastes also have their own influence on the subtle inner balance of the physiology . # During meals you may sip liquids such as water , juice or lassi . Do not drink a lot and avoid ice-cold drinks - they dampen down the digestive processes . # Milk should not be drunk with the main meal . It can be taken alone or with a light meal of sweet tasting foods -LRB- e.g. toast , cereals etc -RRB- . Minimise food of other tastes . # Honey should not be heated above body temperature -LRB- 40 degrees C -RRB- and therefore should not be used in cooking or baking . There is also an exhaustive list on the combination of food which is good and bad .
I only know yoghurt and fish should not be eaten together .
Carbohydrate rich food is not combined with acidic food items . eg if you take bread and lemon juice together , it will cause the digestive system to erratically digest both the items . Do n't eat grain , cereal or pulses item with acidic items like citrus fruits , grapes , pineapple etc. . Protein rich food items go well with low-carb food items like rice and vegetable . Vegetables also go well with all types of starchy , carbohydrate rich food items . Fruits should ideally be taken as a separate meal , independent of other regular meals . Milk and meat is bad combination . Never take milk and meat in a single meal . Separate intake of milk and meat by at least four hours . Milk and meat is good for body in several ways . When taken together , it becomes toxic . Many modern food styles fly on the face of this Ayurvedic food combination rule . Milk is also to be taken warm . Cold milk can cause indigestion . Taking milk too hot also is not desirable . Ending the meals with sweet dessert is not allowed in Ayurveda . One needs to end a full-belly meal with some hot and light item like buttermilk . Buttermilk is curd diluted with water and added with a pinch of salt , chilly powder , some curry leaves and a bit of ginger . Many times ginger and curry leaves are avoided from the combination , only due to difficulty in availability . Other factor to keep in mind with Ayurvedic food combination includes the endurance of the digestive system . A strong digestive fire -LRB- pitta -RRB- almost over-rides some of the effects associated with unscientific food combination . Not all are blessed with such a strong digestive fire . And the most important food rule by Ayurveda Do n't burden your digestive system by eating too full . Over-eating is already a strict no-no , Ayurveda suggests you take half-stomach solid food , fill a quarter with water and leave the rest free . This is best for proper digestion .
i am also waiting for the answer now !! gosh is it harmful ??

I dont think I shall ever have the courage to drive in this country . It 's like boys on a racetrack .
Driving is the only entertainment for some people here
is safe here is Qatar . Either in Karwa or in private taxi . Taxi driver -LRB- Karwa o private -RRB- will not start gossip with you unless you talk to them . You are 100 % safe with the driver but not safe in the road .
No taxi there . You should ask one to come and pick you up or call one when you finish !

should be 6 months .
Your passport should be valid for more than 6 months and RP of Qatar should be valid for more than 3 months . . If you are not sure still , check with the UAE embassy . . it would be better ...
Both ur passport and RP must have 6 months validity ... and 100 AED for the payment
moreover I have only Paycard from Commercial Bank Qatar -LRB- our salary disburse from CBQ -RRB-
HSBC or mashreq bank its always beneficial to open an account which that bank in which ur company has an company account too .
thanx for reply but may i need NOC from my Company & can i apply for account opening if i have QR 3500 salary ?
Yes Ofcourse you can ... If you have any pbm in other bank check in Ahli Bank , No need letter from company also . Just need original Passport at the time of opening . 500 Min balance at the time of opening only . Later on you can maintain 0 balance also ... . Hope this help u. ...
YES , you can open at QNB city center , just bring your original passport . no need for NOC , infact I was able to open without an RP . . Visit and try to enquire , they assist you .
yes , sometimes the immigration officer ask for the sponsors oec , depending on his/her mood so better send it to the phils .
The immigration system can identify what particular visa the husband is using and history of your travel , OEC stands for Overseas Employment Certificate meaning for workers under working visa but not for family/visit/business visa .
they would need a copy of your OEC together with marriage certificate for your wife and birth certificate for your child to avail the reduced travel tax otherwise they have to pay the full rate
afaik , oec is for ofw only ... but as denzon said , if you want to avail the discount on travel tax/terminal fee , they need to provide a copy of your oec ... hth ...
toton8791 would you be kind enough to update the thread as to what were required from your family when they left the country ? And did they really need to present an affidavit of support ? Thanks !
First time to Enter in Qatar , no need an OEC ...

hey buddy had to do this myself a month back and here 's what i learned : 1 -RRB- first up , you can normally only sponsor your immediate family or blood relatives on a visit to qatar . what that means is you cant sponsor your friend since he is not related to you . i have heard of some people with special work visas who are able to do so but im guessing you are n't one of them 2 -RRB- now the only option you have is to get a visa through a hotel for your friend . . within this option you have two more options ; you can get a one month tourist visa for a thousand rials but he will have to stay in the hotel which will be expensive . . your second and more feasible option is a business visa through the hotel . . this will however cost you 2000 rials , be valid for three months but the friend can stay with you instead of the hotel . . there 's a few hotels that do this and you could try gulf horizon behind standard chartered bank near the souq waqif/souq asiri area near the corniche . 3 -RRB- now depending on the budget ; if your friend is visiting for long , then the business visa will be expensive but save the expense and hassle of staying in the hotel . but if it 's a short visit then you could inquire about the hotel 's rates for his stay . . so yeah ; i managed to get my buddy into doha because he was ready to pay 2000 for a business visa . . hope you and your buddy can get together and have a great time too . . best of luck buddy : - -RRB-

You want to eat that chilly ? Are you crazy ? I ate some chapati with the chicken curry in which just one chilly was added and I had to take a cup of yogurt with sugar to cool my mouth and stomach .
Cherukkan but which chilly was added ? Yes im sure i really want to eat something too hot , im ready to eat it alone and to cook something with it ! Do you mean by this tatainy mirch ?

Please send an email to contact@qaws.org as we have approved homes waiting for birds to come available for adoption .
We already tried KFC , although Colonel Sanders is a horrible singer . Probably too much grease in his throat or something ... : S Any hotel suggestions ? We are fairly new to the area ...
I do n't have friends to go out with them so I will stay at home alone ike a crazy man :-LRB- <!--break-->
Thanks for all the info . However , what happens if your employer does not follow what was in the contract ? Can I expect any justice given that I am a foreigner .
qatar is not hit hard by the recession unlike its UAE neighbors , my company is doing well here in qatar , so I guess it has something to do with your company .
<i> Is it true that most employers now are delayed in paying out employee 's salaries ? </i> Codswallop ! who told you that ?
no its fake news
Is it true that most employers now are delayed in paying out employee 's salaries ? If that statement was true ... believe me Qatar would stop . There have been some cases but is not the rule of thumb . Regards !!
Just to clarify - Doha Vets -LRB- The Veterinary Surgery -RRB- is behind Barbie Salon near Hamad Hospital and Qatar Veterinary Centre are in the area opposite Villaggio . Both have groomers that do a standard bath and clip but Stephanie is qualified in the specific breed clips . Up to you what you want - I think QVC might have a waiting list though .
stephanie is fantastic and never uses sedation .
Al Jazi Pet Grooming . The lady 's name is Stephanie and I think she 's the ony qualified dog groomer in Qatar ! Her number is 5030523 .
Le Notre is nice
Bateel -LRB- salwa road -RRB- ? Le Notre ? Crepe Away ? And theres alot of stuff open in Villagio during the late morning .
`` Not Applebee 's or Thai Snack . '' Oh well , there goes my suggestions :-LRB- You may want to consider the Royal Istanbul located in West Bay Petrol Station . If you can get a family cubicle in there you should be ok . Good food reasonable price . I like the mixed grill there . And there is a Baskin Robins next door for desert ; -RRB-
Agreeing with Topnotch , it 's a nice place , not too pricey not to cheapy and the one at Salwa Road is quite nice and kind of decorated very picturesque . Enjoy !
well i guess something between 10 and 15 thou a months btw , 30 to 40 sqm , is n't it a bit too small for a chinese resto ? what kind of concept you 'll be having ? xpress or dine in ? I LOVE CHINESE FOOD :-RRB- Yalla !
Thank you phoenix2009,well,10-15thousand is too high price for me , is there any cheaper one?the store i plan to run maybe a chinese grocery store -LRB- xpress -RRB- or some other kind which depends on my personal research about the market there when i get to Doha ... besides , should i pay taxes for the shop every month ? Well , phoenix2009 , you like chinese food ? how you know about chinese food
if you want to intruduce ur chinese food restaurant over here ... then you may need a larger space ... and probably if u open a restaurant ... the rent would be the same as phoenix guessing ...
Hey ~ AlBund , yeah , i just mean Chinese grocery store , you got it . So can you tell me what kind of thing from China might be popular in Doha ? ... how much is the import tax ? Thank you !
Not me . Sorry . I 'm not in Qatar yet either . I 've been frequenting this site to acclimatize myself and to learn what to expect when I do move . Where to shop , what to do , what to drive , where to wine and dine , ahem , I mean dine , where Canadians or Quebecors or the French hang out to date , etc. . I 'll be leaving from Montreal next week -LRB- we just had our first major snowstorm yesterday -RRB- . I hope others can help you with what might be popular there . Keep in mind , though , no pork products in Qatar . All those dim sums will have to be seafood or vegetarian .
FOR ONE BEDROOM IN VILLA THE RANGE BETWEEN 5000 TO 7500 QR PER MONTH THE AGREEMENT FOR ONE YEAR AND THE INCREASMENT WILL BE YEARLY ONLY .
Nothing to worry about finding your choice of accommodation suitable for your budget in Qatar , or scared to secure one with key-money as in your UAE . Just step in to cooperative store or big hyper market , nowadays 100s of advertisements are there looking for people to share it , or rent independantely the apartment for reasonable rate . So you try to keep moving into the cooperative store from location to location so most of the advertisements are found stick on their wall , with contact nos . and you can manage to get one without any difficulty approx . not morethan 4000 / - a best one .
It depends on the location you will be assigned . One-bedroom + hall Villa will cost ranging from QR 4,000.00 to QR 5,000.00 . Rent increase here is freezed for 2 years effective February 15 , 2008 as per Municipal law / notice . You should have a written agreement with you as to be sure that such tenant-landlor relationship / contract is registered at Municipality .
4500 - 7000 RANGE FOR ONE BEDROOM APPARTMENT/VILLA . RENT WILL INCREASE YEARLY ONLY .
why would n't you contact the sponsor and talk to him/her ? Are you sure that the sponsor demans the money ?
I called and spoke to the sponsor . They paid 7000QAR for her 4 years ago . They want that money back !
I put my adverts on every grocery store also here in Qatar Living and check adverts everywhere such as newspapers , grocery advertisement board and also here in QL ! I never approach any agency as my friends used to get their maids from agencies and end up with lots of expenses but if there 's anything goes wrong with the maids they are obligued to replaced them but it will be additional expenses for you . The easiest way for you to do is apply for a maid visa depending on the nationalities you prepared and when visa is approved , then you can start searcing for the right candidate locally who are looking for an employer who can give them visa . Otherwise , there are also free-lancers , who do not need sponsorship but of course you have to give them weekend day off as they are not under your sponsorship , you are less in control of the situation . I had phobia sponsoring maids as they tend to jump off the ship and get into trouble with CID . so in the end I just hire free-lancers ! it may not be cheaper but less headache ! ; -RRB-
7000 should be amortized over 4 years . . :-RRB- To be honest , do n't know what to suggest . . I wouldnt go the way jjh is suggesting ... puting the ads in the grocery stores to get a nanny for your kids is n't the best way to hire a good companion for them . . 6000 is a high price . . on the other hand if you go through the agency , it wo n't be much cheaper . . You just have to come to conclusion that having a nanny is n't cheap . . and pay the fee ...
jjh , there is no such thing in qatar like free-lancer . you are violating the law and encourage other people -LRB- your `` free-lancers '' -RRB- to violate the law ... That 's what must bring you a headache , not sponsoring them . .
your experience is illegal . You can not employ someone who is not under your sponsorship without a legal permission from the authorities .
are you a sri lankan ??? i have visa for sri lankan . . try to get a filipino visa then lets exchange . . give me a call 33237997 . .
Hi . I am South African ... . How will this exchange work ? The person I want to employ will still need the NOC , ?? I want to avoid paying such a vast sum of money ... Please explain !
There are lots of maid looking for a job do n't stick to the one you know ! most sponsor are opportunist ! if they see an opportunity they will demand , although they want to get rid of their maid they want to make money in the last minute ! I release my maids at no cost ! especially those who are troublesome ! Worse comes to worst you will pay for that amount and the maid is a troublesome ! so how can you get your expenses back ? If they are good worker the employer will keep them and will not try to make money in order to release them ! they only demand because they think they have waste a lot of money employing her !
She has been employed with her current sponsor for 4 years and the previous sponsor for 5 years all here in Doha and was in Kuwait before that . I definitely do not think that her current sponsor wasted their money ... She spent an hour with us and played with my son . We were very happy with the way she spoke and conducted herself . If she does not get her NOC then will she have to leave the country ?? Is there any way in which I can avoid paying the 6000 QAR ? Thanks
If you are an employee All you have to do to inform your department or your H.R. to arrange for you all the documents required its an official procedures .

its 4 reyals toll for shaikh Zayed road and if you get cought speeding there , they send the fine to doha and u have to pay . . its money :-RRB-
I had a fine show up from Dubai on my registration number here from the previous owner . It took a long time to show up but that 's when the online system for checking was quite new . it sounds like you intend to speed . hope nobody gets hurt ...
Once it is in the Traffic Police System and is shared with the other govt . agencies like immigration and border control ; If your car is outside of UAE already you will either have to pay the next time you enter with the same car , or if you are still there you will need to pay on exit .
Ya you need to pay the traffic fine according to RTA rules and can be paid through online . you can visit www.rta.ae then you can check the fine as well .
either online or at Traffic Dept. .
Anyone having practical experience of this situation ??
you can buy the salik sticker even after the fine , withen 2 days as I recall and can avoid the fine , they will deduct the normal toll charges only .
What is this Salik Sticker ? please explain ?
in Dubai
How much is that ? seems bit complicated . Fine / toll free / road tax :-LRB- am confused
no idea DO N'T LET FANTASY ROB YOU OF YOUR REAL LIFE BEAUTY
what if you get caught in dubai RADAR with a Qatari car ? A man chases a woman until she catches him . ~ American Proverb .
Sir , he made it through hotel and when i went to book they refuse now when I call one friend of mine in the embassy he told there is no law unless the passport is still valid she can travel .
Just go to Ministry of Labor in Mutazah beside American Hospital , bring the new passport of your friend and the visa copy . First go to reception counter ask for a number and tell about your concern . Wait for your turn , if you meet the lady just ask her to change the passport number in the visa . On the following day you will see the result in the net . I did that also to my daughter just 2 months ago .
Kinder garden , I dont know whether the legal formalities for a non profit organization and profit organization is the same.But usually , if you have to start a company , you need a minimum capital of QAR 200,000 / - which can be withdrawn after the commencement of business.Before the company gets registered , you need to hire a villa/office or what ever.Find a good sponsor as well . Good luck !
NO IDEA BUT I THINK U NEED TO HAVE A GOOD PLACE A QATARI SPONSER AND ALL THE REQUIREMENTS AND A BIG LARGE SUM

Flying With Your Pet FAQAir travel for animals can be tricky and dangerous business , so it is important to know what the law , the airlines , and veterinarians recommend . QuestionsHow do I know if air travel is appropriate for my pet ? What steps should I take prior to a flight to make sure my pet 's trip goes smoothly and safely ? Can my pet travel in the cabin of the airplane , rather than in the cargo hold ? What does the law require me to do if my pet is going to travel in the plane 's cargo hold ? AnswerHow do I know if air travel is appropriate for my pet?Not all pets can or should travel by plane . Air travel is stressful for pets , so you should consider a number of factors before deciding to transport your pet on an airplane , including your pet 's disposition , age , breed and health . Heat or Pregnancy . Animals who are in heat or who are pregnant should not travel by plane . Age . Federal law requires that animals be at least eight weeks old and fully weaned -LRB- meaning weaned for at least five days -RRB- before they travel in the cargo hold of a plane . Although the law does not say so , veterinarians generally recommend against putting elderly pets through the discomfort of air travel . Breed . Pug-nosed animals should never travel in the cargo hold of a plane . This is because of the structure of their faces , which may inhibit their breathing during air travel . If your dog is of one of the breeds listed below , be sure to discuss the issue with your veterinarian and with the airline . Many airlines will not accept pug-nosed animals for air travel . The following dogs are considered to be pug-nosed : American StaffordshireEnglish Toy SpanielDutch PugShih TzuStaffordshire Bull TerrierBrussels GriffinPekineseBoston TerrierEnglish BulldogJapanese Pug , andJapanese Spaniel .
g8 stuff
<p> Thank you Kareena74 for your message . Our dog is shihtzu but we consulted with the vet and he said it 's ok to put her in cargo as long as not when the weather in the ground is too hot or too cold . Are there many shih tzus in Doha ? </p>
<P> Its best if you call a reputable pet relocator in Doha to find out the ins and outs of transporting your animals . </P> <P> Contact Janet at Qatar Pet Relocators on +974-5528Â 6335 or <AÂ href=mailto:contact@qatarpetrelocators.com> contact@qatarpetrelocators.com </A> </P>
looking for instructor .
Hi I was looking around different clubs myself recently and there is a very good instructor in Doha called ` Inigo ' -LRB- Spanish/Basque name -RRB- who has Muay Thai classes at the Ritz Carlton 's gym Tues 7pm or Thurs 7.30 , or the ` The City Intercontinental ' on Wedesday at 8pm . He also runs a kickboxing style class at the Sheridan on Saturday 5pm ? . He 's a decent bloke and he knows his stuff technically . p.s.I 've trained Muay Thai myself for many years with some well known instructors/retired prof Thai fighters -LRB- so know what to look for re a good instructor -RRB- . Inigo runs a good class . Hope it helps , good luck
Im a boxing coach in Qatar . I mean a genuine boxing coach not someone who has done a two day course and sets themselves up as a coach . I met Inigo by chance and we have ended up as friends . He comes to my two weekly classes at the Intercon city and when I 'm away covers them . He is a fantastic coach , one of the best ive worked with . Genuine Muay Thai passion with great teaching . I never let anyone cover my boxing classes except Inigo because he knows boxing very well also . If you want to learn genuine Muay Thai then I would highly recommend him . Also for boxing , swimming and tennis . The guy is a legend !
Hi , I attend Muy Thai a lot . There is a great gym for this next to MegaMart behind the Radisson Blu Hotel . It is Champions Gym . There is a Costa Coffee around the area . Here is the co-ordinates for google maps ... 25.274329 , 51.516586 ... come along ... Cheers
Do they have a website ? Timetable ? Thanks
my friend , am new to doha and got job offer , they are giving me flat there . so before telling anythin i wan na know whats there . please can you breifly tell me.how is the life there.boring or funny enjoyable .
and let me know , is there any restaurants for food .
anwar . . , all i can say is that shamaal area is a bit far and not much development is in place . they are in a way starting to develop the roads so maybe we 'll see some more in the next ten years ;--RRB- silent `` G ''
LOL TB !
For 7000k you ca n't survive here . Think before making further move . Good luck !
this offer kind of OK if they provide u Family Accomodation .
You will spent minimum 3500Qr for your accomodation -LRB- partitioned villa 1BHK ... managable space !!! -RRB- , for 4 people you will have a grocery bill around 1500qr per month . then your childrens studies etc etc. . . if your company will give you family accomodation , transport its ok . . you can think about it !!
That 's hard , For having 2 kids , u need accomodation not less than 3500 Qr/month other than the cost of living , may be that can be accpetable if ur wife found a job this is applicable but not guarnteed
now v r here in qatar in the same condition with 2 kids and same salary , , but no savings , , so please c for any other good chances , , besst of luck , , ,
sharing accomodation : 3000 - 3500 QR Grocery : 1000 - 1500 QR school fees : 1250 - 1750 QR conveyance : 1250 - 1500 QR From the above figures you can decide whether it is worth taking the offer .
No way ... The offer is not good for supporting a family ... One fully furnished 1BHK flat will go not below QAR 5000 / - ... This offer could be still considerable if the company provides you with a family accomodation + QR 7000 . Thats the most expensive thing here ... Negotiate with the company or else wait for better opportunity ...

tinkerbell10 , I AM perfect !
Although I was n't smart enough to seek advice from QLers regarding people here , I was pleasantly surprised at the warmth of the locals . Like Tinkerbell said , there are bound to be a few rotten eggs and that could be from any nationality . .

I am glad you asked this question . . i am sending you a list of QL people who you should not associate with . Best wishes
Spoken like a real Lanki = D
you are perfect that great but you didnt tell perfect from which side
yea and is on top of that LIst you need to have a baseball bat with you all the time so when ever you see him smack his head with it
Legally speaking you are not allowed to live together without being married and if caught can be deported . And you can not get married without a Resident Visa in Doha . So better get married outside first , get a visa and come to Doha . Once married you CAN live together . No problem .
Emily - i just checked with my colleague here and here is what he had to say . He said you can not marry in Qatar without a letter from your father giving you permission to marry and it should be attested in the US . Also you need to have 3 of your OWN witnesses .
It 's cheaper to marry in Las Vegas !
You both need a residency permit to be married in Qatar . You will not get one since you are not employed and can not be sponsored by a fianc . You will have to be married elsewhere - if indeed , that is wise .
Hi Emily , Are you in Yemen now ? Is it because of the hassle of getting married to a foreigner ? I am British and married a Yemeni woman . It was a real headache to get the paperwork done and took a lot of time . I considered leaving Yemen and getting married abroad , too , but it really is not possible . An American I knew in Yemen took his wife -LRB- to be -RRB- to Egypt to get married , but once he got back to Yemen , I heard that the authorities did not deem the marriage legal and he had to go through the whole process . -LRB- This is what I heard , but I can not be 100 % sure . -RRB- I am not sure of your situation , but can totally sympathise with you , as the whole process took me two years to complete . I had my UK paperwork done in 3 months , it was the Yemeni side which took forever ! I do n't think it is possible for you to get married outside of Yemen unless you take your fiancee to the States , where you should be able to get it done . But then again , visas to the US for Yemenis are not so easy to come by . Wish you luck . AQ
You can try the American Embassy in Qatar and do the registration certificate which should be ok and official , check the US Embassy in Doha .
PM me your email address i have application form with me
-LRB- IAM also an Indian -RRB- Dear Sir / Madam First of all i would like to say you that you are a CHUTIYA / PERSON Because : 1 . -RRB- You are here in the Middle east for Carrier-Happiness or to Entertain 3rdClass Politicss . 2 . -RRB- Have you ever hea
My guess is `` At the Embassy '' -LRB- !? -RRB- Regards !!
Dear Trad.cont. , you ca n't be so rude in your response . After all he is also an Indian , it hurts me being a malabari as you said . You need to learn a lot from them to become an Indian first .
Dear Trad . Cont . I feel sorry and shame on you , as an Indian do you know what is democracy and value of right to vote ... Democracy has become even more important in the present scenario.Democracy is said to be the rule of majority and majority should have the authority otherwise there would be serious consequences . When the basic rights of people are denied then they become livid and do n't give respect to the rights of others . That 's why violence is on rise . In democracy people decide who will govern and who will rule . If the democracy is established in its true form and the institutions are strengthened so that every one is accountable for what he had done , the world will be a better place for living . In democracy access to justice is equal for every one and no one can snub the rights of others . Rule of law is insured and hence people respect each other 's rights.In today 's world terrorism and extremism are on rise . Suicide attacks have threatened everyone and the basic reason is injustice . When innocent people are denied of their rights they do not remain innocent any more . When people are not given respect then they do n't care for the respect of others .

Are you asking can a pakistani girl marry an indian or vice versa ? yes they can surely do , however getting visa and settling down in pakistan is much easier if the girl is from pakistan . and you will find it very hard to get the visa process in india if you are taking your pakistani wife to india permanently .
Mr Asharuddin ... Until u Indian guys dont start taking bath regularly , they should not marry u. U guys smell like Fish ... . . yuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkk Did u ever see a pakistani guy interested in Indian girl ? U wil never see bcoz they r realy not interested in them ... . . Better u look for ur own Indian nationality girl , bcoz they deserve u realy

Hi , I am having the same problem coming from Dubai , but I am confussed if the car has to be less than 5 years old . The Qatari web-site claims that if you are taking a car for personel use it needs to be min 3 years old . I have a 2004 model that I want to bring for my move , but I am unsure whether this will be allowed . Any help please ? Thanks .
I do n't agree with all these sorry poknat . ugly women say the beauty is internal ! bullshit there is beautiful and ugly ! -LRB- I 'm mathematician -RRB- ugly women should accept it that 's all and avoid over makeup because that will make here look uglier .
how do you define ugliness or beauty ?
- symetry is a sine qua non quality to be beautifull/harmonious . - color -LRB- white teeth , red lips , eyes , one-color hair ... -RRB- - cleanliness -LRB- hair well done , skin , teeth ... -RRB- - smell - sound -LRB- voice -RRB- - size/ratios -LRB- ches
The standard of beauty is not definite , you define it . It is how you carry yourself in the face of all the people , situation surrounding you . For you , how do you define beauty ? Everyone here has a word to say about beauty and if that is there personal view about the topic than so be it ... ^ ^
Beauty is a very big word that most people do not understand and easily mis-interprete most times . Have you ever wondered why some find tall ladies pretty and others think petite ladies make the world go round ? and why do some like light skin tone and others will go anywhere around the world just to have a darker skin tone ?? or why do some people simply just get bored of the beauty queen the married recently ? its because , BEAUTY IS A COMBINATION OF DESIRABLE PHYSICAL , MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL QUALITIES . PHYSICAL beauty is a combination of qualities like shape of body , color -LRB- light or dark tone of skin , hair , eyes not necesarily ethnic background -RRB- and form so that it causes a pleasing effect on the beholders senses . The right mix of this differs from person to person . Its better known as pretty in females and handsome in males or good looking in general . MORAL beauty is influenced by culture and traditions -LRB- also religion -RRB- of the locality . and moral beauty qualities includes modesty , comportment , respect , charisma , cleanliness and others . INTELLECTUAL beauty is wisdom or practical use of knowledge . We can see that , Though it is not wrong , most people judge beauty based on the physical only , but this is just a part of beauty called `` looks '' and is only skin - deep , not the total beauty . A true and total beauty is a person that has a reasonable amount of the physical , moral and intellectual beauty . This is the standard used for most beauty pageants , but offcourse , the moral and intellectual part is usually played low . Your Grandma can be a moral and intellectual beauty but not a looker ! ... atleast not anymore . ;-RRB- . What might be beautiful to one is not to the other since everyone has a different standard of measure , but can agree on a general level . On a final note , since physical beauty can tarnish with time , timelesss beauty can be said to be the inner moral and intellectual beauty of any person . Everyone can be beautiful , ... without surgery . Think about it .
defines it all
Being elegant is beauty.God 's precious gift to one . .

`` Women are not ugly : the drinks are not enough ! '' -LRB- Romanian saying . . -RRB-
beauty is in the eyes of `` looker '' not in the `` looked '' . But we may agree that at a certain level there 's a basis on which all humans agree . it 's all about proportions . if you take the composition of a human face . each element alone is ugly . and as placed together they may be good looking or ugly . and because we always look to human faces our brain can rapidly differentiate very small details and amplify these in the scale of beauty . look at black people of African tribes -LRB- no offenses -RRB- they may be regarded by a blonde as all ugly . but in fact they developed a differentiating criteria and new scale of beauty . let 's look at you cat . cats see human faces the same . because we also see cats all the same . But if you have 20 cats at home you can see some differentiators . it 's all about the eye of the `` looker ''
When you look someone male or female you should feel the kindness and peace . A man is modest when he admire his wife always and keeping himself away from other women and a Wife is modest when she show her beauty only to her husband and men and women both are modest when they find the happiness through making her husband or his Wife happy . Making a life as the wish of GOD make them modest . As a Muslim I am so proud to say that I see my Wife as the most beautiful girl in the world . That makes me to stay away from all other women .

Well said :O -RRB- `` I wonder how some people look so beautiful/handsome and some do n't ! '' Because , beauty is subjective . . I could tell you about my Cuban Shotputter , but there are not enough pages on the screen : o -LRB-
beauty is in the eyes of the beholder . . Its not about physical but its about the heart and the attitude , the way dealing with other people showing kindness , that is the beauty ...
Nature has created forms , shapes , and traits that attract opposite genders . Unfortunately societies have surpressed these natural feelings all the way through customs , traditions , and religions . Hence , many people growing up run into problems . The Playboy beauty is only ` beautiful ' for a limited class of people .
Beauty lies in the hands of the beer holder
A beautiful heart makes a person beautiful however UGLY they may seem physically . A BLACK and ugly heart will make even the most beautiful person look UGLY ...

Hi dohamarketingdoha , I was looking for someone who can provide business visa . Please help me in giving a business visa for my bro . mail me at masti636@gmail.com Will be waiting for your reply . Regards , Mustafa
if you want to work here i suggest business visa , but you want to visit try tourist visa
Thank you for your prompt reply . Yes the main purpose is job searching . How can I apply for either visa ? Thank you .
doha186 , you can not suggest a business visa . Business visa is issued by the company which wants to hire a short term employee or to bring to Qatar some people related to their business , such as consultants , partners , etc. saleemkh , if you do n't have any business related matter in qatar , you can not come on business visa . For job hunting come on the tourist visa , or look for the job through the internet .
i can give you a 3 months business visa but you must leave Qatar after that as we dont provide NOC .
Thank you guys for your replies . Do I need a sponsor for Tourist visa ? How can I apply ? Can I do via Qatar Airways ? Thank you .
dohamarketingdoha , to buy business visas is illegal . You can only `` give '' visa to someone who is working for your company . I am wondering if your top management is aware of your illegal activities .
whenever you need a change of RP you need NOC .
No . There is no obligation for a private company to give you an NOC for any potential future employer .

My favourite english radio stations in Qatar : 1 . Studio one FM -LRB- KSA -RRB- 2 . Radio 2 -LRB- UAE -RRB- 3 . Radio Bahrain Ditto !
My favourite english radio stations in Qatar : 1 . Studio one FM -LRB- KSA -RRB- 91.4 or 94.1 -LRB- ca n't remember which ? -RRB- 2 . Radio 2 -LRB- UAE -RRB- 106.0 3 . Radio Bahrain 96.5 These are for the English language stations which you can receive here All a bit ` weather-dependent ' - unfortunately - but somewhat miraculous that they work at all . Also if all else fails try 101.7 for the sound feed from Al Jazeera English TV news channel . Makes any prog with sub-titles a bit tricky though . :--RRB-
Listening to QBS makes a dead person alive from the grave and again dead ... : -RRB-
There was a day when they were playing some ass-boring music and then this british guy , with a strange voice -LRB- Bernie -RRB- said he got tired of getting SMS criticizing his musical choices , and that he did not care and therefore he would continue playing the same ole-same ole . That was the day when I stopped listening to this GRAP !
On 104.8 MHz is also sometimes receivable . But all the long distance FM channels seem to have gone in the last few days with the arrival of Autumn ? Must be a heat/humidity thing that allows us to receive them in Summer .
that 's what was said on that radio station when one of the announcer -LRB- forgot his name -RRB- negated that him and Bernie sounded alike .
If Dubai and Bahrain FM radio stations are received clearly in Qatar then who would listen to 97.5 ?
Just like the local newspapers you would probably get very little information worth listening to on this station . Perhaps try tuning to the French service of QBS
its there in the arabic service .
Why would they report traffic news ? It 's the same reason why weather reporting is not big business . The report would be -- heavy congestion at every round about , multiple accents , crazy drivers in little pick-ups , aggressive drivers in LCs and large trucks generally being moronic . In other words , it 's lethal out there so drive something large and pray a lot .
The truth is simple but seldom ever seen . QBS is n't a ` News Channel ' ! It 's an amateur radio station and serves as an alibi . Do n't expect anything and you 'll be fine .
Are you a fan of Star Strek ?
I am no `` fan '' of anything , tcom ! `` Fan '' comes from `` fanatic '' , you know ?
I am talking about your ID
Wait and only apply to Doha English Speaking School . If they get accepted then leave the UK . This school is only British school which follow the actual British curriculum and is monitored by the British educational council . All the rest of the British school claim they `` follow '' the British curriculum . Who is there to monitor the school ? If you PAY for a private company to accredit the school , they will come out and give you accreditation . You will find out that your child will be a year behind because majority of the schools do n't have the textbooks for each subject in the class . Nor do they have a curriculum without textbooks or manuals . Sadly , the teachers have to deal with the parents as to why their child is behind because the Principal will pond you over to the teacher for any complaints .
DESS although the best has LONGGGGG waiting list and is until primary . For me , no harm putting them into the waiting list & pray that you will get a place . To me there are other good ones like Doha College , Parkhouse , Sherbourne & Doha British School which you can consider . Due to personal preference , I have seen parents transferring their kids within these few schools too . Alternatively you let your husband settled here first . . find a school before you guys come over . All schools require entrance exam before they are accepted . So whenever a place becomes available , do prepare to fly them immediately .
Its not easy to find school seat available in Doha so I strongly suggested to apply now . Newton British School and Montessori British School are the best following British Curriculum and the best location -LRB- Al Waab/Al Azizya -RRB- for western people to live . Good luck Angelo
Any place you can get is good . Apply to at least 6 schools and keep your fingers crossed . it might take up to 2 years
To me , whether you are coming with your husband a not , you have to start applying now & wait for schools to come back to you with a place . As of now , I can say ALL schools Brit or non Brit are on waiting list mainly due to 2 reasons 1 . Influx of new families coming to Doha to work while the existing ones are still here . 2 . Existing people are transferring schools to their desired schools or so called better schools . So for schools like Doha College & DESS would have super long list . Heard that there are people waited for 2 years to get into DESS . Nevertheless , do n't get upset over this as I believe they picked the names by random & also by academic results . So all u need to do is first to submit yr apps & pray that you get picked for an entrance exam . And do n't worry about the entrance exam . It 's very easy and nothing that ordinary kids can not do.Another thing that you need to do is to call them up periodically to check for spaces available after you have submitted them . Last but not least , if you really have to come here with your hb , take whichever school that can offer you place & wait for your desired on to be available . Tat 's what everyone did here in Doha actually .
Thank you Bral1960 !
Thank You , Minie ... That was a very useful post ... I was worried about the entrance exam , my boys are straight A student 's at thier current school , but i did n't know what the Doha Schools would expect of them ? I 'm hoping that the exam 's are sat in a nice environment and the children do n't feel any pressure , i want the whole move to Qatar to be positive , so fingers crossed , Sarah xxx
Hi Redline , my husband got a job for QA as well and we are moving to Doha in May ! We are on the same boat !!!! The best think to do is to apply NOW for all the schools.Newton British School might have a place for your children ... just start with any school you can find and then wait for your desired school ! Good luck !!!!
Your husband can apply for the kids while you and them wait in the UK . If there is no movement on the waiting list then obviously you do n't want to give up their places in the UK . To be fair it is probably harder to get your kids into a good public school in the Uk than DESS . People are coming and going from Qatar as there is only so much time you can spend here . The quality of DESS is OK , but the teachers do tend to concentrate on the better kids . There is also considerable bias and confidentially can also be breached . Codes of conduct and ethics are more relaxed here .
Thanks for that , we will see how thing 's shape up ...
My husband also works for Qatar Airways . Now is an excellent time to apply for schools here as they are sorting places for Sept 2012 . I am a teacher and it was a worry trying to get our daughter into a school . We arrived at the wrong time of year and it took a while to get her into a school so I had to home teach for a while . However , this time last year we got our daughter into Doha College . She has come on in leaps and bounds and we are thrilled with the school . The school has recently been inspected and did extremely well . They use the British Curriculum so the transition from UK to Doha College was very easy ! Your children will need to sit an assessment but it 's nothing to worry about . You will also need previous school reports from their current UK school . Other schools that we were impressed with were DESS and Sherbourne . Hope that helps ! Good luck ! : -RRB-
I disagree with Expatemily -LRB- I am a friend in real life with her -RRB- Park House is a great school . Also loads of Qatar Airway people . I have 3 kids in the school . Other good schools -LRB- based on my dealings with the schools and friends comments -RRB- are Doha -LRB- Montisori -RRB- British School ; Doha Collage , Doha English Speaking School . These four schools are also `` reasonably '' priced . The American schools are crazy expensive . I suggest applying to all of those schools now -LRB- as in today ! -RRB- . Places often open up over the summer and Park House requires a deposit on next year from current students in May for September so you could still easily get places . Having 3 children is an advantage because one one gets a place it tends to bounce the others up on the waiting list .
Everytime I log on here and see comments about schools I chuckle at the amount of best schools that are listed . To date I believe there might be about 6 `` best '' schools in doha , based on what , usually perception based on how well a particular child is doing at that school at that moment . It seems to me that if a child is struggling or not doing particulalry well then first thing to do is blame the school `` it must be the school '' . A well motivated pupil will thrive in most environments and from what I have come across so far most of the schools are okay , as long as they are not for profit ... we are never going to replicate a top british school but why would we want to as one of the benefits here is the multi culturalism . Of course places are tight but I dont think people should stress as much about the schools . I have a child of 13 who will either go to DBS or DC but personally I would have him in ASD -LRB- no chance -RRB- but not because the rest are rubbish just because I personally got a better feeling about the ethos of the school .
Everybody reckons their school is the BEST ! My kids -LRB- Year 7 & Year 5 -RRB- go to DBSM and I have no knowledge of such large class sizes nor any deviation from the British curriculum - a friend of mine teaches there and she is clear that what they teach is the same as home ? They kids recieved excellent text books and stuff . There are horror stories about most of the schools mentioned above -LRB- prob including DBSM ! -RRB- and as many `` Best '' schol tags for the same schools - it is down to personal preference and experience .
Thank You everyone for your quick reply 's , i 'm going to start applications today to all the schools and hope for the best XXX
Hi , my kids go to DBS as well , year 2 , 3 and 5 none of the classes are overcrowded all have around 24 per class - they do follow the British Corriculem and would go as far to say they are a year ahead of the kids in England .
Best of luck with you school applications , I have heard all the British Schools are full even for September so would recommend not coming out until you have places for all of them at the same school .
Not strictly true , they are opening a new class in each year , we have got a place in yr three for our daughter and the class size will be 22
Is the above School at your talking about Cedars ? Sarah x
Check out Loydence Academy , English curriculum to a high standard . New campus opened September 2011 at Al Aziziyah , very small class sizes but growing weekly .
Becareful if you have gifted children , places like Park House , Newton etc are not able to provide any additional support and your child will not make any progress
Be careful if you have children , simonsmithy , because your child will not have much support and not make any progress without dedicated teachers and a school with good facilities . The truly gifted children in Doha are those who have been given the gift of a place at a decent school . Can you please tell me the name of a school in Doha that does not have entrance tests ? And why do they have entrance tests , simonsmithy ? All schools have entrance tests in order to keep out children with special educational needs . In this respect , Park House is no better or worse than any other school .
I know kids who have got into Dess without entrance tests - just reports . Same for sherborne , PHES , newton etc . All based on UK reports and no tests
You are mistaken , simonsmithy . Most children who are trying to gain a place at most schools in Doha have to sit some sort of entrance test . I know the lady who arranges the tests at one of the Newton schools , so I know that , as usual , you have got your facts wrong . Perhaps some children who do come from `` prominent '' schools in the UK might not have to be put through a test , but these are exceptions rather than the rule .
I think it 's best not to accept anything but your preferred school , the transition from the childs home country school is hard enough but to have to then go and uproot them again after they 've made friends and settled in is n't really fair on the child . Please do n't despair with my comments just trying to be realistic , it 's your decision at the end of the day . Doha is great by the way and you and your family will love it once you 're all out here and settled .
Thank you for your comments ... . DC and DESS are my two favourite School 's and i have applied for both ... I have no idea if i have any chance at all at getting them in any time soon ???? Sarah XXX
PS Michelle , i totally agree with only putting my children into one school and not changing them to my preferred Choice when a place become available . My Children will already have to leave all thier friends behind in the UK and i do n't want to make them do it again once in Doha . Sarah XXX
Thanks Simon , You have to try though , maybe more chance with Sherbourne ? Sarah
I have registered for Park house this year and they told me that they received over 600 applications in 2 days . However , I just applied online anyhow . They came back to me & told me that my kids are unlikely to be selected due to the long wait list . Anyhow you can try . Prob you have better luck . You only change school if you are not happy with the school for whatever the reason is .
As a possible short term solution you could try Cedars . We had our child enrolled there for a couple of terms whilst we were on a waiting list for another school . As an Australian family we had additional problems because our academic year does n't match up with the UK system . The standard of teaching is excellent -LRB- almost all teachers are British -RRB- and the class sizes are small . To be honest , if if was n't for the fact that their building is too small to offer PE etc. we would have left our child enrolled there . Anyway , just a thought . I know from experience how frustrating the whole schooling situation is here . Good luck .
I could n't agree with you more . How can you send your child to a school without seeing it ?! x
My children are enrolled in Middle East International School , American curriculm . My husband did all the leg work while I was in Canada . New campus in Abu Hammour area . We decided on this school as it 's the closest to the Canadian curriculm . I 'm crossing my fingers and pray to God it 's a great school for my children .

Now that DC have a new primary there will be no spaces for DESS kids at DC
I am sorry , Tracy.C.Marriott , but I do not understand . Are you suggesting that Newton International Schools - there are in fact three schools , not one - are British schools and that they are not in fact `` international '' schools ? Or that they only employ British teachers ? Or that they follow the English National Curriculum , even though Arabic and Islamic Studies are not actually part of the English National Curriculum ? Or maybe that all of the students are British ? What exactly are you saying ?
not of the children though !
wow ! how to turn a helpfull answer into something it is ` ant . well done All I was trying to say is I know the headmaster , the school has 500 places , I believe it to follow the British curriculum . I gave the web address so anyone wishing to know more , could look .
There are 4 schools now
Only the so-called community schools do not have the Arabic requirements . These include DESS , Doha College and the American school -LRB- and maybe others -RRB- . Other private schools are subject to the SEC rules on this .
Redline944 There is a brand new international school that most people do n't yet know about - Compass International School , Al Khor . It opened this past January . It follows the British curriculum and the IPC . The classes are capped at 22 students . If you live at the Pearl , it is an easy 25 minute drive up to Al Khor , and the school offers bus service from the Pearl and Zig Zag towers . I can say quite truthfully that the British curriculum is followed with fidelity because I am one of the teachers there . I love it , and so do the other staff and the students . The teachers there live to teach , and the students are engaged and thriving . I do n't mean to sound sales-y but I am quite passionate about our little slice of Qatar ! Feel free to ask me any questions . www.cisalkhor.com
My husband and I are moving to Doha very shortly . We are waiting for our visas to be issued and are hoping to come over mid-October . We have 3 children , they will be going into years 5 , 4 and 2 in September here in the UK . A lot of people have suggested putting their names down for schools from now however we are a bit confused as to whether this is possible given that we do not have our visas , residence permits etc as yet . Do the schools accept applications without the kids actually being resident in Doha ? What do you advise ? We are very keen on moving as a family , however , although we 're not too fussy , from previous experience I am not keen on home-schooling : - -RRB-
We went through a similar experience recently where we had to choose a school for our son . We read many stories and received advice ; all very confusing . So we visited the schools that had availability and chose the one that we felt was most suitable after interviewing the headmaster . I think it is beneficial to have your children with you in Doha when school-hunting . The entrance tests will need to be undertaken if there is a place available . My son is enrolled at Newton International Lagoon -LRB- he is 15 yrs old -RRB- and we are looking forward to the opportunity he has and face it with a positive attitude . I trust you find a school that has availability and that resonates with you and your family .

Risk is a good trainer . pm him
How can I contact him , any email address for him , thanks
One way to find a good trainer might be to ask at your veterinarian when you take the puppy in for its checkup and first vaccination and worming
you can check at QVC they have dogs training classes available , check their contact at their web site www.qvc.com
If u are still looking for one feel free to contact me on 66667575 when ever you are free so we could discuss the issue over phone . I am a dog trainer from US .

go for kia cerato
Out of these , I will choose Nissan Tiida
cruize if you wont use the car for many years . . if you will go for tida . .
either toyota or nissan . go for toyota corolla or tida ... dont go for other brands , initial cost is less but the maintenance is very expensive
Chevy cruze . Without doubt , it is made in Korea and maintenance is cheap
tida
I would go for the Nissan
to tell you what i observed . . if you would ask filipino 's most would go for cruise coz of the looks . . if you observe further most filipino 's drive mazda 3 , honda civic and lancer ex gt becoz of its sporty looks . . but not considering the looks tida would be the best of the two youve mentioned . . try to consider mazda . . not a top brand but it can compete with looks , price and performance . .
ok thanks guys and tigabaguio :-RRB- i will think about tiida then : -RRB-
O General is best compny 1.5 ton ac is good . qr around 1400 / -
Toshiba , but expensive better get a 2.0 tons ac for your room .
Go for Split . . All reputed companies are fairly similar in terms of performance . . Need to know the dimensions of the place to tell you the exact ac you need .
LG/gold /
Sure general is the best AC could be operated in the gulf
still closed ... hopefully they will reopen soon tho . . its one of my favorite places !!!
Closed by Municipalty -LRB- Baladia -RRB- for contravening with the health standards . It 's a shame for this excellent restaurant . I assume they must 've have found something seriously dangerous on our health to close it .
it is true that TCR is closed . . but they have opened in diferent location . . u just go further 100 mtrs . . on th eright side u will find the same TCR ... happy . . yeah >> ?
Now it 's closed for renovation , but they 've opened Turkey Center just a few doors down . Have tried the shish tawook a couple of times . Not quite as juicy as before , maybe they 're still working out the new oven ?
I visited yesterday the temporary Restaurant , they advised that the renowated main restaurant will be opened in 4 days .

<strong> Hi there ! My name is Dana , and I am from Bahrain . I read this post and followed the advice of jamesarl & bmw528 and ordered some acai berry to Doha over the internet . I just wanted to share my experience with you . I ordered 5 bottles of acai berry health supplement , and it took 6 days to arrive at my office . from : www.acaiberryboutique.com I took the supplements to my physician and doctor , she also uses the same supplement -LRB- acai berry pure -RRB- for her health . She had never ordered online , instead she used to buy them when she was in the US or have friends bring them over . She compared the stuff I got from the acai berry boutique -LRB- the online store -RRB- to the stuff she got in stores in the States , and she said the quality was MUCH better from the online store . We both read a lot of blogs and articles before buying online . There are lots of ways to check quality -LRB- color , taste , feel , texture , density etc -RRB- and my doctor said the online stuff was significantly better . She is also recommending it to her patients now for things like joint pain , inflammation , digestive system , and healthier body shape . I would also recommend you buy the product online , because it is higher quality than what you can get in stores here , and in most places in the States . They ship very quickly for a site located in America , and the prices are very good for such a supplement . Thank you jameearl and bmw528 for your recommendation . www.acaiberryboutique.com was an excellent place to buy acai berry ! <strong>
Hi there , i ordered acai berry on acai berry boutique but until now it does not arrived yet ... how many days does usually it arrives when you order ? i ordered that almost a week ago ...
http://www.officialwire.com/main.php?action=posted_news&rid=148624 Acai Berry Scam : Dark Side Of Online Marketing Consumers losing money not weight , the truth about acai berries is now exposed for the masses Acai berry has been known to have countless health benefits but with no relevant data to support the fact . Despite the lack of data , modern day people have embraced acai berries as their next best thing to lose weight and gain a healthy body , skin and digestive system . But the truth is that acai berry benefits are overrated . Acai palm , derived from the Euterpe genre of palm cultured in the Brazilian rain forests is known to have antioxidant properties , which is true . But the antioxidants need to be as good for health as it is presented to the common man . Also , as acai berry is not directly consumed by human beings , more than half the beneficial properties of the fruit go in vain . After processing and converting the berries into supplements , it is presented in the form of dietary pills , concentrated juices , beverages , instant drinks , smoothies , yoghurts or is eaten whole as a fruit . When taken as a whole fruit , the benefits are genuine , but not otherwise . Acai berry scam has been exposed today because of the scientific data that reveals that there has not been any research or investigation about the claimed benefits of the fruit . Producers of acai supplements have presented unproven claims and declarations to people about the health benefits of the fruit and its antioxidant properties , but these are all unsubstantial claims . The truth is that acai berries have only very negligible amounts of antioxidant , which is quite less than what you can find in other types of berries and fruits . It needs to be brought to light that there are no such benefits of acai berries that scientists could have pointed out . Acai berry and products made from the same have not earned an approval from the FDA , and the potency of these products is questionable . There have been many talk shows and conferences regarding the false claims of acai berry as a weight loss supplement , yet people are simply reluctant to acknowledge the fact that acai berries are simply not acceptable according to medical and scientific terms . Many consumers of acai products have actually suffered from health complication in the recent past . It should be considered as awareness for the masses , as acai berry products have almost flooded the market today . Despite the warnings and acai berry scams revealed on the internet every other day , still there seems to be a lack of communication that needs to be bridged . Internet has had a great influence in marketing acai berry products . However , it has also contributed in revealing the acai berry scams , which people have often overlooked . As companies come up with potential free trail offers , customers fall prey to these lucrative offers and accept them . In the quest to try out these products , they often end up endangering their health . Acai berries does not have any miraculous properties ; it is just like any other fruit that has not been researched or scientifically tested to have any medicinal properties . The only presence of antioxidants does not make it a weight loss product as well . Hence , prevention is advised . For further information on this , you can see : http://www.acaiberry-info.com/acaiberry_scams.htm
I got my acai berry in 5 business days from this online site - acai berry boutique . I definitely recommend it to others wanting this supplement in Qatar . The stuff you get at supermarkets and GNC is junk here compared to this online site . Even take a look at the content , you will see its only less than 10 % , but online site has PURE acai berry capsules , with 100 % extract concentration . Results come much faster . I recommend it to others .
<b> <strong> the best place to buy Acai Berry is online ! check out www.AcaiBerryBoutique.com -LRB- The Acai Berry Boutique -RRB- It is a great place to buy acai berry , they sell 100 % pure , natural and organic acaiberry products , and they ship to Qatar . I have used them several times before for ordering to Doha , and would highly recommend them to all ... hope it works for you , enjoy ! <strong> <b>

hello . . if you have QNB account , you can apply for Master E card.QNB offers its customers a secure way to shop online . The MasterCard E-Card has been specifically designed to allow only Internet transactions . It can not be used at ATMs and POS terminals at shops . QNB MasterCard E-Card is issued as supplementary card to the main credit card with a lower credit limit . enjoy your online shopping once you get this . .
In CBQ they are offering virtual card .
Some banks also offer a pre-paid internet shopping card . Functions more like a debit card than a credit card , becuase you purchase the card in a set amount and then spend it via internet purchases , rather than having a credit limit . I know for sure that Doha Bank did this last year , and I have heard that other banks do as well . At Doha Bank you needed to be an account holder . Hope this help .
go for doha bank inernet card i m using it.its good and secure
Credit Cards should not be used online to make purchases . Prepaid Internet cards in Qatar are issued to only those people who already have a Credit Card even if you have an account with the bank . Why it should be linked to `` Credit '' when the payment is `` prepaid '' ? Beats me .

I do n't want to be harsh but parent are equally responsible for inculcating proper educational values in a child . Parent should be more involved with the education of the child even if they are busy . Qatar is a place where you can not rely completely on the teaching staff and tutoring the child is quite expensive . Unless the child is exceptionally talented he/she needs parental guidance .
Sorry to hear about the result of your children ; ... Which exams you 're talking about ? Federal Board Exams are proceeding these days ... but you 're mentioning the results . Are your children studying in the other stream the Cambridge System ?
What do you mean by `` did n't get good results '' ? Can you tell us how bad was the performance ?
I think your intention is to criticize the lady principal . 9th and 10th stander Exam still not over and 11th -12 th exams will start on 4th next month , what you mean by board exam . In BFPS results are pathetic . Which board announces result when exam is yet to start ?
I agree with MOM_ME here ... No school is either good or bad and yes there may be good and bad teachers given that in this part of the world its very diff to get qualified and experienced teachers as they are paid peanuts . BUT that being said we as parents are also in many ways responsible for the education of our children . Just studying the lessons in School arent enough . when they come home see that they revise their work everyday and do their home work on their own . Guide them properly and give them good books to read to expand their knowledge . A teacher only GUIDES the child . and if the teacher has not explaind the chapter well or you feel the child needs more then try to do the same at home or hire a tutor to help your child . That being said - every child has their limitations . We shudnt expect our children to perfom miracles nor bring in 100 % results all the time . Just encourage your child to do better than the last time every time he sits for an exam and try NOT to create any PANIC or TENSION . every exam shud be approached with a cool head and DONT encourage your child to memorize . Teach them to UNDERSTAND the subject and study . That not only creates an interest but retention power is more .
Sorry , I thought the ` std ' in the OP meant something else .
<P> Hi Rising Stars Kindergarten is excellent ! I think you have beeen misinformed by your friend regarding the children watching tv all day . Children who arrive early before classes commence are supervised in the tv room . At the end of the day children go to the tv room if they have not been picked up on time ! Parents appreciate this service as there is no extra charge.You say you went to check in the holidays and every class has a tv in it . I do n't know which kindergarten you visited but it certainly was not Rising Stars . The only tv is in the tv room . During the holidays a summer camp was in progress ! I invite you to visit Rising Stars anytime then please post a valid and truthful comment . </P>
<p> Really surprised to hear this comment , my Son goes to RSK and he has really excelled since we enrolled him there . They have only one TV room like any other kindergarten , So I do not understand where `` TV 's '' come from ? </p> <p> I think you have been misinformed !! </p>
Hello , My daughter went to this kindergarten and it was appalling , they have one TV room . However , it seems the teachers leave the children there . I did not like this kindergarten at all , there are no British teachers . I tried to communicate with the manager who smelt like she had been smoking , her mannerism was very unprofessional . Upon communication with the teachers , it seemed none of them had any experience or a bachelors degree . This nursery is a disgrace to the British system , such a shame .
My kid goes to this Kindergarten and she is happy there . Sorry but it seems that your comments are too personal . You obviously had some personal bad intention by making this comments and anyone can see that .
I do n't really get where Kiwi is getting her info from . I think it 's a ` disgrace ' and ` shameful ' that she is trying to incite hate when she is so clearly misinformed . I also do n't know why she is commenting on a post from a year ago . I smell sour grapes . Anyways I 'm only commenting because I read her/his reply and I am appalled by why he/she is trying to slander such a lovely kindergarten . My son goes to Rising Stars and it has by far exceeded my expectations . Everyone is friendly and polite , and the manager has always been professional in my presence . The children are definitely not left in the TV room all day , I have been at different times of the morning to pick up my son -LRB- we travel a lot -RRB- and he has always been in the classroom with his teacher . Also to my knowledge they do follow the British curriculum for a kindergarten , and my son has flourished since attending . He cries when he is sick and ca n't go to school . As for your comment about ` British teachers ' , again as far as I know , they are n't all British but they are all English native speakers -LRB- apart from the Arabic teacher and assistants -RRB- . I do n't really want to sound like an ad for Rising Stars or waste my time on a post that was made a year ago , so I would urge people to see for themselves what it is like , as my husband and I are extremely pleased with it .
If you want a visa for Britain , here 's the link for you . www.vfs-uk.com.qa Embassy of the United Kingdom 4962000
1 - st you go cornis and ask bootman about visa , 2 - nd go air port and ask pilot about visa and say him can you drop me in LONDOA , ... ... ... ... lol COME ON DUDE JUST VISIT U.K VISA CENTER NEAR NATIONAL OPP Q.TEL ... ... . . CHEER
you have to fill ONLINE APPLICATION FORM which is quite long and requires alot of details . Moreover , you have to book confirmed ticket copy and email confirmation -LRB- copy -RRB- of a hotel in advance or to provide them complete address where you will be living and with whom . They will ask for ur Bank 's SALARY STATEMENT -LRB- 6 months -RRB- & SALARY LETTER from ur employer . Original passport having atleast 3 or 6 months -LRB- not sure -RRB- validity from its expiry date . . Its very easy to get VISIT VISA if ur living in Qatar for more than 1 year atleast will be beneficial for u and if ur born in Qatar then 100 % success chance . Anyhow , still see their site for fresh information on HOW TO GET VISIT VISA of U.K. ??? . Good luck and enjoy U.K. as i did alot with my wife
u can apply from British Embassy airport road qatar

I have had Hankook tires before and they were some of the best I 've experienced ... ever ! http://www.hankooktiresreview.org/2011/09/hankook-suv-tires-review/ Awesome off-road tires too .
DP .
LP at least I earned a point for the comment .
There are a lot of places that fit this description , with the exception of reasonable , of course . Rents in Doha are about 4 times what they are in the US and that is mostly because employers pay the bills . Is your husband 's company not covering housing ? How about school tuition ? These are considered standard perks in Doha . I would suggest coming to see first . You REALLY do n't want to rent sight unseen here . There are too many nasty surprises .
barwa appartments are real great -
I doubt if above answers r given by professionals ?
Uarif , I was in this situation recently and I can assure you , from personal experiences , that without NOC you can not enter the country on a visit or business visa . If your family is still in Doha -LRB- Father , Mother , Brother etc -RRB- you can enter on a family visit visa which is valid for one month extendable upto six months . That is the only option that you have . Of course , if you are holding another GCC RP , then you can enter with an on-arrival visa -LRB- provided your profession falls in the eligible category -RRB- . Make sure that the first time you fly to Doha in this instance , you fly via the national carrier i.e. Qatar Airways . Hope this was helpful .
@visibly hidden , do you know anybody , traveled to qatar with on arrival visa during ban period , who is a GCC resident
Either u hav to complete 2 years before u enter Qatar or you need to get the NOC from ur previous employer ...
You will need NOC
What kinda bike are you looking for ? I got tons of friends with bikes .

Hello , does anyone knows anything about used sport bikes , any news will be helpfull

Thanks for your tips and advice :-RRB- very much appreciated . .
Most welcome . . :-RRB-
Lots of spice shops in Souq Waqif , but if u are looking for specific indian pakistani spices , Go to LULU and by SHAN / MEHRAN masala =-RRB-
go to Souq Waqif u will find all of them ...
And even in Lulu Hyper Market or FFC also you will get but in Souq Waqif you will get most fresh and best prices ...
Speedy - Go to the Irani Souq - i think thats Souq Wakif for you . You will find an array of shops with fresh spices of the very best quality over there .

You can go to the obvious places such as carrefour , lulu and Virigin . As for the authorized apple sellers , there 's around two over in city center , one near the cinema on the top floor . Hope i helped : D
Apple Stores are known as iSpot.I saw one at City Center and Villaggio . Not sure about others .

I gave my medical test for RP at Emadi Hospital on July 28th 2012 but till now I have not received the medical test results.I enquired at hospital , they told me that they have sent the report to medical commission.What I should do ?
rambo , otherwise check MOI site follow ure visa it may appear there , if the result is ok then fill that arabic form online n go for finger print .
@slayerfaith - so how do you obtain a permit ? Or does anyone else out there know ?
You work out with your physician at home how much you will need for your time away . It 's also possible to have a friend carry it for you .
If it is for your own consumption and you have the prescription just bring it in with you in your handbag .
why ?
It 's a good airline ... good service by ground staff ... the only thing is that one has to pay for the food and soft drinks ... sorry no liquor is served ... I had good experience traveling couple of times ... go ahead
how much ticket from U.A.E. dubai to doha qatar .
hmmmpp ... First time to hear about Air Arabia .
One of the best in this sector . Book in advance you get good deals . You can also order food in advance . New aircrafts and very good service over all .
And a user friendly website .
Carrefour .
Nookiw with the air crew ?
Cabin crew dressed in new outfits maybe ?

This will irk them more and if you are a local , probably they will not say anything else , but if not , then expect a real beating and you can write all about your misadventures from the hospital bed ... :-RRB- Hope this helps ...

I think the Singer store that is on a roundabout near the souks , they usually have threads and binding materials .
Because IMF just sell a record quantity of gold to the Central bank of India and look like China will follow suit . Also because people are nervous about holding on to the US dollar due to the US inflation rate and the perceived slowness of recovery compared to the other economy . Bad news for those receiving their income in US dollar or other currencies fixed-pegged to the greenback -LRB- such as Qatari Riyals -RRB-
Its because the dollar is tumbling and festival and marriage season in India
it is the international trend ; recently India bought a significant quantity of gold and it seems to go on buying , from FMI ; so the price grows up . Check the international market trend , now is around 1100 US$ / ounce , after the FMI sold cca 1/2 from it 's reserve of cca 400 tons gold . Will increase in my opinion , too , because in crisis everybody invests in gold .
Low dollar price pushes up the gold price as a hedge against possible future inflation .
Due to high demand of gold in India & other country because of festival and safe money to invest .
I hope so . .
Thank you for comments :-RRB- I will check all of them . There is no big choice :-LRB- I hope they have a place .
one of the International Schools , like London International School ? They have specific progrmmes for children with english as a second language .
Most of this schools required entry tests - English and maths . My son will not pass it , especially not language test . In Montesorri told me that only Cedars specialize in English as a second language . I sent an e-mail to them one week ago and they did n't reply :-LRB- I think I must go there . It seems to be a problem to put my son to a school ... Ewa
I looked at Cedars for my children it seems very good , you should give them a call .
Yes , I will go there next week . I hope they will have a place for him :-RRB- Thak you

Dr. Kusum Arora in Appollo Clinic , I am not aware about test fees in appolo , she was running her own Clinic but now joined Appolo . anyway treatment in Qatar is very expensive .
Apollo is the worst ... the best is Al-Ahli , Dr.RIzvi and Dr. Sujata . . if you need good service on cheap cost then Hamad is the best ...
Dr KUDSIA BEGUM . opposite Q.TEL , El , Waab just before the traffic light
alilei ... she said , aside from khudsia . she might not want to see that doctor .
Dr Leelamma Clinic located at Al Saad
check in Al-Ahli . . they have good ones . Hamad is one of the best in country too . . moreover its also cheap . KIMS Medical Center in Wakra is another option to find good indian gync .
Do n't forget to visit the labor camps , and bring some food for the poor people there . Otherwise you wo n't have seen Dubai .
After living there for 10 years I can say it is good but get yourself out of there and visit Oman , Hatta Fort and Abu Dhabi . You 're kidding yourself .
visit the jumairah beach , the Gold Souq in Sharjah , but do n't forget to visit the world 's largest mall the dubai mall which has a largest aquarium in the world and their biggest skating rink ... since the heat is coming , have some fun in Wild Wadi Theme Park ... that 's the best ... have picture taking at best landmarks in dubai ...

The beaches are pretty awesome . Theres this place called `` The walk '' which is an amazing set of restaurants/shops by the beach . I also went to the old souk area which has interesting art galleries and was quite the contrast , I wish I had gone on a boat ride . Hope you have fun .
Go to desert safari , they have awesome belly dancing show and henna tattooing after the safari . Since it 's summer , frolic in the pristine white sand of Jumeirah beach or if you can not take the scorching heat anymore , go to The Mall of the Emirates , they have the famous Dubai Ski . You can ski , stroll or just enjoy the coolness of snow right inside the mall . Or you may also try the fun rides in Wild Wadi & have loads of fun swimming in the pool . The list goes on and on . . Enjoy !

I loorrveee Wild Wadiii and Ski Dubaiii ! Go to the Mall of the Emirates , a bloody huge mall , a woman 's fantasy , well some anyway . As far as the skiing goes , its good , you can snowboard also , there is about 4 slopes , about 400 metres long , and steep . You should try it , its easy to get up the hill . Its just the tumbling down that 's fun . Its like playing bowling with humans . Lol .

for sure you do n't know what is a nice smell if you 're from india ~ you guys have this strong bonds to each another , this common smell you guys have is just one example .
your peculiar smell and his heavenly perfume must be creating an out of this world concotion . Look on the bright side , if you two colloberate and get into the perfume and cosmetics business you both would have an outstanding product to keep away crawling and flying insects
FU they are all connected . It 's easy to see that the companies did n't contact the OP for any job because of his smell . He only applied online should be ignored for the sake of the healthy discussion we are having here .
WK - Companies did n't contact him because he has a moustache on his cheap X-ray maybe .

I am good Betty . . How are you . . I think it 's ok to hijack this thread now .
Some of your points are valid . I think we all know nepotism is rife . We all know that ` some ' people over here apply for jobs they are not qualified for and indeed get them as somebody in HR knows them and they are from the same area . It has been pointed out many times by many people , including me . However , I would now not post anymore if I were you . You will get stalked and insulted ! There is no point in pointing out the obvious . I have learnt this the hard way .
roy2jacinto ... I suppose this guy at your office has taken a liking for you and you for him and though you say you want to get away you seem to be stuck in there by choice . Have fun and enjoy the once in a lifetime experience and till the salary keeps coming dont complain much
la la la , no complains mate . i love this job , i have so many extra time for extra activities . lol ! i do n't care about them .

I have n't tried wall climbing , but it sure looks fun . . maybe sometime in the near future , I 'll have the courage to try it ... : P

Hi RobertDowneyJnr , Im moving out to Doha in two weeks and Im a keen outdoor Pursuits enthusiast , Especially climbing , jet ski and kayaking . Would be interetsed in meeting up if you have found some activities going on out there . Let me know Pete
I 've found it for 200QR for 1kg in the chemist , far too expensive .
very expensive ... order it online from UK ... no prob ...
try GNC at Villagio or City Center . . They offer various protein supplements ... you can have a discount if you buy their products every first week of the month , as long as you avail their discount card ... valid for one year
Last time I looked in GNC they only had egg protein , and it was more than double the price I would pay in the UK . I was hoping for other suggestions , but thank you .

i applied for job in qatar airways do you think its easy to get as i am having 24 years experience in qatar
Yes you can through us . Singapore Cargo Contact : 44342361 / 44431492 / 44413019
They will charge you more than tv 's price as duty charges . best option is to carry with you .
Packaging and shipping will cost you approx . 1000 riyals .
If it is to Kerala you can use either Al Suwais or Singapore Cargo which are more reliable .
Wait untill ur vacation and carry it by urself ... Safe & Save ... for sure .
If you are sending a TV thru cargo be prepared for it to reach its destination in bits and pieces . Best option - carry it with you . better safe than sorry .
Sending LCD TV thru cargo services in Qatar means , u will get it in pieces at your destination !! I sent a microwave oven , paying special packing charges thru Al suwais cargo n received it in damaged condition !!
I applied but they told me that i can apply only in the main immigration building in madinat khalifa , and there is a different form .
by vaasta only ... ? vaasta means strong source , relations .
and did you applied ?
I meant did you get the visa ?

Congratulation . I am sure QL ladies will guide you the best doctors . BTW Hamad Women Hospital is good .
hi , lets congrats u first . i do n't know ab that doctor . but here Zinath Rizwi at Al Ahli hospital is best . but bit expensive . depends on u. if u want indian doctors u can get in Apolo , and at AL rafa poly clinic there 's DR. Hema rajiv she 's good nd nd u can affordable .
Dr KUDSIA BEGUM Location : Before traffic light intersection Al.Waab coming from Villagio on your right .
Congratulations ! Try Dr. Shahata of Hamad Womens .
To start off you could go and see the lovely , kind and brilliant Dr Adnan . He is private , you pay about 200QR for a full scan and consult , your husband can comein with you and he will advise you who to see and you can get some great pictures with the most advcanced 4D scanner in Doha . I will post his details in a minute , you do n't need an appointment as long as you have an RP , just take your ID and go on a Saturday morning . He has helped me SO much and referred me to other doctors when needed .
His name is Dr Adnan Issam Abdulkader , Al Mirqab Street , tel 4358019 . The best time to turn up is about 9am on a Saturday morning but take warm clothes for the waiting room , its freezing !
No doubt about it , Dr. Stephan Shwaiger - Al Ahli Hospital is the best ever !!!! I recently gave birth to a beautiful baby girl , he 's amazing ... i also recommended Dr. Shwaiger to my two pregnant friends , they also said the same thing .
I Prefer Dr KUDSIA BEGUM
Wow , congratulations to you ! : - -RRB-
CONGRATS ... I used to advise Dr Khudisa Begum earlier . But some of the recent expereience with some of my friends , were not so good . Still she is a good doctor , no doubt Why dont you try Dr Leelamma , near Abu Hamour road , opposit to the Petrol station . I heard good about her
As long as i know , it is tru ! , i 'm also working in govt . sector -LRB- oil field -RRB- , and we are not getting jordanian visas , even for business visit -LRB- 14 days -RRB- , we are submitting for special approval .
Unfortunately , this is what all say . . and even employees from egypt ... better to search in an other country ... good luck

correction : i do not think Jordaninas are not allowed here , i witnessed very little number of cases being banned , keep your hope . A lot of Jordanians obtained visas last two months so that should assure you
Yes , absolutely correct ... I strongly advice you to find job somewhere else ... my experience recommend UAE Dubai . .
yes they can not get new resident visa for them in all companies
what is the root cause ?
any issue related to this is mainly because of political issue or non cooperation between Qatar and the other country . in plus , they are banned because of the palestinians who have jordanian papers . there are too many here and the qatari goverment should make equilibrium between all nationalities ! i advice u not to ask for Borrow visa or to shift ur visa . u ll be banned 100 % .
Yes its true dat Jordanians nationalities are now not getting visas , being in HR i also tried for their visa but no use , they can reniew the old residence but there is no chance for getting new visa . Yallah bro best of luck , everything happens for good so dont loose hope Allah Mak . .
yes unfortunatly ... they reject my wife visa also since she is jordanian ... even i satisfied all the conditions from ministry and rent home and every thing . i called jordanian embassy and they told me the same .
I Heard this ... Jordonians and egyptians are inhold to enter qatar for employment .

how do you plan to get it through customs ?
Didnt realise there were any snakes over here !!
yes it works right after camera clicks . .
detectors arent of any use in Qatar . . if u really wana be not caught , try getting a radar jammer . . widely available in Europe n America . be careful while getting it into Qatar .
is it difficult for you to follow the traffic rules ?
yes it is open in the morning on Friday and Saturday and the prices are really good
ohh sorry i forget the timing it open from 9 to 1 in morning on Friday and Saturday .
i am new in doha , let me know the location
Ur first delivery was a C-section so da second one will also be da same ... ...
As far as I know , You have to buy or arrange all your & your baby 's necessities yourself because the hospital provides only a disposable cap a dress . Pampers & a feeder on request they may provide !
in answer to your question - a baby is a baby no matter what method you deliver the baby . You will need : 1 -RRB- babygro for baby , 2 -RRB- Hat 3 -RRB- Scratch mitts 4 -RRB- Clothes and toiletries for yourself - INCLUDING a bit of makeup as this will make you feel better when your hormones are all over the place . 5 -RRB- Light blanket for baby 6 -RRB- Extra nappies and milk/bottles incase of emergency -LRB- hospital staff to busy to get your something asap -RRB- 7 -RRB- Maternity pads and breast pads for yourself - with a few changes of underwear . 8 -RRB- As hospitals are boring ... maybe a book for yourself ? Its better to be prepared with everything than not have anything when you REALLY need it .
THIS QUESTION REFERS ONLY UR HAPPINESS
Hi , now a days healthy competetion is there in telecommunication sector , comparatively as a old company Q-tel , s service is better than vodafone . But when u see as a new comer vodafone is performing better , q-tel coverage is better than vodafone all over qatar as well as internet . thank you ,
vodafone is the best ...
Q-tel rocks love it , have been using their services for the past 9 years , they have realy improved over the years . q-tel coverage is all over qatar as well all over the world . My Halla sim card worked in Paris , UK , US and India .
i read on QL a few months before , Vodafone is agreed to use Qtel data center that managed by qtel . so big possibility vodafone backbone still use Qtel network . so better to use qtel directly .
Many thanks for all the answers .
So far as I know you are not allowed to take your dog for walks on the corniche - nor are they allowed in any parks usually . Signature line > `` You ca n't fix stupid ''
The dog should not walk naked .
Those of you who have dogs , do you know of any place - preferably with a bit of greenery - that I can walk my dog ? The last place I tried was opposite Khalifa Stadium , I walked my dog there a few times but then last time a security guy showed up to tell me it was not allowed . Where ever I took her for a walk I heard the same . I do n't like to keep her locked in the house . any suggestions ?
I 've seen many people walking their doggies at the corniche . So if you want to walk your dog do it when there are less people around preferably during the mornings . If you do get caught i 'm sure they will let u off with a warning so relax . Why not just walk your dog around your living area ? Or as suggested take your dog to some beach . . the nearest beaches are miles away though :P Good Fortune always comes knocking at your door ... when you are sh * tting in the toilet !! :-RRB- <p> _ -LSB- -RSB- ~ <strong> </strong> ~ -LSB- -RSB- _ </p> <p> < img src = `` http://www.skamu.com/icons/animated/images/icon41.gif ''
I have been running on the corniche many times , and kept the dog on a short lead and picked up poo . A lady came to up to me and was very rude that I had the dog there so I walked over to the poilce on the R/A to ask if it was allowed , they said it was fine as long as it was on a lead and it left no mess .
HI , I would n't take it around people if it bit , but yes I agree .
Cornishe - I have done it many time - only had one incident with a local lady ... but others wise most people seem friendly and actually want to meet the dogs - and its mostly locals that ask :--RRB- I find if you keep away from between the Sheraton and where the dhows moor , you are ok - walk futher on towards the port and you should be ok :--RRB- But do m ake sure your dog is on a lead and you carry packets for pooh with you . visit www.qaws.org
I walk my dog everyday around the streets where I live . It is quite strange when people stop their cars and stare so I guess seeing a dog out for a walk is not very common . Most parks have signs saying no dogs and I can understand this because not everyone looks after their dog correctly or cleans up after it .
You CAN walk the dog on the paved part of the Corniche , you just ca n't take them into the grassy areas .
take him to the beach and let him free !!!!
You can take your dog at corniche without any problem . Angelo
You can not take your dog for a walk on the corniche . ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Heard your wife left you , How upset you must be . But do n't fret about it ... She moved in with me .
that palce for human beings not for ... . dogs ... this is look really bad.if some one bring dog on public palce . . so plz dont bring shining in the sun , like a pearl upon da ocean
Let the dog walk you . There is no law that prohibits dogs walking humans .
@ jack25 , you need to be locked in a room with some animal rights activists ... preferably armed ... dogs & other animals are God 's creation , just like you , how would you like it if in a dog 's world someone told you you were n't worthy enough to be t
uhaihauhhauha Boston !!
I thot you 'd be familiar with this ... but ... anyways ... here you go ... `` Dogs are considered too dirty to share house with people , and are banned from the Corniche . '' http://www.qatarvisitor.com/index.php?cID=414&pID=1234#ixzz0eaV96JYs http://www.qatarvisitor.com/index.php?cID=414&pID=1234
There used to be a sign that said dogs not allowed on the corniche . I was at the Pearl last week and the security asked a woman with a dog to leave . > May your dreams take you travelling all through your life .
I Have a constant Question ??? Why when I see a dog walking with someone always be a woman.I think this is a general phenomenon . Why girls & women preferring dogs from all animals . May they found Power , Guard , loyalty , trust to speak with Organism is sane ... .
AGAIN . . I HAV TO TAKE THE TEST ...
You can drive rent a car in UAE with Qatar Driving License . . same rule in Qatar but people misusing that is deferent story
temporarily you can . i was there for 2 months on a visit visa and used my Qatar drivers license on a rental car . you can not however exchange your Qatar license to a UAE license without going through a driving test .
u cant ues there becouse of rules is defrans
no its not you can get by this price better car if you can take it by 15000-18000 it will be good
faisal essa whre can i get hyundai coupe fx 2006 for 15000-18000 . . itz nt 2001 to get 4 15000 ... itz 2006 ... rinku itz better price u can go for it
rinku the price is good for that model but the only problem is that it has done 165000KM ... & thats too much ... so price is reasonable for that hyundai coupe model but if you see the Kms it has done then ofcourse the price is a lil high ... plus if its a V6 then you must know that the re-sell price value of V6 cars are less then V4 .
you be lucky to get around QR20K

good question ... but i 've been with some africans ... you ca n't stand with them ... atleast 100m required ! well no offense . . they work really hard .
I was on a return flight from Dubai and approx . 30 Ethiopians got on -LRB- I saw it on their passports -RRB- . Some of them smelled horrible . They appeared to be well dressed and appeared clean but smelled like ... cattle is the closest analog I can think of .
Regarding the term you used up there to describe the people of Pakistan ... It is usually considered offensive when used by a non-Asian ... http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Paki Regarding the thread ... oft discussed ... search before you post ... plus that 's offensive to a lot of people ...
Dude how do you know its coming exactly from underarm ? Smell polices again ! -- If you ca n't CONVINCE them , CONFUSE them !!!
It is not all , but most . And it is related to `` lifestye '' . They ca n't afford Boss and Channel , and Qatar ca n't afford to replace them with higer paid Europeans or even Arabs . It is not just the nuclear scientists who do what others generally can not do . It is also `` a public road sweeper does , what others can not generally do '' . Hope you got it .
reysaj I can bash every country in the world over one issue or another here , but you do n't always have to do what you can ... Just my thoughts . . Jackfrost I can get it from most of your posts that you are a very intelligent man but somehow I think you love provoking others , I always thought you did it to tease the hardliners but still it is unfortunate to see a smart man acting this way . .

I wish people would just stop pointing fingers -LRB- and noses -RRB- at all these little things ... life 's much more than that ... yes I do agree some of the practices of the people of Asia are well downright disgusting ... but generalization is far more disgusting ... plus no one is perfect ... the people who stink -LRB- usually -RRB- are those guys who work 10 to 12 hours a day in the sun and earn 600 to 800 riyals a month ... ca n't fault them for not using Boss or Lacoste ... give them a break people and thank God every time you come across a less fortunate person ... I am not trying to justify them ... but I just feel that just because we have been given the best in life -LRB- not by our virtue -RRB- does not give us the right to put down some one who is from a lower social strata ... My personal peeve is spitting ... when I see someone open a door and spit at a traffic light ... my first instinct is to go out and bang the door on his head ... but then I count from 1 to 10 and drive on ...

to keep urself clean and tidy from odour germs ... take bath daily ... and keep the body surface clean ... by the way i do n't think so anyone here is Sardar ... ; D
it 's not just the construction workers ... some who works in offices smell too . who dress clean and nice . really ... sometimes the smell can make you pass out or make your stomach churn . so gross ... : -LRB-
this is not a matter of perfume you are wearing but a matter of hygiene awareness . . even you pour a bottle of channel to your body and do n't bath daily still the same unlikely smell will overpower dude ...

there are do 's and do n'ts everwhere ... i met with one sardar and asked ... he replied that we do not remove our hear and if any tear from our body ... we fold in a peace of paper and save it ... its like what our tradition ...
but he used to cut his hair and shave ... so I do not know ... and ya I 've read that the Sikh never cut their hair ... has to do with tradition ... so with hair that long must be hard to take showers ... hmmm ... can you shed some light on this Mr. Sandeep ...
all of the above ... just hold your breath and keep distance with them ...
How long can you hold your breath , chinx ?
hahaha not for long . . if i cant stand it anymore i 'll run away from them .
. . and where to do you run in an airplane , for example ?? Or do you just pass out when flying ?
well i never get a chance to ride an airplane together with this pipz . . only here in qatar i discover such horrible unique smell ...
its a neglectgence of a person , a person who doesnt teach by their parents and their teachers in school for proper hygiene ...
South Asians with poor personal hygiene smell bad , it has to do with a combination of poor personal hygiene & their diet , i as a South Asian myself -LRB- NOT one with poor personal hygiene however ! -RRB- fully understand & accept that ... what i do not understand however is the Filipinos on here pointing fingers ??? ... i mean , NOTHING can smell as bad as filipino food , this is just my opinion & i 'm extremely tolerant when it comes to food , but that stuff , WHOA ! man , feel like throwing up every time i get a whiff of it & have to really restrain myself , it 's a VERY unpleasant odour , to put it as politically correct as i can ... i mean , the fish is mostly raw with the scales still on & the eye staring out @ you & the soups/sauces just smell REALLY bad & i 'm sure many non-filipinos will agree with me , but i 'm not going putting up a post on QL screaming , `` FILIPINO FOOD STINKS ! '' am i ? ... i hope people get my point here , ALL communities especially Asian ones will have issues about them that other communities find difficult to deal with , having a bit of a broader mind never hurt anyone , so to all my `` fresh smelling '' Filipino friends here , deal with your South Asian colleagues BO in the same way they deal with your FO -LRB- food odour -RRB- , fair enough ? ...

I used to know a `` paki '' high ranked engineer with big salary , he smelled like s *** , i found out later that he uses a certain oil , rubs all his body with it daily before coming to work . the smell was so disgusting that he was not allowed to enter some government offices !!!!!!!! yet , he never stopped rubbing : S Yalla !

No offense but I agree with jackfrost on his frist comment ... reality bites !
Only fools generalise , and there are many around . no offense ______________________________________________ - Listen to Many ... Speak to a Few -
why do n't you just accept it ! most of the indians here in doha really stinks , even ladies , not only in public bus but even here at the office and malls . Working under the sun for 12 hours is not a valid reason if you know how to take care of your arm pit .
The stink from the hardworking labors in sun dust is better than stinking comments of jackfrost whose brian is frosted any way , and those who have come to Qatar from the smoky mountains of Manila , biased , jealousy , keep your stinking comments to yourself.Nakumura why go so close to armpits of people .
Well manila is have a better smell than you ! __________________________________________ Life is short ... 300 meter before roundabout !

like i said `` Nakamura '' , you 're Japanese ... like the Pope is Irish ... speaking , reading & writing Japanese does n't MAKE you Japanese ... you 're a FAKE ... ` nuff said ...
FAKE ...
a Filipino guy PRETENDING to be Jap ... you could 've at least gotten a bit more imaginative with the name , i mean how cliched is `` nakamura '' ? ... POSER ...
arien , why do n't you just accept it that most of you does n't use deodorant and hardly take a shower in a day or week .
yeah h4t3 , ride the bus and you judge , try even in the morning were most people are supposed to be fresh ...
Sometimes it 's better to be talking to a stupid person than a person who stinks ... . did I generalize ? I said most of you , now do n't be offended and start taking a shower daily using soap and deodorant and you 'll see ...
U stink like a pig cuz u eat them ; -RRB-
@ Nakamura ... `` whatever '' is not the answer to my point , you 're a FAKE , you 're obviously Filipino but lack the national pride to put it up as your nationality stating `` Japanese '' instead & giving yourself a Japanese name , so please explain to
another stinky indian -LRB- Qnbagent -RRB-

Peace guys peace ... I seriously do n't understand why do they pinpoint South Asians ? Are the rest of the people in this world equally secreting and shitting roses and cologne perfumes ?? If someone smells odd , then the reason is obvious , poor hygiene ; and that 's his personal problem , not the country 's . I 've never been a smell police , but I bet I can find a handful of smelly people around the world . . So to those really like to bash S. Asians , I 'd say get a new , better topic ! . Do n't generalize a millions just because of a tens . The question itself stinks , please do n't make it stinkier with some rotten comments . <b> -- If you ca n't CONVINCE 'em , CONFUSE 'em !!! </b>

You know guys I 'd appreciate the time you gave into discussion of my thread . But I see someone is hurt or someone is pointing another . As an author , I would like to apologize for posting this topic because I felt responsible for unpleasant responses from other people . Its like somebody is throwing raze of fireball . Please let us not do that . My main purpose of this is to gather views about proper hygiene to which helpful to the people involve who are unaware to have the foul-smelling odor in their bodies . I am very unfortunate that I do n't have a PC of my own so I ca n't check my threads every now and then . You know it happens that I have many co-workers coming from those countries -LRB- opps ... I 'm not pointing a particular nationality -RRB- that have a foul-smell . They are not just ordinary workers huh , they are supervisors ... That 's why I 'm so disgusted and I 'm trying to avoid them and even holding my breath when encountering them . I hope the Mowasalat company would also encourage their drivers to be clean and defeinitely be free from the foul-smelling odor as they are serving the public because I 've observeD that there drivers have a stink odor too ... Guys , you can try this simple tip to lessen the foul-smelling odor of your colleage in the workplace : 1 . Please advise him/her to use a very cheap deodorant like Tawas or Potassium Alum . Do it in a secret and gentle manner . A variuos kind of deodorant is available in the market . 2 . Try to offer him/her a presents with a soap and deodorant inside . Use your initiative to do it so that the person is not offended . Above all , LET US MAKE PEACE , NOT WAR .
SHOWER EVERYDAY AND RUBBING A LEMON ON UNDERARM WILL DO.EVEN YOU WORK 10-12 HOURS A DAY STILL ITS NOT AN EXCUSE FOR BAD ODOR. : -RRB-
yup mary i 'm doing the same thing.if i see someone near to me i automatically hold my breath as well otherwise i 'll pass out . . lol ...
In the western world you are all Asian . why do you Asians say South Asian . i dont see anyone say North Asians , West Asians . or East Asiand . racist all of you and you say western are racist , , Rules are a guideline for intelligent people , but they must be adhered to by idiots .
I was cut off heading down row by a middle class indian , he was not a labour , he stank . . the SMELL . . , it was only 10:00 am , , , the smell was shocking , , GET OUT OF MY WAY , , Guys when you go out shopping PLEASE Wash. . you bloody stink ...

The more the couple advertise it the more chances that the police will raid the flat ...
Unless you go around shouting `` WE 'RE NOT MARRIED BUT LIVING TOGETHER '' the chances of anyone knowing are pretty remote .
Chances = one unmarried couple divide by the total number of unmarried couples in doha
it depends on what position they are caught in
the chances depend entirely on the accuracy and source of the information provided .
and the news out is they normally check out the kabayan only , kerala only accomodation on a priority basis as they may find something besides the normal going on out here at this places
Depends on how you go along with your neighbors and the people around you , aside from your partner .
so it all depends on the info given to the raiders huh ... then maybe its better to check any flats in surprise !
I think it is in Al rayyan road opp ; HMC Thanks ,
do you know what are the procedure of submitting papers for evaluation in dental assistant nursed ?
http://www.qatarliving.com/answers/health-and-fitness/where-is-the-office-locationaddress-of-ministry-of-health With regards to registration to NHA as an Assistant Nurse , you better go directly to NHA office . They will give you all the required documents including the steps in processing your application . Regards !!
Ministry of Health has been transferred to the building beside the former Olympic Village , opposite the military camp near the fire station . Just bring all your authenticated documents and submit it to the one in-charge of evaluation .
`` Please not answers like they will start in summer ! '' so what kinda answer u looking for ?
Still in the logistic stage
they will start in summer ! This is a project that will take years , and will surely overrun any budget or schedule -LRB- just like any civil construction project here ... -RRB- Even if somebody says that they will start on 1/4/2009 and be finished by 15/6/2011 , it means NOTHING .
It is ON HOLD , unofficially ofcourse !!
If you like books , I recommend to get a Kindle . Not much to find here ... and the prices are high .
what kind of books you looking for ?
Both QAWS and QVC have second hand books for sale at a very good price - all money to help animals . Also look out for table top sales and take a big bag . Or come to my house and borrow some !
Thanks I was thinking of just having a wonder around and probably sport/bio books but as nomerci rightly pointed out , it might be time to go onto a kindle but like the browsing thing in a shop . Thanks for the replies .
as i said . . you guys just dont answer questions normally .
and i wont do it if its actually illegal . . im not stupid .
Officially it 's illegal , but so long as you do n't go out of your way to be blatantly obvious you 'll be fine .
Its not legal in any way . One can continue to date as long as the days are in your favour , while your time runs bad , you will end up in dieting -LRB- instead of dating -RRB- in D-cell street # 1 . You being new , think about decent survival .

Of course u can date and hangout with a girl until u r being caught ... Have a great time . .
LOL at avaya . . I 'm also new here and i was thinking to ask the same question . . but i change my mind :D
It 's good to see that you moved to Qatar with high hopes and great optimism ... as some suggested , date till you get caught ... then you will be hosted for a whole year in a cell and you 'll get a free ticket back home ... not a bad deal ! : -RRB-
Samsung Omnia I is available in Carrefour Citycentre for QR1850 . What features does Omnia II have over Omnia I ?
However , if you are interested in HD2 , I have one for sale . Contact me if you are interested . To mention some benefits of HD2 over Omnia II : HD2 has a scratch resistant screen -LRB- Glass covered -RRB- HD2 has 448 MB RAM . Omnia II only has 256 MB . HD2 has multi touch input gestures . HD2 will be upgradeable to windows mobile 7 , omnia II wo n't be . HD2 has a 1Ghz Snap Dragon -LRB- Qualcom -RRB- processor . It is not just 200 Mhz faster , it 's ligtning fast compared to Samsung proprietary 800 Mhz !! And yes , Samsung has a better screen display -LRB- AMOLED -RRB- , but AMOLED will wear out with time and its brightness will reduce with time . Everything comes with a price . Hope this helps .

LOL . . Aight , thanks for the info moonface =-RRB- . . One more thing though , I heard about Madi-Internationl . . Does it offer a Diploma in Hairdressing and Make-up or is it only Hair products supplier for salons !? Cheers .
1 -RRB- It depends , some companies pay much better than others.There is no fixed pay amount , this depends on a lot of issues . 2 -RRB- You can expect these benefits as well , but some companies do not reduce the salary , they merely adjust the basic pay with other benefits in order to fit the persons qualifications and experience on the job . 3 -RRB- Driving license is good to have , many companies usually prefer an applicant with a driving license but it 's not important to get employed , unless you are applying for marketing or PR jobs for example .

Why not contact UDC , if they are your developer , to get a clear picture -LRB- good or bad -RRB- , rather than rely on others , who may or may not be well-informed and could be giving you accurate information or idle speculation ? I am also an investor in The Pearl , and have found , in all my dealings with UDC -LRB- ie the people at the Oyster -RRB- , that they are very professional , helpful and transparent . They will tell you the situation as it stands now , progress and delays , because it is in their interests to ensure that investors have confidence in them and their project . My apartment is in Viva Bahriya , so not due for completion yet . It is hard to wait , because once you 've been down and seen for yourself the scope of the project , you just want to move in and enjoy sitting on your balcony overlooking the sea . Ignore the snipers , stay cool , it will be worth the wait !
I know it is hard to wait , especially given the current economic uncertainty , but none of us -LRB- including the developer and the banks -RRB- could have predicted what has happened , on a global scale , over the last few months , so we are all having to adjust to the new reality which we didnt foresee when we originally made the investment . As any investment is about confidence , it does n't make sense to ` talk down ' the project , or encourage rumours about how awful the project is . If you look at other threads on this subject , you can see that those directly involved in the construction are all proud of it : only those unconnected but with ` inside knowledge ' -LRB- ie from friends of friends -RRB- are predicting doom . Again , I suggest that you go down to the site and speak to the developer to get a clearer picture which will help you plan .
No one lives at the Pearl yet . As there is no water or electricity services yet . UDC and Kharamma are locked in a power struggle over costs and the poor buyers of flats are the losers .
Having followed up with UDC , I have learned that the issue with the power supply was in fact resolved almost 2 weeks ago and they expect people to be living in Porto Arabia by the end of May . Please do n't take my word for this , -LRB- after all I could just be another one spreading rumors -RRB- , check with them yourself to see how your property fits into the schedule . Hope it goes well for you !
I talked to UDC and they said their towers will be opened in May . Electricity and water problems are solved and ready for all porto arabia . I guess in the 4th Quarter of this year , most of the towers will be opened . I was in Abu Dhabi at the weekend and stayed in one of my friends apartment . His apartment is having a magnificent sea view next to beach -LRB- like the apartment in the pearl -RRB- . It gives me some idea how the life will be in the pearl ; simply `` dolce vita !!! '' . Most of the people living in Doha can not imagine the life style in the pearl and when it will be completed , I am sure it will be one of the dream place to live in . So , we waited a lot but I guess it will worth it !
Istavrit , I was down there this week as well and totally amazed at the progress , especially with the shops -LRB- OK , just need the money to buy -RRB- , cafes and landscaping . The waterfront is beautiful and the atmosphere unlike anywhere else in Doha , more reminiscent of Palm Beach or parts of Europe . The project is really moving on and taking shape .

Thanks for the replies . I too am an american engineer , and look forward to experiencing living in a different part of the wold . My company is providing housing , and I was looking for insight from an independent source . Thanks again .
I have been wondering this also ... I see lots of British and Canadian folks ... I know there has to be some Americans here ... must be an underground thing .
All of Doha is safe . Everyone here is mixed nationalities . It 's much more fun that way ! What 's the point of going abroad if you do n't want to meet other cultures ? I am American , working for an American company , but on my company compound my neighbors are from all over the world . Most companies place their employees in housing -LRB- easiest and cheapest way to go . -RRB- Only place to avoid is the Industrial area , but since you are lucky enough not to be a 3rd world laborer , you have no worries there .

many changes . .
boys start getting BalD ... : -LRB-
Rizks , dont be jealous on seeing Jayesh hair ... lol
Everything happens and changes as per ones fate . girls are praised when that turns good and blamed when that reversed back .
the boy become gay ! Lol !!!
lol NGTD
in the earrly stages boy cares tooo much 4 the girl ... thinks , talks , listens only his girl ... in the middle stage boy & girl cares each other & gradually boy gets fed up ... boy thinks how to get rid of her ... men gets bored very soon .
definitely he will become a man ...
lol asif . .
The difference can be Sachin Tendulkar ... compared to Vinod Kambli . Sachin had a steady girlfriend very early in life I guess from age 13 onwards whom he later on married . This would go on to be instrumental and had his feet on firm ground when he found name and fame . Comparatively Vinod Kambli went crazy after getting fame and women ... he even had an early divorce . At that point in time Vinod Kambli was knocking up double centuries when Sachin was struggling to score centuries ... today its a completely differently story . Consistent Sachin is head and shoulders above all cricketers the world has ever known ...
Girl in Boy 's life Before Marriage : The boy very active , always thinking of her and do anything for her . and after Marriage : The boy become very lazy and fat , always thinking about other girls and do anything for other girls .
Mohamod , is your problem with your GF which you mentioned in your previous post solved ? You could tell us what change she brought in your life .
changes can be positive/negative based on the Girl & Boy .
You 're saying a girl can get a guy pregnant ? read the title my friend : - -RRB-
the Changes 1 - be blind can not see anybody except her 2 - Not hearing can not hear only her 3 - can not speak -LRB- only lesteining to her -RRB- 4 - not using his mind -LRB- she use her mind for him -RRB- 5 - not breathing -LRB- she will use all the oxgyn -RRB-
on a private basis ??? you ca n't do that .
hi let me know if some can tell u what exactely the right requirement , I myself interested in the same business all the best
I will suggest you to contact Joanna Kay in Sunbeam Kindergarten or may be Kimberly in Starfish Lane or may be any other Kindergarten running and speak with the Director and learn from their experience !! I hope it will help you !
I assume you are planning to set up kindergarden school -LRB- Nursery -RRB- at your villa right ? 1 -RRB- First of all , I do not think you can open something commercial business while you are residing in the same villa -LRB- you got to acquire new villa/building which should be vacant -RRB- 2 -RRB- Of course for any business in Qatar , you need a Qatari Sponsor -LRB- even WLL or Qatari Proprietorship -RRB- 3 -RRB- Then usual documentation like Chamber of Commerce -LRB- for name registration -RRB- , Commercial Registration , Rental Agreement , Municipality Inspection/Approval , Computer Card , Labour Ministry Registration etc. . If WLL , you may have to go to Ministry of Economics & Commerce for the registration of Articles of Association -LRB- Partnership Deed -RRB- . The documentation either you can do it on your own going step by step or can hire the services -LRB- PRO -RRB- against payment . Hope you must have got some idea , all the best .
PLZ CONTACT ME ON MY PM
if the accomodation n the transportation is provided , just bring 2k qatari riyal would be more than enough ~ but still it depends on how u eat , if everyday you re talkin bout hotel dining , then please bring more
5000QR
10,000 QR is enough for u.
yeah i think 10000 will do
u can keep abt 500-1000 . but u can ask ur company for advance payment of your salary ...
well it depends on several things , are you staying in a hotel or you have the accommodation provided by the company , Rent for one bedroom -LRB- studio -RRB- is around 4,000 / month two bedrooms for 6,500 / month or more if fully furnished or not . Furnishing an appartment will take around 4,000 and more , food & beverage around 2,000 - 3,000 . And then u have transportation if you will use a bus one way ticket is 3 qr the cab minimum around 18/trip depends on the distance but it is extreemle hard to find a cab sometimes so you will have regular people stop to pick u up -LRB- for money off course , around 30 qrs minimum , u can book a cab on the phone :-RRB- , so you will need around GBP 2,700 ... Hope this helps

hi which one u need sp1 , sp2 , sp3
I heard minimum three months gap between exit & re entry . Btw how many months visa ur having now ? 3month or 6 months .
You need to have minimum 3 months gap to apply again ... <!--break-->
If you could more elaborate that would be easy for us to tell you ... If you got an Extension off 5 months in total 6 , you will have to exit and your Husband can apply again after 3 months , but mostly after 2 months Immigration approves the Application for Family Visit Visa ...
commercial bank and my friends is in IBQ
4000 QR ,
oh well thank you very much .
is that all or is there any other criteria ?
ur sponsor will confirm by a letter to the bank that he ll deposit ur salary in the same bank for the loan period .
4k is the requirement . . but you have to check first if your company is accredited by your bank . . other wise check for the bank where your company is accredited then transfer your account their . .
same question
here are some things that might help . firstly , the bare minimum stuff . 1 -RRB- salary of 7000 or higher -LRB- sometimes they approve for 6000 also -RRB- . 2 -RRB- six months bank statement with salary transfer . 3 -RRB- you need to be an rp holder . 4 -RRB- your designation on visa shld be respectable . something like engineer or doctor or manager or accountant etc. . believe me point 4 is the most important . i have a friend who earns 15k per month , but due to lack of visas his company had given him a field operator visa for temp purposes , and now he is not able to sponser his wife . now that you got the basics straight ... you need a few documents . 1 -RRB- go to some arabic typing guys near sofitel -LRB- there are lots of them there -RRB- . 2 -RRB- they have a sample of no objection certificate . get it typed in arabic with your details . 3 -RRB- get the offer letter -LRB- they have sample -RRB- also typed from them . 4 -RRB- get 3 copies of 2 & 3 and get them signed and sealed from ur sponsor . 5 -RRB- take those docs to the labour department and submit them . they will keep 1 copy and return you 2 more . keep 1 for yourself and give 1 to your employer / sponsor . if you already have a 6 month bank statement , then you can readily apply for an rp . if not , you can get your wife here on a visit visa and later convert it to rp . to apply for or visit visa , get the visa form filled -LRB- from same sofitel place -RRB- and take it to any visa centre -LRB- meisaimer center is good as it has good number of counters -RRB- . all the best .

thanks drsam . do you know if deificiency can cause low mood , anxiety etc
the link between Vitamin D deficeincy and depression -LRB- bipolar disorder , low-mood ... -RRB- exists . scientific studies place hypovitD as a risk factor , not a triggering causal factor of depression . tableF-6 Evidence Map for Neuropsychological Functioning page 1022 http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13050&page=1022
Polly , I 'm sure the doctor might have suggested you weekly tablets and injection for vitamin D 's deficiency . You should add some nutritious food in your diet , take full cream milk , mixed fruit salad , vegetables especially beet root ... it will improve your condition ISA .
Vitamin D is used by the body to process calcium for the bones . It 's naturally occurring when you 're in the sunlight . I strongly suggest that you take a walk after you eat right before sunset . Make sure that you eat calcium containing products -LRB- milk , cheese -RRB- as well as items from all the food groups -LRB- vegetables , meat , dairy -RRB- . If you are lactose intolerant , try taking calcium supplements . It 's best if u allow your body to produce vitamin D naturally instead of taking medication .
This is very common in Doha now a days , causes yet to know.But frankly speaking you did not mention here how much the value you have at present by the blood test revealed.As I do practice here first re-place the insuficiency by injections why ? ofcourse the potiency of the drug will rapidly get to the noraml target i.e. 30-8o . Your doctor will investigate why you have this deficiency could be any reason for that . Exposer to Sun will just normally help every one but sudden low should be properly investigate.Till then cheers !!
Hi Shinewood , I am at a score of around 10 and this after a medication of 1.5 months . Can vit d deficiency cause depression like symptoms ? My doctors feel i may have an absorption issue . thanks all for responding
This is what i would like to say earlier may be you have an issue of absorption problem.Not only depression may take you many other problems
This is bizzare ! The sunlight triggers Vitamin D production . Is n't there enough sun here ? Of course , if you cover up , you 'll have to suffer .
if the UV index is 2 , 30 min in the sun exposing as much of ur skin , twice aweek at noon . UV2 IN DOHA : from november to february . UV = 3 10 min 2 times a week at noon . uv3 in doha : sept , oct , march , april at noon summer before 11:00 and after 15:00
drsam ... thats great info . Noted .
however all official studies ca n't recommend sunlight exposure for vit D since toomany risks -LRB- DNA deterioration , cancer skin , sun stroke , eye problems ... -RRB- and to many parameters -LRB- skin color , location , time , UV index , ... -RRB- these official studies stress on the intake or vit D. for the ultime reference -LRB- a 1100 + pages -RRB- that sum up all researches , and all previous studies : http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13050 not for faint hearted tho ! have a look .
It mainly affects local woman as they cover up too much . Vit D is produced natuarally by your body on exposure to sun light . Only in extreme cases should you need supplements .
mr shyams im planning to go by land to bahrain as well . maybe you can give me some tips after you 've completed the drive . Be safe !
i will post here after my trip . i am traveling with Garmin assistance . so can even share the route if you have a GPS .
Just follow the coast ;-RRB- Are n't visas going to be more the problem when you go through saudi ? As Balders mentioned , Uni stand good , i was there last year . Reasonable ticket and you see more of the track , start , first bend , and also some of the middle of the track .
Saudi visa is the nightmare . i doubt on it being umra time ... lets see . for fellas planning to take road to bahrain for F1 , better act now and apply for saudi visa . saudi embassy might close for the umra . i was suppose to go last week but due to visa delay postponed to this week ... . Bahrain visa -LRB- if needed -RRB- could be obtained online with evisa service or at causeway . for evisa , apply a week prior , this will save the hassle at causeway . best wishes .
Can you hire a boat/yacht and sail to Bahrain ?
if that being the case Qatar airways would be at loss ... :--RRB- . and this is the most profitable route for Qatar airways . thats the reason the friendship bridge between doha and bahrain delayed , as per sources . .

I recommend everyone to go at least once in their lives . Yalla Bahrain . --------------------------------------------------------- I think you have me confused with someone who gives a sh1t .
When is the Bahrain F1 and how much are the tickets ?
Never seen Bahrain F1 but I went to Australian V8 super cars Championship in Bahrain last year and the animus was just amazing !
Al Hani , type `` Gulf Air Bahrain F1 '' and you 'll get your answers . I agree that everyone should do this once , but for me , once was probably enough . If you are planning to go , I recommend University Stand as you get to see a fair chunk of track from here .

What are you really up to ? -LRB- Gunpowder is a mixture of sulfur , charcoal , and potassium nitrate -RRB- .
Ha I am really up to amateur charcuterie , not bomb making ! I used to buy it in the UK although it is difficult to get hold of for exactly the reason you mention ... I used to make air dried hams , bacons etc , and saltpetre kills botulsim and keeps the meat a nice pink colour . I am wanting to make Kadid which is arabic air dried mutton , to make a tasty couscous ! There must be some kind of chemical supply co. here ...
You will need a special permit to bring any dual use chemical into the country , including : 1 . Civil Defense + Environmental Commission + Municipality approved storage facility 2 . Importation of hazardous substances must be specifically mentioned on company CR . You can not import hazardous substances in your personal capacity . 3 . In addition to the above , you will need to submit HAZMAT data sheet along with import documents to customs with civil defense and environmental approval with each and every consignment . 4 . If material is classified as explosive or highly flammable , you will also need to have the documents approved by ministry of interior -LRB- police -RRB- . This applies to anything from paint thinner to you name .
Wow thanks ... but I do n't want to import it - I just want to buy a couple of hundred grammes . You mention that you would need to complete that process to import e.g. paint thinner - however paint thinner is available for retail purchase in stores here , so presumably the restriction is on retailers , not retail buyers ... There must be a shop out there somewhere !!
Why not you use salt as a substitute afterall we know that these nitrates are now linked to so many types of cancers ?

Sports Car , manual is great . . Ordinary car , especially in Doha traffic , I prefer automatic . .
with this much traffic in doha waiting in the R/B or step by step in alnasr street in the Thursday evening the Automatic is the best But the most strong gearbox is the manual ones any way DRIVE SAFE :-RRB- <aÂ title=EverythingÂ youÂ needÂ toÂ knowÂ aboutÂ livingÂ inÂ Doha,Â QatarÂ href=http://www.qatarliving.com> <imgÂ src=http://static.qatarliving.com/badges/150x50_iloveqatarliving.gifÂ alt=EverythingÂ youÂ needÂ toÂ knowÂ aboutÂ livingÂ inÂ Doha,Â QatarÂ /> </a>
Automatic ... anywhere anytime ... Why to keep changing gears ? 1 . In automatic the chances of error during change of gear speed especially at roundabouts is zero . 2 . Also with automatic one can use both hands to control the vehicle at R/Abouts and dont have to keep shifting gears thereby giving improved control . The above 2 add to give one the split second advantage when other driver makes some error and you can either slow down abruptly or give way swiftly . And of course one can slow down to a halt and then accelerate in an instant without going from 4th gear to 1st and then 2nd and 3rd & finally 4th . The only advantage manual has is the pickup one can get from 1st gear and the driver decides when to switch to a higher gear and this is usually done faster manually .
Manual of course , u can control the car more . plus , sports cars are manual . .
<b> If you are about buy a new car I suggest manual . or else automatic . U might have to face many issues with gearbox/cluth alone if the vehicle is OLD . In the current situation in DOHA , many people will opt . for automatic transmission , but even its a sporty or non sporty vehicle , I love manual transmission . Think about manul if you are buying a new one . </b> `` Never love a person you can live with , Always Love a person you can never live without ''
As I said above ... way more sexy ... but sadly it seems less than 25 % of cars sold are manual these days ... at this rate they soon be extinct ... like the dinos ... ; -LRB-
get AUTOMATIC , but if you love speed and sporty get manual . .
automatic . hate the clutch . _________________ call me ONE .
HERE the reason why : :-RRB- http://www.metacafe.com/watch/72540/funny_commercials_mazda/
i would prefer manual may it be traffic jam or a long drive , you can do anything you want with the car hehehehe and i hope manual shift wo n't be extinct . = Dura Lex Sed Lex =
I 'm trying to find a triptronic unit for my KIA ... Any ideas ?? I googled , but could n't find one . .
Automatic/Tiptronic . Even when racing .
for city traffic auto , but for mountain and long roads manual for sure ! There is nothing more fun then driving manual on steep curvy roads :D <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> tra la la </p>
Automatic / Triptronic is as good as a manual when u really need the initial acceleration , If u have a good gear box which responds well . . It should n't matter if its automatic ur still gon na get the speed u require . With the traffic and roundabouts here there 's no way I 'll ever drive a manual car here !!! <spanÂ class=inlineÂ left> <imgÂ class=imageÂ previewÂ src=/files/images/coollogo_com_882831935.preview.gifÂ alt=Â width=237Â height=58Â /> </span>
Manual for offroad and Auto for city traffic . Peace .
A/T vs M/T : Automatic gives you more control over the steering wheel -LRB- when you are in the middle lane of a 3 Lane R/A -RRB- as you can use both hands . With Automatic also you can save fuel by going into neutral on straight stretches . You can also go into 1st Gear , 2nd Gear & 3rd Gear !!! -LRB- this is very useful while going uphill on a long mountainous terrain -RRB- . <b/> Thus you can use Automatic as a Manual car but not viceversa </b> And is there a Cruise Control for manual cars ? It has the most fuel savings advantage on long routes .
Automatic with INVECS Hi and LO :D that would be great !

SAP is easy enough , why does one need training in it . Just practice on any MIS software you can get your hands on .
YOu have to quite your job here and get some hands own experience , India is a good place with lot of opportunities to gain experience . Thanks
The most , expensive , useless , labour intensive piece of junk ever written . No one uses it as they should because it would take an army of technicians , engineers and accountants to fill every field and every step . So it gets used only in part . Ban SAP -LRB- Stuningly Atrocious Program -RRB-
SAP is n't to difficult to learn , but it needs concentration . Here 's this bit of news that is quite interesting . http://education.yahoo.net/articles/study_this_earn_that.htm?wid=1
That 's because the demand is high and the supply is quite marginal .
i know people in Qatar who are unable to get jobs , or even an interview call , and they are certified , with years of implementation experience . If you show patience and wait in India for at least sometime you could gain some experience and then come here .
I know a few guys who got SAP certification and went to Saudi Arabia -LRB- Aramco has the biggest SAP site around -RRB- or got jobs in USA / Europe . The key is getting your first job . Best thing to do is talk to Wipro or TCS and see if they can guarantee you a job after certification . Good Luck !

well i think if you want cheap AC filling then its in Al aziziya ... behind the aziziya compound ... he charges 150 ... and hes good in his work
You only need to fill the car aircon if it 's not working . The gas should not leak out in normal use , or disappear , or shrink . If your aircon has stopped working duev to a gas leak , you can re-fill it which may last a few weeks or so - but repairs are needed if your gas is gone . Should be about QR150 to fill - but it will quickly become cheaper to fix the leak .
Al mansoura , Fareh bin Dirham , is nearest place in Doha
Go to Shouq Al HAraag -LRB- NAjmaa -RRB- there is shop thay r saleing old ...
in Najma u can get all second hand items including Furniture
Go to Najma Market , behind Dasman near to Toyota tower .
Any name of the shops ?? Please .
Najma as they said but i think thier prices are high too
Eating out any where in Doha astronomical prices , some places u need to eat a sandwich will cost something like ten Qatar riyals -LRB- i.e + - 3 US $ -RRB- the person who sent the first reply to ur query has summed it up quite nicely and honestly here are some of his comment `` want to have a good time for less in the Mideast , go to Dubai , you 'll be spoiled for choice with bars , restaurants , shopping & activities to suit EVERY pocket ... '' ... ... . please give it a serious thought before u venture in for this expedition
I totally agree 100 % with what Garadene said , you hit the nail on the head with your comments . If your looking for a good time in this part of the world head to Dubai , its civalised with more variety , without the red tape to get into bars !!!
Contrary to popular belief , Doha does n't want ANY tourists . Ever . If you want to visit the Gulf and have a nice time , try visiting , umm , any place but Doha . Hotels are too expensive , there is nothing for tourists to do , and the authorities have created rules to ensure that tourists do n't have fun . Basically - tourists are n't wanted here . Go someplace else .
i advice u don come at all
I 've already actually been before but was asking for more advice as last time was n't much to do . I wanted to visit family over there but you have really put me off !!
sadly , I buy on ebay in the UK or US and ship via aramex . it 's expensive , but I have n't come across a decent component supplier here . If you find one , let me know .
As far as I know , She has to come back before the last day of 6th month .

I am not sure whether its still in practice or not ... you need to confirm it with the Airport Immigration Office . --------------------------------------------------------- Whenever I find the KEY to SUCCESS ...

KHATTAK ! ... I think the exit permit extention for another six months ' by making a payment of QR-500 / - is for students only !
if your leaving the country you need exit permit then they will stamp on your passport cancelled .
It depends ... if you are going for vacation then only exit permit is recquired and if you are leaving for good , exit permit is required , if you want to collect all ur dues you should cancell visa ... you can also leave without cancelling your RP ... If you have resigned and yur resignation is accepted by company , , they will cancell ur visa and get u exit permit . . if you are going on vacation and not intenteded to come back ... only exit permit is required and your RP will automaticaly cancelled if u do not turn up before 6months ... in all cases if your are leaving Qatar Exit permit is recauired ...
Thanks for ur quick reply , how much time will take for Visa Cancellation ?
Just the time your PRO reach immigration counter ... . u know it is just like a building a house is very difficult and breaking it takes matter of minutes ...
If you are leaving for good and you have plans to work in other GCC country then make sure they process your exit permit together with the cancellation paper . If you have plans to stay in your country for good , then exit permit is good to go .

Working in environmental health sort of ensures that I 'm not speaking from my derriere young squire ... I fear you may be speaking in a Jamaican accent -LRB- ` ting -RRB- ... Jamaica is also not known for its food hygiene ...
You think you have got full authority to comment on what evr thing you came across , well , I am not a Jamaican and mod has removed my word , but you look to me from some where around African Jungles . Do you know for example how many EHEC serotypes are there , and what is the mechanism they do Haemorrage ? ...
brit , the local cucumbers are much better than the european ones , anyway . A bit smaller , but size is n't everything : P
Size matters : - / lol
college girl to the fruit seller : why are the cucumbers small and soft today ?? fruit seller : why do n't you girls buy cucumbers to eat . . for a change .
but the cucumbers were not from Spain : -LRB-
I wonder if you can get infected if you leave the plastic covering on ?
Do not underestimate others , Qatar has highest food standard than any other EU or american countries , with almost 1000 's of samples are being analysed for chemicals , radiologicals and microbiological quality . So be sure that what you are eating is safe . Just make sure that you adopt good hiegenic practices before you eat 'em . Ciao
Errrmmmmm come again ? Qatar has the highest what ??? lol Qatar has the highest something or other but it sure as hell ai n't the highest food standards !!!
Do you know that , speaking shitt against some thing is very easy , I know and you will be on your nose like what germaney is now , So called EU nation with Microbiological ancesters like Koch 's and Loefflers . . ha ha
Indeed ... my sentiments exactly young squire ...
the saudi already stated that it does n't import vegetables from spain . what about qatar ? but first , is it the cumcumber ? last report i read had ruled out spanish cuncumbers , as the E.COLI found on them -LRB- yes they found E.Coli on spanish cuncumbers ! -RRB- are a different strend from the one causing the outbreak .
Zinx . * fingers crossed *
It is strain and not strend
yes . thx . and cucumber -LRB- not cun or cumcumber like french spelling -RRB- but strangely i ca n't find the edit botton !
Will you be doing without cucumbers for now ?
That 's what happens when you let the Spaniards handle the cucumbers ... they s h i t on them ... ; -RRB-
UAE is not allowing cucumbers from France , Germany and Spain without a test certificate .

all you mentioned in here sets me into tears :-LRB- sad to think i may be out there one time to pack my things and go ... the truth hurts :-LRB- tnx a lot !
switch job to some other middle eastern country , they all are tax free .
What is NOC ... i recently changed job by the knowledge of my sponser ... but my new company need NOC.Whats the format of NOC and does it apply for sponsership change.My existing visa is 6 months old.Pls advise .
since long time Americans are getting inspiration from their Hollywood , look at Rambo type movies , perhaps they need another episode to capture Osama and Taliban 's leader .
I do think films have an effect on some a lotta people in society . I did like `` The Blind Side '' , it is a beautiful film and I remember reading an article later about a few people being taken in by that movie and legally adopting afro-american kids like him . Nomerci is right about the action flicks and well as the chick-flicks . Rags to riches movies also do have an effect on the less fortunate who strive hard to complete their education and work harder to get noticed .
life itself is a movie .
depends on the kind of film ... definitely NOT bollywood , that 's for sure ... oh actually wait ... bollywood flicks do help change society ... for the worse , by turning people into morons ... like the ones on screen ... But if we look at foreign films , indie films , low budget non-mainstream films , true story renditions , etc. . . they would definitely have some sort of positive effect on society because more often than not , they 're based on & depict everyday reality , something that the audience can connect with ...
check the kids . . you will see it in them .
Yes , fims do play a pivotal role in our life . . I too agree to some extent that some portion or parts of the film do create impact on our daily lives and can even change the way of thinking and ideas of someone . .
it depends on how the viewer perceives the film
Films can be used to convey a message to the audience . Will we take heed of this message ?
brit - it deoends on how effectively the message was put across ... some messages hit the nail rite on the head while others take a subtle approach ...
Films indeed changed my life ... Watching movies like Basic Instinct - 1,2 has changed my life drastically ... : -LRB-
When CHAIYA CHAIYA song from Dil Se movie was shown I saw so many kids running and dancing on small toy trains , Than Daler Mehandi appeared with hi BOlo tarara and tutak tutak tutiyan ... by songs a list is long for Indian cinema becao we start dancing on the current tunes in the marriages and functions like Kajra rey Kajra rey or Beedi Jalai ley . . Than comes dresses of heroins or hero . . Than comes some dialogues ... MEIN HOON NA Than comes marriage stages or dresses or home designing concepts too . Yes society really moves not much but still a lot in Indian Cinema . .
I got confused , but what i think you 're saying that Bollywood influences how people dress . That 's fair enough . But what about sending out a moral/ethical/religious message . Do Bollywood films help you perhaps become a better person ?
All bollywood movies does is make girls yearn for hopelessly romantic never to be found in real life partners :--RRB- Movies have effect on one 's mood but nothing in long term I think as long as we are watching it knowing that its fiction .
amazingly , no one questioned this time my nationality from neighbours , why i like bollywood ;O -RRB-
Did you ever watch Gandhi or Dune ?
of course the mass media/movie production can change society . But i would n't use word `` help '' . `` help '' is something positive , while mass production can affect society very negatively . Movie can definitely form a certain images , pattern behavior , stereotypes , etc. . All Film companies reduce the number of smoking scenes in their films , some of them have banned these scenes completely . Movie creates stereotypes that are followed by people . Girls want to look , to be dressed and to behave as their favorite actress . Guys want to act like their hero acts . This is normal process . Brit , one separate movie might not help one individual become better -LRB- but also MIGHT help -RRB- , but creating a whole image of certain behavior and stereotypes in the society definitely can make this society better -LRB- or worse -RRB-

Try FFC Bakery they have Xmas Cakes , i guess you can place an order there .
Buy a good cake from a hotel , believe me it will cost you around Qr . 200 but it worth it & most you can enjoy , these FFC or Lulu bakery cakes will made as per their quality . -LRB- mallu -RRB- But in a hotel the cheff use the correct ingredients for their cakes to get the quality & taste . Actually there is no xmas as such , usually it is called as Rich cake and in addition to that in Europe you find a butter cake Pandoro or a different brand , you get those in Mega mart , Carrefour . Or you can buy a Yule log cake . so try with one of the hotels or Opera caf . Seasons greetings !

If turned over to a charitable organization or signed over to a tow yard , he might be in the clear . If it gets towed and it is sold at auction as part of a lien against the impound if the sale price comes up short , your fianc could very well be liable for the difference between the cost of the tow and storage and the auction income .
Contact qaws.org - they will be able to help you out .
Do you have a Plan in place to take the puppy home ? Please make sure you do . My self I have found my 2 amazing dogs from Qaws but I always intend to take them home.I see so many people rescue animals and then leave them behind which is not fair on the animal . A dog can live as long as 18 years and you have to answer the question . Can I commit that long to them ? If you can then go for it as dogs give you so much love :-RRB-
I would say QAWS too . We adopted one around 3 weeks ago from there , it was the day after the big fire and we have a great dog . Best not go to a pet shop as I have heard that they DO NOT look after the animals at all .
Defo QAWS . The fire has left so many dogs homeless and without the kindness of all the people who have fostered them they would be on the streets .
As all said , contact QAWs . Much better to adopt dog or puppy from there than buy from a pet shop . Then afterwards when you plan to leave Qatar commit yourself to also take your dog with you , and not leave it behind , struggling to survive and hungry .
The battery needs to be replaced .
Remove Battery from your Laptop & fix battery properly and try to charge again without ON the Laptop for a while . Hope it will work
Dear Friend , remove the battery from your Laptop & fix properly and try to charge without ON the laptop for a while . Hope this will work
it happens in all dell laptop
Did u turn on the switch after pluged ?
Dear Friend Rasheed , Thanks for your advice . I tried your advice but no success . . Why the Dell laptop having always Pblm . we faced another pblm -LRB- CD complaint -RRB- before with the same laptop . I need to suggest one thing to all my friends that if you are planning to buy a laptop , do n't search for dell ...
Original battery of Dell laptops cost 600 + QR . Original Charger cost 500 + QR . You can check at Sofitel if they have cheaper price . But I believe he problem is on the battery . Good luck !
Yeah this is a persistent problem with DELL laptops , especially the ones bought from the US . I bought 2 for my friends and they both had the same problem . One had to even replace his charger once , coz it stopped working . If you contact DELL support here , they will tell you to replace the motherboard or some tech jazz like that ... seek professional advice .
Hello , Please do the following steps : 1 -RRB- Remove the battery , check the ac adapter pin . Plug only ac adapter to the laptop and check if laptop powers on only on AC-Adapter . 2 -RRB- If laptop powers on using only AC adapter-shut down the system , plug in the battery . Go-To the BIOS by using F2 key while the system startup and check if the Adapter is listed in the BIOS -LRB- It will be listed as 60W/90W or according to the model of the adapter -RRB- . 3 -RRB- If the adapter is not listed in the BIOS , you can try updating the BIOS by downloading the latest BIOS updates from www.support.dell.com . While updating the BIOS ensure that both battery and AC adapter are plugged-in . 4 -RRB- If the problem persists , please replace the AC adapter . As it is 8 months old , it is under warranty . Best of Luck !
I had same problem with my HP notebook and after a few trips to the service center the problem persisted , they said its a software problem with Vista . After a lot of googling this is what worked for me : 1 . Click Start and type device in the search field , then select Device Manager . 2 . Expand the Batteries category . 3 . Under the Batteries category , right-click the Microsoft ACPI Compliant Control Method Battery listing , and select Uninstall . WARNING : Do not remove the Microsoft AC Adapter driver or any other ACPI compliant driver . 4 . On the Device Manager taskbar , click Scan for hardware changes . Alternately , select Action > Scan for hardware changes . Windows will scan your computer for hardware that does n't have drivers installed , and will install the drivers needed to manage your battery 's power . The notebook should now indicate that the battery is charging . ''
You can learn the basics from a friend who is a Muslim , I guess .
Oh ok ... no idea why that 's happening though . Hopefully the mods will sort it out cos I 'm really looking forward to hearing from you . Barakhallah feeki
I seriously doubt about SrK and Salman 's religions ! Just getting a birth in a muslim family does not make a person muslim , otherwise the son of Prophet Nuh -LRB- peace be on Him -RRB- would be a muslim . Everybody needs to strive for knowledge of Islam and implement the rules and discipline in their personal life .
Maybe bro maybe ... but how will knowing whether or not these stars are Muslims , benefit us ? In fact , May Allah protect us , by wasting time trying to find out about their place in Islam , we can commit bigger sins and even lose our Islam , due to our lack of knowledge on things that are far more pressing . But yes you are right , being born to a Muslim family does not make one a Muslim , and I know this firsthand , sadly , due to the state of my own family and who I was less than ten years back , Astaghfirullah !
buddy i say let 's all keep our houses in order and the rest will automatically fall in place . besides , it is not any person 's place to judge others and their standing in Allah 's sight . We do not know how Allah judges us . It is possible Salman Khan is more dear to God than you or me because of some small good deed he did sometime . If a 100 time murderer and a prostitute were forgiven and granted heaven for merely watering a thirsty dog , Salman stands a good chance too Allah willing . So yeah let 's all pray for each other and keep our own Islam strong : - -RRB-
you stated you were ' a certain way ten years back ' . i get your intention and am sure you do n't plan to anyway but please do not mention any more details of why or how you were a bad or lost muslim . the reason i say that is because people frequently curiously ask for more details . . and we in good faith spill all our beans . . but Allah frequently veils for us our sins from the world and people because he intends to forgive those sins . I too have been and still am a somewhat lost muslim but alhamdulillah god has shielded all those sins from people and inshallah it will only be between me and him . Thus we should not openly declare what allah has mercifully hidden for us . And I hope we are not hijacking the thread . . well we are but not really lol
Guess my intention of saying so was to specify more why I do n't judge people due to y' know . . But you are absolutely right , Jazakhallah khair for your advice . As always we are all in need of one another for advice and help . May Allah truly forgive us all , increase us in knowledge and grant us success in this world and the next . . Aameen And yes that was a hijack , but hopefully it will be viewed as a `` good '' one !
More distractions and love for this materialistic world snatch peace from our lives . Peace of mind and soul is not easily available . We all need to strive to attain spirituality and peace .

yes when the self proclaimed experts busy themselves with issuing ` fatwas ' against film stars and cricketers , the misguided extremism and strife inevitably follow . . do n't know where you 're from but the scholars in India are too pre-occupied with Salman Khan and Zaheer Khan to have any time to educate people on the true Islam .

But FYI the pumpkin crop this year was below expectations , so it 's been hard to find . I hoard it and always have 2-3 cans on hand . `` If you 're looking for sympathy , you 'll find it between sh * t and syphilis in the dictionary . '' - David Sedaris
I agree with boer buy a real pumpkin
and was told by staff that it is now all gone . Initial shipment only lasted about 3 days . They do expect another shipment next week . But that 's after Thanksgiving . I have never seen it at any other grocery store in Doha besides Megamart . If you really need to make pumpkin pie -LRB- and what would Thanksgiving be without one ! -RRB- then it really is quite easy to buy a whole pumpkin , cut it up and cook it down . There should be real pumpkins . I know they have them at Wholesale market and Megamart still . Check the internet for recipes/directions . Good luck .
i went to mega mart yesterday - they have loads on a stand by the checkouts
You have to stock up before October . Those danged Canucks have their Thanksgiving early and beat us Yanks out for all the canned pumpkin . I 've taken to breaking into their villas and `` liberating '' the pumpkin for a proper holiday ! Mandi

wow , , thats good I was expecting more money than that ... thanx
in Westbay area ? Of course , however the money you 'd be investing in buying your own furniture i think it should be worth it .
just thought it would be hard to find an uf place :-RRB- and if the prices are different , i might get a better place for cheaper with my own things - thanks !!!!
As I mentioned above have a look at the Pearl .
Thankie ! Will do UKEng !
haha - thanks Mary - I 'll try to get those things last minute here ...
My names Craig , MD of Mirage Properties here in Qatar . Regards your queries I can pretty much second what most others have said so far . If you 're a single person working in West Bay area then you 're better off finding an apartment in a good quality building near to work . Villa compounds here are usually geared towards family living as most are 4-5 bed + properties . However , saying that we have just released an apt compound , on Al Waab St , which would give the best of both worlds . Sadly for you , these have all been leased i 'm afraid . If you do opt for a Pearl Apt , or one of the better towers in the business district , you will usually get all the facilities you would find on a compound and be living with like minded people . When searching for property please be aware that there are 3 types of furnished basis here in Qatar : Unfurnished -LRB- U/F -RRB- - means you get nothing , not even kitchen appliances and sometimes no AC either , in very extreme cases and usually in older properties you do n't even get kitchen cabinets . Semi Furnished -LRB- S/F -RRB- - Kitchen appliances , A/C 's and sometimes curtains . Fully furnished -LRB- F/F -RRB- - Kitchen appliances , Furniture , Curtains , TV , DVD and sometimes bedding , kitchen utensils , crockery , cutlery etc -LRB- but not usual -RRB- . Price difference between S/F & F/F is usually around QR1 ,500 - QR3 ,000 extra per month .

OMG 140 km/h in a 80 km/h zone . Working in a Ministry and not respecting the laws ?? how come ?? Dude what was wrong with you ?? c'mon do n't you want to live ?? My guess is you will have a skyhigh penalty . Wait for metrash system to be updated and check it online Regards !!
Traffic law fines/points system Action : 7.-Driving a vehicle on the road recklessly or carelessly or in a way that endangers life of people and properties . Penalty Imprisonment of minimum one month and maximum 3 years and / or fine of minimum 10000 Riyals and maximum 50000 Riyals according to article no -LRB- 94 -RRB- . The punishment will be double by the minimum level in case of repeating the same violation according to article number -LRB- 98 -RRB- . Some more detail Action 38 . - Exceeding posted speed limit on the road . Penalty QR .500 ; And to be increased by QR .100 for every 10 km / hour of speed to the maximum penalty of QR .1000 .
You will have to wait a couple days for it to come up so you can check on moi.gov.qa , my guess is it is going to be a very high fine as you went very very over the speed limit . Need to drive safe .
Oooooooooo GOD , Thnx for your Responces . Me also waiting sms from Matresh .
rms since it is a mobile radar no need to flash ... it will record anyway . People be safe please !!
Yes its like a black colored small robot connected with car type battery . Now i went out and pass by the same road , they already removed the radar from their , according to one source these kinds of radars are works in night time only ... Thnx elioswd Have a great and save weekend , all of you .
It will take 2 working days to reach in ur mobile through the metrash ... but u have 2 face a fine of amount 600 , qr
sorry if ur jumb the signal , & over speed the fine is 6000qr & 6 points , any way take care bro ... ... . .
clearly you are way high on the speed limits , but thanks for sharing this , I really did not know that in qatar there was a mobile radar
The damn thing flashed for me too , and unluckily I was doing 82-83km / h. . have n't received an SMS yet but it 's gon na be a bugger to pay a fine for such less overspeeding -_-
I run the QL photo group and NEVER have trouble with rule # 3 - maybe you should look within your own groups for the answer to this one :o-RRB- I do n't believe it has anything to do with ethics . Some people are just destined to remain a.s.s.holes
flor . . isnt it the third post of yours on the subject ... I would suggest take them -LRB- whoever they are -RRB- headon by naming them right here right now & kill the issue for everyones good once for all instead of going around in circles or stop these posts every other day with different titles .
get them to one of the meet ups and we will use them as bowling balls ; - -RRB-
flor ... I didnt get what you mean by `` taken to the authorities '' ... anyways if you feel they dont understand ethics then whats the point in you being ethical by not naming them .
they are ladies that need our care . They just need a little reminder ! Lol ! Will you come tonight ?
i have been very gentle and kept telling you quit it means quit it enough is it hard for you to understand . If not then make sure i dont see you around next time .
What is exactly Community Guideline 3 ?
Hi Alan , you might wan na re look at the difference in intrest rates between a car loan approx 3.4 % as compared to approx 9 % for a personal loan . If you check with manager -LRB- not sales guy -RRB- of GMC they can get the car down from DXB for you . I hear the drive down is no fun either and not too safe too . Just curious why would you like to drive a manual car when you can go in for a triptronic instead . With the increase in traffic an auto is de way to go -LRB- just my oponion -RRB-
Mandilulur , ignore the profile , its nonsense . I refuse to post anything remotely truthful about myself on a public forum . My name is n't Alan either , but it 'll do for this forum :-RRB- B2D , driving is always fun , I love cars , always have . Plus its an adventure , never done it before :-RRB- Cy , I know about the rates , but the actual monthly payment costs are n't too different , yes I pay more overall , but I can accept that for the convenience it gives me in choosing the car I want . I 'm a Brit , I grew up driving manuals and its a more compelling experience than having an automatic decide when to change gear . I bought the car , I 'll decide when to change . Personal opinion on Triptronics is they are there for show , and they still are n't as good as a manual box . The wannabe Schumacher 's of this world can have them , I 'll stick with a standard 6 speed box thanks . Easier to hang the arse out of a RWD V8 when you can control the gearbox , not a sodding computer . : -RRB-
Xena , I picked that name because I used to wear glasses that reminded my work colleagues of him :-RRB- I think asking for a manual here is as shocking as asking for a bacon sandwich .
Maybe you could get the personal loan get the car and then switch to a car loan -LRB- for the lower rate ? -RRB- worth asking about - worst they can do is say no and you 're just back to where you are now
Ok got one last one in me , been here for 9 years now and have owned 4 cars here just bought my 5th - GMC Denali its an triptronic LOADS OF FUN TO DRIVE AROUND . As you all have mentioned the reaction that you get when u ask the sales guy for a manual , it is that much more difficult to sell a secound hand manual . Its much much easier -LRB- and gets you a better resale price -RRB- to sell an automatic if when you deside to sell for what ever reason .
Cy , fair point , well made :-RRB- But I still want a manual . More expats than locals in this country , so I do n't think it will be a massive problem come sale time .
LOL , totally see where you are coming from . BUT , the clincher for me is this ... ... . Auto 's are crap at Losail : -RRB-
take a personal loan for the amount needed for the car ... You can then have the money paid to your account and you can do with it what you like : - -RRB-
Xena , now that 's what I wanted clarification on . I know I ca n't take a car loan as it would be secured against the car , which is difficult when I have to go out of country for it . Sooooooo , it is possible to take a personal loan and get the car . Might have to investigate this a bit further :-RRB- Saeedkan , you 'll have to show me this trick of eating the wrong way . I thought there was only one way : -RRB-
at one stage I wanted to by a second hand car and the bank suggested that due to the interest rate being so high for second hand , about 12 % , why not take a personal loan at 8/9 % and pay for the car that way :--RRB- So yes , it can be done .
Rye To be honest , I would do something similar , but my parents live in Dubai , so I 'll just book it in for a service over there and go visit for the weekend . Drive down will be fun too . Xena , thanks for the info , all good to know .
Welcome to Doha , Yes there are mosques in the Hilal area and AL-Thumama area if you need directions please let me know .

Guys this is great ! I am looking forward to meeting other shiites when i get to Qatar ! Inshallah i 'll be moving there in May ! Thank you so much for responding and i 'll definetly keep in touch . Wallah you all put a big smile on my face : -RRB-
Hey can you please email me directions from Ramada junction to Hilal area , where the mosque is ? I have been googling it all over - and i havent had luck . Many thanks , AM
Hey , I just got in too , and I did go to the Urdu Majlis - but its very different . . -LRB- I think -RRB- . . Its right behind the Qatar National Library . I can email you directions if you want . The Iranian imambargahs are suppose to be the good ones , but apparently - I havent had any luck finding them . Let me know if you find any . Cheers , Abbas

Salam Alaikum . I would appreciate if you can let me know the directions of shia mosque in Doha . I have recently arrived in doha and does not know much about it .
I hate em . . they should be banned !
I see shiites on the roads every day !
calm down ... this was posted last year . . so you 're a little late in responding :-RRB- just wondered ! i didnt say i was shiite , i was just wondering if there were any in Qatar-Am i not allowed to wonder and ask ? thanks
dear all there is alot of shi3a in doha and more than you can imagine and big names also , so for the ones who ae making fun of religion no matter what is it are stupid as far as i can tell and have no dignity or brains . thanks and best regards
first you were asking about center to treat homosexuality in qatar , Now you are asking for mosques for Shiites ? why i feel that something is fishy here ?? not only wondering ??
nice to know about shiite community around here , i need the same info regarding shiite congregations ... can somebody tell me about imambargah , i m new here

I have an evidence . An email conversation as an evidence of borrowing money and the promise to pay .
Thank you for the response .
rimlaw ... so what is the safest way of transaction ? Since Cheques & Promissory notes are not enforceable .
Cheques and Promissory notes are admissible in evidence for civil cases such as Collection Cases for sum of money , Judicial Foreclosure of Mortgage , etc. but not for ciminal prosecution of estafa or deceit . While checks may have probative value to establish motive or intent it is not the quantum of proof to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt . Promissory Notes on the other hand will disprove estafa since this document will clearly establish a loan transaction . The safest way in transaction involving forebearance of money or exchange of goods for money is to have a contract or document that clearly specify the nature of transaction . Never get swayed by sweet talking persons and you might end up scammed .
Ministry Of Human Rights Somewhere in WestBay
What is Estafa ?
if Estafa is what MJ said , then what Human rights can do with that ? Honestly , I think nobody can do anything about it , unless there is a legal written contract of lending/borrowing money . Even in this case the procedure is way too long and you might end up with giving to the lawyers much more money than you are owed ... <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed . Antoine de Saint-Exupry </b> </i> <imgÂ src=http://cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif>
You have 3 options . You may lodged a complaint or blotter with any nearest police station . If he is a foreigner , the police will give him a visit together with your complaint . If the respondent will not own up , they can file your complaint with the prosecutors . If the respondent is Qatari , you go to the Ministry of Human Rights and they will assist you there . You may also try your embassy which normally have legal officers familiar with local criminal procedures to assist you . Good Luck .
Qatar criminal and civil procedures are unique in the entire gulf region . It has both the regular courts and the sharia courts . For estafa or deceit , it is normally filed with a complaint with the prosecutor and after preliminary investigation , it will be filed with the Court of First Instance . You need not hire a lawyer since the prosecutor will be your lawyer . But bear in mind to produce evidence on estafa or deceit . If you have no documentary exhibits forget your complaint and charge it to experience . Sharia courts handle family relations law and criminal cases involving Qataris and muslim litigants . Cases involving foreigners , civil or criminal are handled by regular courts .
Evidence is very important in criminal prosecution . Oral testimony will not prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt , the quantum of evidence required to convict an accused in a criminal prosecution . The rejoinder of qatarisun is well taken , your respondent can easily deny having received money from you or simply say that the money is simple loan , and you have no case for estafa . The essential element of estafa is `` trust '' and `` exchange of goods or money '' . Prove this both and you have a case for estafa .
the formality or informality of your document is immaterial . What is material for your case to prosper in ourt is the substance of your document . It must show the nature of your transaction , mentions the goods or money he received , his name and signature thereon , and any witnesses to the transaction . If you parted goods or money based on his representations , and which you awfully trusted , and his promise or acknowledgement of paying you back , and he reneged on this promise , then you have a criminal case for deceit or estafa .
there you have it , your reference to the word `` borrowed '' presuppose the existence of a simple loan , and your allegations for estafa is doomed . electronic mails or emails are now admissible in evidence in courts under certain qualifications . but what you have on hand is evidence of simple loan not estafa . in which case , if the amount involved is substantial , you are advised to seek a local lawyer to assist you in filing a simple case for sum of money and damages . Legal fees here are quite expensive , prepare with your deep wallet .
Ms J , promissory notes are not evidence of estafa but of loan . Promissory notes are ancillary documents to the principal contracts of loan . If one can not pay his loan , you do not sue him for estafa even if this is accompanied promissory notes and with rubber checks . Issuance of bounching checks are not punishable as a crime in Qatar if that is what you have in mind .
Lulu hyper on D-ring , there is an optician shop inside . That 's where I go .
any optical shop here can do it . . I had my first eye test in Pearle Opticians in Villaggio last year . . Then just last week , I had my lenses replaced , it was in the shop inside Carrefour , the guy was kind enough to give a discount . .
means 2years in Qatar and you still dont know where to do eye checkup . I will suggest a hammer whack back ofyour head and see if you still have a clear vision . seriously common . Try Ahli Hospital consultation fees is 300Qr . rest depends .
DR.Pushpalatha , opposite capital police station a/port road .
In Al Ahli hospital compound Megrabi clinic all spcialIist doctors for eyes and ears . Contact Information : Address : Ahmed Bin Ali Street , Wadi El-Sil Tel : -LRB- +974 -RRB- 4884000Fax : -LRB- +974 -RRB- 4870259
go to any optician you see on the road , choose the frame you want for your new glasses and they will have your eyes tested for free ... if you are suffering from irritation or any other eye disorder then only go for professional consultants like a proper clinic .
You can find them in Baby Shop . Good luck !
Try the usual place like mothercare , babyshop or toys r us . Also have a look at Mamas Papas in Villagio , just next to the canal .
try mamas and papas in villagio .

Well , usually the ideal way to use or hook up are the worms , but u jus cant find them in here , We use hardened wheat flour , Sardines Also , a fake small fish , with smell . u can buy them at the shops . i havent tried it yet , See your luck , and let us know wat u have caught ! I miss fishing at New york , Hudson river , Ontario Lake !
i think u can find in shops where selling fishing rod , hook etc. . because last time when i was byuing a fishing rod i saw there in bottles and i asked the shopkeeper and he told me this is worms using for fishing . the shops are located in somewhere in souq in between islamic meusium roundabout and clock roundabout . somewher same line with galaxy sports.ther are 2 or 3 shops ... io think
sparkle , it depends what and where you want to fish , I guess for sherry kalamari or squid works well , for baracuda sardine or mackarel , you can even try a lure , rapala sxr 14 is good for beach casting , for safi you can try wheat flour mix , shrimps is effective but doesnt work if you want to cast some distance , hope it helps and yes for most of the baits you should buy either from fish market or lulu . Tight lines .
I dont think there are places where u can get worms/baits/lures here ... for baits and lures , i guess its best to order online . . you can check out a whole list of options in the link below : http://www.fishinfo.com/resources/lures.htm

I must say company is good and under very good control of Mr. Anil Mahajan but it depends under what department you work but I say if you meet with the financial requirements and you are ok with your salary then atmosphere will be good and you will get things to learn .
Do they give NOC ? Do they keep your passport ? These are the questions to be answered .
do they give you good salary ? that is another question .
It is owned by the Qatar emir 's family . If I am you , I will do thorough research abt CGC . They have good clients , but delay timely Salary , How much did they offer you ? And whats ur designation ?
Only good thing is you will be provided with a free NOKIA mobile
the HR People attitude is very bad and unacceptable . so if you work that company you need to deal with HR . beware of thier HR . also i know they pay very low salary . and thats the only company pay that kind of very small salary in Qatar .
Do they keep the passport ? What if one needs to come back to India for any emergency ? Are there issues getting the passport back ?
The overall package offered in QAR 20k which includes everthing . . house , car , conveyance , telephone etc. . . not sure if this a decent package to survive .
which designation is offered to you ? 20K is a good salary in Qatar .
not a good company at all . sales incentives from showroom are not given on time . sometimes you have to beg for months and sometimes they do not give them at all . some male managers are perverts so ladies beware , i know a person who was sexually harassed by a manager sitting in muntaza ofc . really be careful . not a place for young and pretty ladies .
there 's many CGC companies , just give name therewith with full forms . but CGC is not so good
The talent acquisition team in CGC team is very unprofessional.The talent acquisition manager takes interviewees for a ride by promising family accomodations & visas for family , which does n't happen when you join the company .

Both the wife and I use Kindles here in Doha . The wireless obviously does not work , but you can download books to the PC easily and put them on the Kindle . Books are way cheaper this way and a much better selection than any store in Doha . I have no idea about Mac compatibility . I suggest you check out Amazon.com and find out .
Ditto what the first poster said . I have the Kindle , friends have the Sony Reader , and both work fine here in Doha . You just download to your computer and transfer over to the reader . Since you can basically use an iPhone like an electronic reader -LRB- I have another friend who does that here -RRB- , I suspect there should be no problem using them with either PC or Mac formats . But check online to be sure . Just my two cents : they are SO much better than books !!! Cheaper to buy individual texts , much easier to travel with ... I got tired of waiting for a decent bookstore to come to this country . It never will . So cut out the middle man and just do it this way . Only wish I had gotten mine sooner !
I need to figure out how to download books and move them over manually . Have any of you figured out how to do newspapers ? I 'd love to get the international herald tribune back ...
I have ebook reader if u want , i can sell it for u my number 5239986
Mr. Claudio I am intrested in buying your kindle tell me the price and contact info please ? <!--break-->
Hi check with HOME CENTER
I saw some at the 2nd floor of Dasman , Airport road
Thanks guys . Will be sure to go and have a look . Otherwise I must pull out my sewing machine and do it myself .
Hi Visper are you still in the Phil ? My love for Indian mangoes disappear when I tasted the small pineapple in Tagaytay . Cheer up . Everything happens with a purpose .
You can try sending a mail to the moderators but you need `` wasta '' to get the account deleted , I have only seen personal friends of the Mods getting their account deleted . I have been trying it for a long time but they are n't deleting mine . Come to think of it , Ahmad , Reminder No. 3 .
make another account and tell mods you have multiple ID , or place one mobile number in both profile accounts and presto , both accounts will be deleted ... : -RRB-
Visper dear , is everything OK with you ??
is there a way u can rename ur account atleast ??
There is , send a request to the Mods with a recommendation from one of Mod 's friends . I asked him to rename it too , still waiting for that without any recommendations .
you can check out anytime you like ... but you can never leave ... -LRB- not so serious answer sorry -RRB-
huh ? some kind of Hotel California ... ?
ok thanks . .
visper , where is ur profile picture ??? And y so sudden u thought of deactivating ur profile from QL ??

They have seafood restaurant out at sea side.very romantic .
Il Teatro -LRB- Italian -RRB- restaraunt in the Four Seasons . It would be a very romantic spot . If you make reservations tell them it is for an anniversary and they will do something special for you .
29 is nice for a great steak , good service and nice atmosphere ... 29th floor Beverly Hills Tower across from City Centre Mall . Have fun wherever you go ! <imgÂ src=http://www.kandjsupplies.com/animations/pics/animal_camel.gifÂ /> Sybil
I like the Spice Market at the W for a special dinner . Mandi
Do n't just pick any hotel restuarant - a lot are not what you 'd class as romantic . I 'd say nothing at the Intercon is romantic . Spice Market at W might be ok , but they have to many staff staring at you all night . The fish place at Sharq is good .
at W or mebbe even the Penthouse - Al Mandaloun at Alfardan Tower
its fine . . guess u wouldnt require license too
yes ... but with a valid driving license ...
i just saw yesterday with my wife it is remarkable and has a lot of massages , it shows the purity of our mother land and the movie is dropping its story on our reality . in addition the philosophy of color there is incredible . bottom line you should go and give it a try enjoy it :-RRB-
yea i saw the movie its worth watching , it has a message and the effects r well done.worth ur time , must see .
Its a definite must watch ... and a must watch in the imax theater at Villagio ... incredible cinematic experience and inspite of the mind blowing cinematic effects , it does n't take anything away from the story line ... it all blends ...
i just finished watching it now ... it was awesome . . i felt bad for watching it here in my home ... : D
Awesome !! 10/10
Stupendous performance by all and an excellent movie . . MUST WATCH !!!!
Good movie . Watch in IMAX Villaggio
Fantastic movie . Must watch in Imax 3D . You feel as if you are in a different world .

you can come back anytime ... under visit or business visa . if you can get NOC ... then u can work too ... apply for your visa then u will see if you will be denied ...
Not at all ... better stay there ...
ask your sponsor .
DEFINITELY NOT .
I know two agencies who can provide you with models . its trinity and behip , you can find them on facebook .
hmmmm ... Ukeng seems interested .
mariecor . . At my age . . I guess I am interested in any thing and every thing . . :-RRB- always wanted to do Modelling . . :-RRB-
Although your profile shows you are not a newbie . Do n't you know what kind of reply you will get to this .
Wish it was me :-LRB-
I think those loans up to a certain amount are insured with the Insurance companies and banks will get their money back from the Insurance .
Sorry , I forgot to ask . Why you are interested in such an issue ? Is it only curiosity ?
If you leave Qatar without paying your personal loan , definitely a case will be filed against you then you will be blacklisted in the immigration . You should never visit Qatar again or else you 'll land in the prison cell . Yes , personal loans are insured but bank ca n't recover it thru default or non payment . Insurance is for life only , meaning applicable only if the borrower died .
there are banks here that is also available in your country even if you will not come back they have authorize agencies to confiscate whatever you have in your country
First of all such acts is non recommendable , by the way all banks are having very strong networks all over the world , they will trace the person out whereever he is , then u can imagine what they will do , and secondly within middle east they will black list the person and they will make the persons life miserable .
bank or any lending institutions extend such lending to you specially expats on the merit of your integrity thru your sponsor sometimes . they granted loans even they do not know you 100 % , and you should be thankful to such lending institutions . the first thing you should do is to go to the bank and settle everything or else you will be facing many consequences in the event you run away from such responsibility . there is a saying that says good karma begets good karma.bad karma will likewise begets bad karma . think about this .
What will Happen if the compani is terminating ???
Carrefour , Jarir Bookstore , PC One , Sofitel Area Many choices to select from ... just visit , check for specs & prices and make a choice . Regards !!
I was very happy with PC One on Salwa Road . I did n't need any service sofar , but expect you will get the normal company service .
I bought my laptop from Jarir , after 8 mths the adaptor wont charge . I lost the receipt , then i brought it to Jarir service centre , they checked the series number and replace the adaptor with the new one no question asked and no charge as well .
PC one , Jarir book store , Villagio
Jarir book store and across the road offce one , PC one , city center there are many .
if u are giving more importance to after sales service then i would recommend you to go to `` PCOne '' in salwa road cause they have in-house service center , which is not only for warranty but also for any other IT related work such as connection problems , driver problems etc . . just visit them and see Good luck with ur new PC : -RRB-
Can check at EMax Electronics . They have opened one more showroom at Al Rayyan near Family food center . It is having the best display of products , good collection also .
I shall recommend you `` TECHNIC COMPUTERS '' they are doing ASUS LAPTOPS with service , you can contact them at +974Â 4501313 ... hope this will help you : -RRB-
ok all , , , , but u can type some prices here , , , because this companies do n't have a web site to check online the prices ... thanks ...
One more update . . ------------------- Please be careful if you are buying from Jarir , coz since they have installment system , they are seeling around 20 % than the market price to compensiate their interest . and they follow the same price even if u buy for cash . so please compare price with other shops before you buy it ... Hope this helps : -RRB-
PCOne and Jarir , they are very easy to talk to regarding after sales .

Hello dear friend , Am an engineer , according to me second employee can not give you employment as you are on sponsorship of first employer.so , you have to take N.O.C from first employer ...
Drac how about Head of N.O.C holder ... : -RRB-
I replied to your `` Question '' , it 's useless to cross-post here . A sponsor can do whatever they want .
mohamood , maybe you should ask those parents that have children in that school instead of posting it on QL .
mohamood , sorry you are worried about that school , but as I said , maybe you should speak to parents that actually have kids studying there , you may be able to meet them AT the school ...
My two kids are studing in the BFPS . There was good experienced teachers in BFPS . After She assigned duties , she terminated lot of teachers those who are familier with parents and students . She recruted new teachers those who are not familier with lots of students . This is not discriminate a person . Board of directers should know these things to be get a Bright Future for our kids . Parents and pakistan community should know these things .
YES SHE DONT ALLOW ABAYA . ... YOU HAVE TO USE BLACK GOWN ... WHICH NOT COVER YOUR BODY LIKE ABAYA ... BUT THIS ALSO NOT CORRECT TO REMOVE ABAYA BY FORCE ...
It depends upon the beholders : <b> A teacher 's gown is something loose and capable to cover-up the body

Sorry forgot the name ... its just near British Airways , KLM etc. ... opposite Sanna which leads to continental Hotel ... I Airfreighted everything . Did the packaging myself .

There is something however you should know which is wrap things well ... unfortunately ppl in Qatar donn ' t have that much of respect for ppls belonging ... If you see what I mean .

Always in transit .

Its a very genuine and interesting question.Please respond seriously , if some one knows . don take everything as fun .
The reason birds migrate is that they are avoiding the cold weather brewing in the place they are staying so they move to warmer countries . There is a possibility they are just `` passing through '' Doha when you noticed them . Scientifically , birds can travel thousands of miles so it 's possible Doha is not their final stop . They might have headed towards Iran or beyond ... Once they know that the weather in their place has warmed up , they go back .
I have heard , birds seen on Dubai Terminal , trying hard to caught up their Next flight , therefore , Security officers objected them lol , to proceed , Guess what , lol no transit Visa lol ,
JuliaRose , if u happen to look carefully , the birds are coming from Iran -LRB- the North Side -RRB- where the weather is more cold are going South to warmer / Tropical Climates . There are two types of Migration : long-distance migration , & short-distance migration . As per my knowledge , some short-distance migrating birds stay in warmer regions of Saudi Arabia along the red sea coast ; whereas some more species travel to Egypt , Sudan and farther to Ethiopia . For long-distance migration , birds fly as far as South Africa too . More information can be found on WIKIPEDIA .
So , whats the answer ?

There is no rules in Qatar for the air ticket and stuffs . It will depend on the offer they provide to you . i mean what offer they mentioned in your labour contract . So as baldrick2dogs said , u can either cash out economy class fair or fly using a business class . simple !
I would suggest take the Business Class travel offer much better . . ----------------- HE WHO DARES WINS
IATA fair is 50 % + more than the normal fair , if my calculation is not wrong .
yv2r Baldrick has replied very correct , if you want your company to issue a ticket , it will be Business class or if you want to encash the ticket money you will get only Economy fare . All Airlines are approved by IATA , means International Air Transport Association , agents who have IATA approval will follow rules and regulations , there are many agents who dosent have this IATA , they give less price means , to survive in competitve market they share their comission what they get from IATA agent with the passenger.Dealing with approved IATA agent is always beter .

I see it 's a tiny place Qatar . All the fun is illegal but it goes on , mainly the Arabs have a network in Abu Dhabi who bring in ladies just for that , Chinese seems to be the trade now . In Abu Dhabi it 's nicknamed the `` Chinese Takeaway '' , I suppose it 's rife in Doha too as they circulate I suspect ?
I can help u out in Cairo if you want ... I know it can be a bit overbearing but there is a nice vibe to it if you can get through all the grit and grime . If you are still open to the idea why do n't u tell me what you want to do in your remaining time there and I could possibly give u some suggestions ...
Lets say must of the young people go there including singles . but U must be aware of something on thursdays and somedays there is a rule in Qatar Couples only , so u must go to those places before 9pm . U will find a lot of people from all over the world , once u met one u will start to met more people . -LRB- Normal Socializing in anywhere of the world -RRB- If am here when u arrive I will try to show u Doha .

Leave me Alone ... :-LRB- Help the above guy , you moron !
saeed im not sure if getting the cute nurses seems impossible or his baldness treatment is a dead end :P
great jaredboy . . you got the perfect answer !
Saeed , this moron -LRB- asdqweqwezxc -RRB- is always thinking of hijacking the threads . Is there any treatment in QL for this disease ?
Try KFC in salwa road .
whats a chicken skin on a human ?
Chicken skin is not good for Health . I lub breast piece ... : -RRB-
lakes btw there is no cure for KP -LRB- keratosis pilaris -RRB- or chicken skin as we know it . . thus there are treatments but the results vary and can be disappointing coz this disease is chronic/genetic
ohh i thought he/she is talking about chicken skin and its body parts !! :-LRB- Many good specialists are there . Try visit Doha Clinic skin specialist . . they also have nice ones ...
rizks nice ones or you mean good ones ? : P
TFS . . will keep an eye on that brand the next time I buy !
I had this problem with Stanley 's boxed wine ... Then i switched to Jacob 's Creek : -RRB-
I just feel that a whole box -LRB- QR136 -RRB- is too much not to bring back and complain about , so am wondering if anyone else has had a similar situation and brought stuff back to QDC .
Take it back and demand a refund or replacement - you would if you were at home , why should it be any different in Qatar .
maybe bad spirits in the wine ... lol maybe the good spirits just died ... lol
Or use as Vinegar
No harm in taking it back even if you do not hear someone did or not . At the most they may not take it back though the probability of it seems quite low . And if you do , do not forget to mention your experience here .
around !
Equal to 6 bottles but in a bag inside a box so no glass .
Another reason not to shop at QDC .
That is came in a `` box '' should be your first clue that you may have made a bad selection .
I had a box of wine which went off . Unfortunately the pressure in the box started building up so I had to pour it away before the thing burst . By this time it was undrinkable , although I tried to drink it . I did n't think QDC would have believed me if I had turned up with an empty box claiming my money back .
What does `` gone off '' means ?
Sorry , i wanted to say technical visa.Visa on which profession is technical .
salary depends
What should be the minimum salary for sponsaring the family
What is your question ? you mean the person whom you wanted to sponser is a technical or you want a technical visa . If the person is your blood relative like brother or sister it dosent matter weather their profession in Passport is technical or non technical .

Hi ! One of their representative visit our office way back Oct. of 2010 and informe us that they will open 1st quarter of 2011 somewhere in West Bay . But unfortunately until now , we can not see any signs of IKEA . Love to buy kitchenwares and furnitures there too ...
Ask the Local owner of HOme Centre and HOmes are us . . they will be able to tell you lol
It is still under construction and it will take time to be commissioned . Hopefully they meet the target date of 1st Quarter of 2013 .

You sure mandi ? what about insurance , am i covered if i have accident , thought i was alowedto work for month before i had to leave and return again
You 100 % on that , not even for a month
Do you mean you came in on a tourist/visitor 's visa and are now in the process of obtaining a work visa/residency permit ? Your visitor 's visa is good for 30 days , renewable once , as a UK citizen . Your employer must have started your RP work within 7 days of your arrival . Mandi
no visit visa , working and after month got to leave for few days then returne
is it possible to get job on visit visa , for job whom to contact for job
Bye bye
Nope , completely illegal . Your employer should have gotten you a business visit visa . It allows for working in Qatar on a temporary basis . Mandi
to work on a visit visa , not for money and not even for free . Otherwise you must apply for a business visa .
to have Business visa , and/or on Arrival visa these are the only 2 visas allows you to work in Qatar . and by the way these 2 visas are extendable , Business Visa you can extended for another 2 months , and the On Arrival visa you can extended for another one month .
Cheers for imput , now where is the best hotel for brunch on friday ?
Mohammad Jabr , Visa on arrival is a TOURIST visa by its nature , with only difference that for the certain nationalities this tourist visa is available at the airport upon arrival , without applying in advance in their coutries . But it is still TOURIST visa , and therefore it is illegal to work on the type of visa . . The only legal work visa for the short-term employment/consultancy / internatioanl companies meetings and worksops , etc. is a BUSINESS visa .
within 10 working days they will call you for sure , b4 they come . be there to receive the technician !!
according to Qtel it will take at least 7 working days . . but in our case . . it took 10 working days due to line problem ...
for Qtel issues , we know who to turn to ...
Thanks saeedhan , I do wish to eep my old number so let 's hope you are right about the 3 days . My problem is that I do not know the Qtel number of the new house and I think I need to give that information to Qtel in order to apply for the transfer ? Sigh : -RRB-
Thanks saeed ... it is a villa and there is no such plate outside the door ... I guess I will have plenty of time to look for it when I move in tomorrow and no internet to distract me from the task ... One more question ... I have a package including internet , landline and movile line ... will they disconnect my mobile line at all during the process or only the internet and landline . Thanks :-RRB-
Qtel branches in Landmark and in City Center are open from 10AM-10PM from Sat-Thu and from 4PM-10PM on Fridays . Your husband works until 10PM 7 days a week ?
Wow , I just read the end of this thread as I just got my internet connection back after 2 weeks . Wow Ichwill what an unhelpful and negative comment !!! Qtel SMSed the reference number and appointment date ... nearly a week after we applied to move the line -LRB- AT THE MAIN QTEL OFFICE by te way -RRB- . Phew ! But then , they did n't turn up on the appointment date . When I called to complain they said they had called and we did n't pick up , but no missed calls on either of our phones . We were issued with another date a week after the initial date -LRB- today -RRB- and thank goodness they turned up this time and my line is working again . I guess 2 weeks without a connection is n't that bad , I actually expected worse .
3 days ???? yeah right ... 10 days on average but there is a way to get it done faster ... Let 's hope the great one reads your thread ;-RRB- There is a a great guy on QL who can solve your problem immediately but I wonder whether he will be online today ...
spicymum , no , 20 calendar days . Depends on which neighborhood you are moving to . Some areas are `` easier '' for Q-tel than others . I moved to Gharrafa 2 years ago and it took them 6 weeks to hook up my phone line and internet . When I moved to Al-Sadd it took them 10 days .
it 's not about what you know , it 's about who you know ...
it is called wasta ...
For me an asian here 's what I have done - First fill up a work permit form from labor office -LRB- you can go to the office or from the web -RRB- fill it up in arabic and complete all the requirements listed at the back page -LRB- except the police clearance -RRB- - bring the completed work permit form with attachments to labor office and they will give you a schedule/endorsement letter for police clearance -LRB- they will not take your completed form or monetary payment unless you have the result of your police clearance -RRB- - after a week when you have the endorsement letter from labor office you have to go to Police Clearing Office at Salwa , fill up police clearance form with requirements listed at the back , you could wait for a week or two for the result . - lastly you have to go back to labor office with your 1 . Completed work permit form with all the attachments -LRB- listed at the back -RRB- 2 . Result of your police clearance 3 . Payment and in the same day they will provide you with your work permit ID or you can ask the company 's mandoop to do that for you -LRB- a lot easy :--RRB- -RRB-
ok thanx alot for the reply.i dont want to work illegally . So i just have to get my father to type up a no objection letter and give it to my employer ? thanx in advance
- Work Permit QAR500 - Stamping your contract with english arabic translation QAR 30 - Police clearance + / - QAR50 -LRB- I forgot , sorry -RRB- - spending on sending and receiving , to and from your country attested document copy -LRB- listed at the back
If you are under your fathers Sponsorship then you do n't need to change your Sponsorship , You only need a No Objection letter from your father allowing you to work . If you say you have a job lined up then your future Employer will have to arrange the Job contract and have it endorsed my the Ministry of Labour
The government of Qatar does not have income tax . Your gross salary = your net salary . However , if your country has a tax treaty with Qatar you may be liable for taxes in your home country . You can research this by googling this on the internet .
Thanks folks . I appreciate the info
I come from a similar country , where every penny are earn is taxed . Thank God , Qatar is not like that . Your salary is tax free mate !
Lol I 've got a feeling we come from the same Country . God save the Queen ?

Hi there Salam Plaza will be the only one having these . You will need to go to the branch opposite city center . They stock all Nikon and Canon Pro cameras as well as lenses and accessories . They even have the new EOS 5D MK II !!!!! Good Luck
I asked them the price of 1ds mark iii before . . i cost around 32k whereas in ebay or somewhere else , it only cost u around 25-36k . .
if you are a serious buyer i can get it for you . right now 'm in virginia , states .
If he is going to spend around 32k , perhaps he is better off getting the new Nikon D3x . It is in many respects more advanced -LRB- the canon has been out for a while -RRB- in terms of technology moving forward quickly . The only limitation is its high ISO performance , perhaps limited and not as good as the D3 . By the way , what cameras are you guys using ? and lenses ? and ... .
canon 28-135 mm canon 100mm usm macro and sony H9
Buy it elsewhere ! Only Salam have them ... 5D2 is QR13000 in Salam or QR9000 in USA/Malaysia/Singapore / UK , etc. ... <aÂ href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3262305312/Â title=MonotoneÂ MIAÂ byÂ baldrick2dogs,Â onÂ Flickr> <imgÂ src=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3389/3262305312_f781590578_m.jpgÂ width=240Â height=97Â alt=MonotoneÂ MIAÂ /> </a>

Hi ! i need a camera like that because im a photojournalist , and im working for a newspaper . im covering a lot of events , and i need a `` top of the line '' camera . And no , im not yet in Qatar , im be there soon , thats why im asking for help , i wanted to buy a new camera there , specifically a Canon EOS 1D Mark III 10.1 MP Digital SLR Camera -LRB- Body Only -RRB- . Even when i know everyone says its more expensive there , any help is welcome !
Well photographer , the prices were mentioned in the earlier posts , now you make up your mind as to if you want to get it from outside or from here .
Top of the line Camera from Canon is 1Ds MkIII - I think not available in Salam - The available camera is 1D MKIII -LRB- without `` s '' -RRB- and it cost around QR20 . Or top ot the line from Nikon D3X -LRB- also not seen in Salam -RRB- - the available is D3 -LRB- without `` X '' -RRB- with almost similar price with Canon 1D MkIII . It 's depend on your lens you have now - if you have Canon lens then you should buy Canon body . I do not know what kind of journalist are you - sport journalist or indoor journalist . For sport definitely Nikon is the best , but for indoor Canon much better . . But why did you buy G10 ? it is not for journalist -- I use G10 only for travelling - for documentation / photography I use my DSLR . .
Hi guys ! thanks for writting . well , somebody told me that i could get a mark 2 or 3 in a good price there in doha , buy i wasnt sure . now , reading your comments , and some stuffs in the web , i think its not such a good idea , its better to buy the mark 2/3 camera somewhere else , everyone says its too expensive there . but i will keep an eye open in my visit to doha , but fater all the comments ive been reading , my expectations are very low man !
Hi ! the problem - from my point of view - is not getting one of those models there in doha , the thing is getting one in a good price . it seems to me that the prices for those models are very high there , thats why im saying im going there with very low expectations .
BTW , I went there yesterday for a small part -LRB- which was cheap ! -RRB- . The salesman told me that all the prices have increased 30 % !!!!!! <aÂ href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3262305312/Â title=MonotoneÂ MIAÂ byÂ baldrick2dogs,Â onÂ Flickr> <imgÂ src=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3389/3262305312_f781590578_m.jpgÂ width=240Â height=97Â alt=MonotoneÂ MIAÂ /> </a>
Can you give us more details . What was the part ? How much was it before and how much is it now ?
Prices for 5D2 -LRB- pro camera -RRB- - see my post higher up the page ... 50 % more than the rest of the world ! I 'd imagine the 1D will be the same ratio . Part was a new focus screen . The previous one got scratched by my blower trying to get dust off it . It is REALLY soft plastic :O -LRB- Cost QR120 fitted . Cost in Singapore was QR100 ... but out of stock ! <aÂ href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3262305312/Â title=MonotoneÂ MIAÂ byÂ baldrick2dogs,Â onÂ Flickr> <imgÂ src=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3389/3262305312_f781590578_m.jpgÂ width=240Â height=97Â alt=MonotoneÂ MIAÂ /> </a>
Hi photographer . Yes the 5D MK II is 13,000 Riyals body only . I priced it myself a few weeks ago . I do n't know about the MK III , but I imagine around 20,000 . By the way , are you in Qatar ?

Any neighborhoods in particular that are similar ? Thanks for you help !

Go for HP ... best value for money
There are lots of online reviews of the netbooks you mention , most of which speak highly of the Samsung , Acer Aspire One and HP mini . With these netbooks your personal preference of keyboard size , screen size , touchpad layout and battery life are more important than the processor speed , as they pretty much all use the same Atom processor now . I recently bought the HP mini 2140 from LuLu Centre for QAR 1388 , and I am very happy with it . It costs between US$ 450 to $ 550 online , so it seems like a good buy . Note that the LuLu one only has the 3 cell battery , which lasts around 2.5 hrs , vs the 6 cell battery with 5 hrs or more . The 6 cell battery can be purchased online for around QAR200 if you need to use it for long periods without a power socket . A friend has three different netbooks and likes the Samsung best . Unfortunately for him , it had a heat failure and has been returned for repair . I also like the look of the Aspire One and the Toshiba , as they have slightly taller screens -LRB- 1024x600 Vs 1024x576 on the HP -RRB- , and square touchpad . On the weekend I saw them at Jarir Bookstore -LRB- opposite Ramada -RRB- with 6 cell batteries for QAR1499 . I am thinking of getting one of these to try along side the 2140 , but just ca n't really justify having two . Most likely your decision will come down to which one you think looks best , after all , they 're more of an accessory than a computer . They also come in red , with flowers , so get the right one , or you will have to buy a new handbag and pair of shoes ! Jason
I 'd take an HP over an Acer any day . They seem so slow . Mine was so slow I gave it away to my two neices for xmas and bought a ` real ' laptop . <aÂ href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3615935822/Â title=TheÂ PearlÂ DevelopmentÂ PanoramaÂ byÂ baldrick2dogs,Â onÂ Flickr> < img src = `` http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3351/3615935822_2ca87f726f_m.jpg '' width = `` 240 '' height = `` 57 '' alt = `` The Pearl Development Panor
most of the major brands of laptops these days are good , especially the ones you mentioned . i have tried , toshiba , hp , lg until i switched to mac . acer is now the number 2 laptop maker in terms of sale -LRB- just saw it on cnn last night -RRB- . maybe you could give it a try .
You ca n't get a MAC for 1.500 QR !
I guess only ACER sells for 1500 . rest all are around 1800 - 2000 - 2500 range . I even read ACER has one for around QR1000 . Its obvious the resellers dont want to push the lower priced ones as it gives them lower margin . eg 10 % on 2000 = 200 -LRB- which is at least something -RRB- 10 % on 1000 = 100 -LRB- almost nothing -RRB-
you can get fujitsu siemens for QR1500 . Aana free , jaana free , Pakde gaye tho khana free .
or HP mini QR1399 . Aana free , jaana free , Pakde gaye tho khana free .
Powers I want to have : 1 -RRB- Spiderman 's senses to warn me of my boss 's coming near me especially when I write to QL . 2 -RRB- The Hulk 's strength to move my furniture around . 3 -RRB- Teleportation ability move from Matar Qadeem to Al Saad in a sec especially when I oversleep . 4 -RRB- Superman 's x-ray vision to check up on some things . 5 -RRB- Mr. Fantastic 's elastic powers so I can transform some of my body parts into various shapes and sizes .

you think the offer is low ? then forget it and look elsewhere . But , If you do n't have any higher offers yet , and has nothing to do with your time , why do n't you give it a try . ... listen to the sound of silence ...
whats the position , and what 's your nationality . pay is based on your race here . 3000 per month is a ridiculously low salary considering what the cost of living is . you 'd probably be living in a shack and be treated like dirt . shameful people offer such low salaries in a country with the highest per capita in the world .
it depends on which position , , the questions in this forum is always incomplete , and the guys wanted us the readers to guess and reply !!!! if the job offer is for a Officeboy / Peon , the salary is good !!!! if you have no job at hand and really in desperate mood , the salary is good !!!!
es , no need to bomb us , we have the planes , troops , and tanks here .
That 's how it works here , you can try to find a job in Qatar and the company will take care of all of your documents -LRB- RP , family visa , etc. -RRB- .
Great ! Thank you ... Now , how do I go about obtaining one ?
Find yourself a job in Qatar . . you will automatically get a work Visa . <aÂ href=http://photobucket.com/images/funnyÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg12/N-A-T-A-S-J-A/Funny/smile.gifÂ border=0Â alt=smileÂ Pictures,Â ImagesÂ andÂ Photos/> </a>
Work visas are linked to a job in a Qatari company . You ca n't GET one . Your employer would supply it .
Step 2 : The employer will take care of the visa . Make sure they arrange for your family to come to .
All , Thank you for the insightful responses . I 'm an operations Manager in the FMCG industry the U.S and have 5 + years of management experience in the fields of supply chain , logistics and warehouseing . Are there any good recruiting agencies , which I can utilize to help guide my search ? Contact information ? Websites ? Thank you again for your help .
I do n't mean to be discouraging to you by any stretch but most people do n't just up and relocate to Qatar . We are brought by specific companies for certain positions . That 's why Westerners can be paid a considerable amount of money - they were recruited and hired from overseas because of a very particular set of skills/experience needed by a firm in Qatar . When our contracts are over we will , nay MUST , however sadly return to our home countries . It is not a free-market economy . There are some generic recruiting agencies but your best bet is directly with a company that needs your specialized skill or a headhunter acting on that company 's behalf . If you have n't a skill that is in high demand -LRB- i.e. transplant surgeon -RRB- you will be competing for jobs with people from closer countries which traditionally tend to underbid their services .

http://www.gulftalent.com/home/index.php http://www.keyresourcesinc.com/ another couple of known agencies around Middle East and they do respond to your applications , I recommend it to some of my friends and they are lucky enough to find a job from them . I used to know a lot of this agencies but I changed computer , I could n't find them again . but will look for it in a next couple of days or so . Cheers ! <pÂ align=center> <aÂ href=http://www.wilsoninfo.comÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://i213.photobucket.com/albums/cc229/wil5037/tweety.gifÂ border=0Â alt=FreeÂ Clipart> </a> </p> Have a nice day !
Nisri , do n't get discouraged . It does take a while for alot of professionals to find a position when they do not already have a contact or a company recruiting them ... just as other posters said . You might take a look at this site - http://www.bayt.com/ Also , try to focus in on specific companies that you are interested in and apply directly . Good luck .
Please check your inbox i sent the name of the company & its web add for you to be able to apply online . i heard they are looking for the position you have just mentioned . Ciao !
What is your profession on your RP ?
It is very easy to get a E Visa . Just go to Google and enter Visa for Baherin and you will go to the site and you can get the visa sitting at your desk . The authorities are very cooperative and help tourist . How i wish Qatar had such open policy for tourist who can come for 1 or 2 weeks to meet friends and relatives
I believe , irrespective of the profession in RP , your RP Should be vlaid for minimum 6 months for you to get a visa on arrival to any other GCC countries . I do not want to confirm it , but this is what I heard . BTW , I would advice you to talk to the Bahraini Embassy here in Doha before planning your trip . - SAK
GCC nations need atleast remaining 6 months valid visa , but sometimes there is excuses , on arrival visa is avialble for professionals .
Hi you can apply online for Bharain Visa . The web site is http://www.evisa.gov.bh/ . They will confirm the once approved . Apply well before one week .
bleeeez ... good one arien . Both colt .
I would vastly prefer that captkhan NOT put his head between his knees if he loses an engine on take off . I lost one out of SFO and am here to tell the tale . Mandi
Thanx to the almighty i have n't had such a incident yet .
Mandi , I lost a good friend to the GF flight that landed in the drink due to a pilot thinking that would be a good time to pray instead of ACT !
Be prepared to answer some more question . Questions are as follows : 1 . In which year Qatar going to host FIFA World Cup ? 2 . What do you mean by `` Expect amazing '' 3 . What will you do if Qatar do n't allow bachelor to enter stadiums during WC as you will be in here on single status once you selected as cabin crew ? 4 . What will you do when you will see from your aircraft window that a landcruiser running faster than your plane ? 5 . What will be the difference of your behave while you on duty as cabin crew between the flights to Indian sub-continent & to Europe/US ? 6 . What will you do when you see someone 's -LRB- Not from Indian continent -RRB- attitude in Qatar pretend to be he/she from royal family in his/her home country but actually not . 7 . What you will do when you will find a job in Qatar with better package than QA but can not go because of sponsorship law ? Find answer for all these questions & go for interview .
lol on number 4 !!
LOL Swine Flew ... = -RRB-
hi . . i have one question , maybe stupid but . . :-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- So you get contract on 3 years ... that means you are those 3 years in Doha ? you are going home ??
Interview questions are not fixed . They vary from candidate to candidate . Just tell the truth when asked anything and you will be fairly judged .
1 -RRB- why do you want to be a flight attendant ? 2 -RRB- do you consider this as a career ? 3 -RRB- how do you handle stressful situations ? 4 -RRB- how would you handle a complaint ? 5 -RRB- what do u mean by exceptional customer service ? Why do you think some passengers take their frustrations out on cabin crew , even though the cabin crew are trying to help them ? What would you do if you saw one of your colleagues being deliberately rude to a passenger ? If , for example , there are 60 children on the flight , but you only have 40 toys . How would you deal with this situation ? What would you do if the seat belt signs were on and the aircraft is about to take off , but a passenger insist that he has to kneel down to conduct his prayer due to religious reasons ? What would you do if you lost an engine on take off ?
What would you do if you lost an engine on take off ? 1 -RRB- Control the aircraft , keeping it on the runway centreline . declaring MAYDAY x 3 2 -RRB- Rotate and establish a positive climb . 3 -RRB- Around 400 ' recall or ECAM actions can be initiated to secure the engine or extinguish any fire . Basically thrust lever to idle , master switch off and then fire swithes and extinguishers if required . 4 -RRB- Once completed and above Minimum Flap Retraction Altitude -LRB- ~ 1000 ' -RRB- accelerate and clean up the aircraft . 5 -RRB- Once all this is done and safely flying , complete any remaining checklists and prepare for a return forr landing .
Captain K , you expect CABIN CREW to do all that !?!?!?
nope . . just felt to answer the question . . the FA can keep their n the pax nerves calm
Are you a commander or FO ?
Captkhan before all those . . gime a parachute . . bleeez
What would you do if you lost an engine on take off ? Is n't there something about putting your head between someone 's knees and assuming the position ?
<p> Hello everyone , I am a 38 year old woman and I have worked for airlines in Europe before , I wonder though if 38 is too old for Qatar Airways , even for ground staff . Any input would be appreciated . </p> <p> </p> <p> Thank you , </p>
If you are going to attend one of an open day with Qatar Airways , you should bear on your mind that the most important thing for them to accept you as a cabin crew is the shine on your eyes . They do not expect from you to answer the all specific questions on a professional way . They just want to know that whether you are able to be a cabin crew -LRB- Reaching 2.10 metres on your toes , no tattoo -RRB- and want to work with Qatar Airways . If you have the ability to impress people by your desire of being a cabin crew with Qatar Airways , then you are also able to impress the Human R. managers at the interview . Good Luck !
<p> hmm , so one has to be 2.10 m tall and have shiny eyes to be a QA cabin cew ... hmmmm ... funny thing , I have flown with Qa many times , but never had the pleasure to see this particular specimen of cabin cew . </p> <p> Most of them were about 1.50 m and certainly did not have shiny eyes ... they were able to serve food and drinks though ... mostly . </p>
let me try to manufacture a car then you can buy and register with this number , ha aha haaa .
You have to go to traffic department . This plate number has a penalty of QR500 . http://www.moi.gov.qa/site/english/eServices/index.html

Firstly you must be mad , secondly I think as a non-qatari you can only buy in Westbay Lagoon , The Pearl and the Lusail development . Starting price for studio -LRB- no bedroom -RRB- is about QAR 850,000 c. US$ 234,000 . Most Bedroomed apartments -LRB- 2 bed -RRB- appear to be QAR 2,000,000 + c. US$ 550,000 + . Villas are QAR 7,000,000 +
Visit the developers marketing offices . Considering the state of the market - buyers , they 'll come to you . You can start with direct purchase with the developers at porto arabia , Bahriyah , and other specific areas where expats are allowed freehold/leasehold properties . You can also look at the secondary market to buy properties already purchased . Criteria - you need to have the funds to purchase and abide with their terms and conditions in the sale agreement .
Never think of it dude ... .
`` Mad '' is not enough . You must be an insane idiot . Then you can buy property in Qatar .
Hey Man ur crazy to buy a property over here ... ... ... . if u hve too much money give to the poor u will become more reach ... ... ... ... god always help those who help others ... ... ... ... . . if ur an indian invest in India if not ... ... ... ... ... . ? good luck
cook some cake and knock the doors of your neibours and introduce yourself and then u will come to know some people and then u go out with them ur kids play with their kids `` under ur observation ''

Meet your friend and take him to Dubai . And definitely do n't have the so-called non-alcoholic beer .
Never attempt to try it out in the street other than the enclosure of your home . Be it restuarant or hotel these moral police will exercising their ego jobs . If your friend have liqour permit why not ask him earlier on to buy few bottlse at QDC in anticipation of your coming .
DO NOT , I repeat , DO NOT attempt to buy alcohol from the duty free and bring it here ... they will take it = . . -LRB-
All the * hotels will serve you alcohol ... . only if you are staying with them ... only in your room . Aana free , jaana free , Pakde gaye tho khana free .
nothing . your friend better have some at home to enjoy .
Kia !!!! But I am biased . Everything about the Kia is good - service centre , show room , the CAR !!!! Especially the Mohave ! Seriously though , I went to get my Kia serviced and was in and out within one hour ! They even offered us a hire car whilst ours was being serviced , but we chose to wait instead .
hyundai and kia . like lexus and toyota . KIA is owned by HYUNDAI . they both share technology , engine , transmission and electricals . just differ in looks . i know that kia spare parts are ridiculously expensive and available only in agency . HYUNDAI is the best compared to KIA .
Neither ! Both are Korean cars and have poor resale value ... only my 2 cents worth advice .
When I been in Korea in 2002 I asked some Koreans what is the best local automaker by their oppinion ? All of them told me that it 's Hyundai .
Hyundai and Kia are both controlled by the same Korean parent . BUT JAPENESSE CARS LIKE TOYOTA HAVE BETTER QUALITY . BUT IF YOU HAD TO PICK CHOOSE BETWEEN HYUNDAI AND KIA PICK HYUNDAI . BECOUSE ALSO THE RESALE PRICE OF KIA IS NOT GOOD . HOPE THE ABOVE HELPS : BYE
Hi , In Musheireb area , close to Sofitel hotel U get plenty of lighting shops & plumbing material hole sell / retail sellers . -LRB- between Sofitel signal & Arab bank R/A . -RRB- the road adjoining QNB bank is the right place .
try along Najma area as well ...
<b> <i> ... ... . . there are many shops in Najma !! ... . .
<b> <i> ... ... and also near Arab Bank Roundabout :-RRB- ... . .
hi there call 5567196 , they will help you with all plumping & electrical materials with work .
Nice going Monna where else but your friendly hardware .
You could also check out Ansar City on Salwa road just after the Teyseer petrol station . They have all kinds of stuff . Most of it is from China though .
well , - if you are coming from Cinema Signal and going to the Hot Bread Bakery , keep going strait on that road you 'll find shops on both sides , you also could keep going strait to you reach the next signal then turn right `` Haraj '' there is a lot of hardware stores there
Go back to QDC they will tell you what to do Picture on the card so that they can not sell any one if your picture is on the card Also Security is not allow the person into the shop if the picture is not matching with real one that is why they are taking picture when you renew your licence
oh my . !!!!!!!! . . of all the cards you lost the one that mattered most ... Looks like The festival must have been a dry one for you and the guys you shared it with
Yes I am all broken up about it . I 'd appreciate it if you had some useful information to add . : -RRB-
For anyone who has this problem ... I found out that the QDC is happy to replace your card at no cost as long as you can bring your Qatar ID down to the shop . Nice to see this is not a big hassle . I guess they want to make sure you can spend your money on booze and swine ! : -RRB-
Dont know , whats a QNB note ?
QNB Note is an investment product where the Capital is Guaranteed - so at the end of the investment period you are at least guaranteed your initial investment . The investment is linked to the performance of the Qatar Stock Exchange over the next 2 years . Obviously nobody knows how the stock market will do but I am pretty confident that over the next 2 years the investment should do better than the return on a Fixed Deposit inshallah ! So if you have an investment strategy that involves equities then this product has got little downside - principal guaranteed so if all else fails - its just the opportunity cost on the money for 2 years - versus the upside of the Qatar Stock Market . Dont need to be an Einstein to figure this one out ...
You should be able to do the same by following these two simple steps , 1 . Take 75 % of the total amount you want to put into this scheme into a high yielding fixed deposit scheme with any major like CBQ . 2 . The remaining 25 % , invest in equities yourself . If the markets do well , you will make much more than you will with the notes , if the markets fare very badly , you will still have earned interest on the fixed deposit to offset the 25 % loss on your equity investment portfolio . Rgds , J.J
my two bits are , , that min . investment is Qar . 20 k for a tenor of 2 years . if u put 20 k in bank , u get max . 6 % per annum . . I think , that in two years . QE will give u at least return of 6 % p.a keeping in view , the QE at around 7300 nowadyas . . The worst scenario is that u will get your 20 k back after 2 years . . HAving invested directly in QE directly , i had burnt my hands . however , i still am in favour of QNB NOTE 1 , due to its timings . As QE is still not gone too high .
i am also interested in this . . and like to know more about it . . i am watching :-RRB- . . please update more
i dont think there is any problem . but for your curiosity better to check with doha port . or anybody who is working in doha port can guide you better .
Thank you johnpu ...
that is OK . a friend of mine bought her formal dress online when we had a party ... ------------ mai lain pa !
I think it would be allowed as long as you do n't buy a T-shirt with a Qatarsucks printed on it
Ara Mina
just be yourself ...
You would need 1500 to cover decent food and travelling .
Look up the hotels in Doha . Most charge 1000 for one night !
guys ... do n't discourage him.Let him come and have a good time.He could find cheaper hotels for 150 riyals per night in some remote ares like national , souq area etc and have food decently with 75 riyals per day and 400 to 500 riyals for local shopping.site seeing and taxi rents will cost another 500 riyals.So all together QR .2500 approx.Its more than enough for a decent stay .
Maybe he wanted to say 10000 and missed one zero lol . at that time it is enought . but 1000 nooooooooo wayyyyyyyy
Yes it is valid in all GCC countries . once you get the UAE residency you go to the UAE traffic department with the original Qatari licence and copy too , you pay 100 Dirhams and get the UAE driving licence
If you are getting a job in any other GCC country then it means you 'll need to apply for a valid local DL in that country . If you are going to any GCC on a `` Tourist '' base then yes it is valid . Regards !!
I know that you can use a Qatari Driving License supported by your Qatari RP to rent a car in the UAE , but if you leave here to work there would imagine you need to do a test for the UAE , unless your home license can be automatically transferred . Should also imagine that once your RP is cancelled your Qatari license irrespective of date on it would also be cancelled .
your Qatar DL is valid in Qatar & can be converted to Omani license , Bahrain , Kuwait but not uae . u need give test in uae.if you fail u need to take classes opening file and keep trying your luck . getting UAE License is not so easy as u get in Qatar . u need good luck and if not u shed lot money in attempts . overall ur Qatari license is not valid to get uae DL . U Need to go through above process .
I got my driver 's licence in Saudi Arabia and when I transfered here in Qatar , it was still valid for 2 months . I was able to convert it to Qatar driver 's licence because Saudi and Qatar are part of GCC . I just do n't know if this is also applicable if you go out of Qatar and convert it to UAE driver 's license when you work there . But I have a strong feeling that it can be done since UAE is also part of GCC .
i am from uae , having valid uae license , i confirm no Other GCC or Asian DL can be directly converted to UAE DL . apply for a road test if u pass ur lucky.if u fail u need to take minimum 5 class . then try till u succeeded .
No free course .

The State of Qatar issues Tourist Visas on arrival for nationals of 33 countries : Andorra , Australia , Austria , Belgium , Brunei , Canada , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , Hong Kong , Iceland , Ireland , Italy , Japan , Liechtenstein , Luxemburg , Malaysia , Monaco , New Zealand , Norway , Portugal , San Marino , Spain , Sweden , Singapore , South Korea , Switzerland , The Netherlands , USA , UK , Vatican City . This service allows travelers or hotels to apply for a visa online ahead of time . Applicants are required to supply a sponsor ID in the application , which can be from a relative living in Qatar or an ID supplied by a hotel . Citizens from outside the above countries should arrange for a tourist visa through a Qatari embassy or hotel in Qatar . Source : Hukoomi
I think GCC Residents in Managerial level can get visa on arrival .
i hope u that guy is eligible for visa on arrival , for confirmation you can take his paasport copy to paasport office near airport and cross check it
Thank you everybody for the help . Yes , he can get visa . Cheers
I buy from all three places plus mwave.com , zipzoomfly.com and amazon.com . I use bongo us mail forwarding as they consolidate shipments . With aramex , each parcel is shipped separately and there is a minimum charge . So if you buy a memory card that weighs next to nothing you pay $ 30 or so . I believe aramex then charges about $ 8 US per pound for heavier parcels . Bongo consolidates - gathers all your parcels and weighs them as if they were one . They ship all your parcels as one shipment . You will save hundreds of dollars over a year of shipments . I have gotten shipments that I have paid only $ 6 a pound for and saved on consolidation . Check them out they are fantastic . http://www.bongous.com/parcel_forwarding.php Aramex should wake up and provide consolidation services . DHL is also laughable as they do not consolidate . Fedex is never going to do that as they make too much on commercial shipments .
hey , i know that www.qbay.com -LRB- the ebay site for qatar -RRB- will be available but I do n't know when . Someone was telling me that it will be very safe because you need to enter your qatar mobile number into the site and then varify your identity with an sms code . Clever stuff ?? it will keep the scammers away im sure
Thanks for the answers guys . Just wanted to confirm that Aramex is safe ...
I am a permanant ebay shopper . I would advise you to always check the feedback of the seller . Do n't buy if the seller 's positive feedback is lower than 99 % .

actually i 'm new to Qatar . i heard that entire area of Corniche have free WIFI accessibility . is that a reliable information ??
Yes , parks along with the corniche have free Wi-Fi access you can see the indication boards there as well .
Yeah , the WIFI parks project makes sure that all of the parks have free WIFI . I 'm not sure how fast or safe it is though . Free WIFI is sketchy . I 've earned my networking and OSCP certificate recently and let 's just say that you 're better off not entering in private banking or email information when using wifi .
Thanks a lot friends for your valuable information 's .
Thanks for all the advice . Regards Rsai

Moza indeed in Arabic can also mean banana as well as a woman 's name . However I do n't see how this thread has anything to do with me . I 'm not even into spearfishing !
I said you ` are banana ' , moza . We say that , when somebody is crazy .

must need visa
yes ...
Of course need . . but till 3 months no need . . baby can come with the mother . . !!
Yes you have to pass by Dammam , i 'm planning to visit kuwait by car as well , can u advise the name of the hotel that arranged the visa and how much does it cost
Thanks Sanishazi . You can check this website and communicate with them : http://www.moevenpick-hotels.com/en/pub/your_hotels/worldmap/kuwait/overview.cfm The cost for visa is 8KD / passport . How is road condition ? I use travel outside Qatar with my car every holiday session but I dont have much information about itinerary road to Kuwait . Kuwait is the only GCC country that I have n't visit yet by road .
reaching DAMMAM means half of the way and the most complicated part has passed ... just go north to Jubail road and follow the signs ... the road is good . . by the way , Visa can be obtained based on your job title either on the border or airport . . same as Dubai .
faisalw : plan to travel by car also can you share me requirements needed to travel by car from Doha/Kuwait ? i used to travel via plane 2x a month . . thanks
Hi Momo - I asked Kuwait embassy staff here and they told me that I must get the visa before enter to border land eventhough my RP title is mohandis . If travel by plane is ok I can get the visa on arrival but for travel by road little different . But it 's ok now since hotel can arrange the visa . Hi Remy - There is no special requirement . The Movenpick Hotel Kuwait just give me the form and I need to fill-up and sent it back to them and pay the fee using credit card -LRB- 8 KD/passport -RRB- . After I get the Kuwait visa then I need to apply KSA transit visa . Once we get KSA transit visa then halas we can travel to Kuwait by road .
I 've seen them in carrefour .
thank you Jassim .
do you have a bat to smack it on my head i saw them and i cant remember where .
Yeah I too have seen them in Carrefour a couple of months ago . Even if it is not available now then you can register your mobile in carrefour . They will call you back after it comes again .
No worries Da , got it covered !

what are the procedures ?? what are the documents i need to bring , , is there any form to fill . . photo required ?? pls reply ...
Once your family arrived here , you can go for medical in medical commision -LRB- abu hamoor -RRB- . you should take original passport and visa copy with 100 riyals . You will get the result in couple of days after stamping ... One has to take passport -LRB- Original & Copy -RRB- , passport size photographs plus copy of visa . Forms are available at the Medical Commission & will be filled in by the female staff for around QR 10/each .
navas , i did the VISIT VISA extension -LRB- 1 +5 -RRB- for MY MOM and went for the medical procedure as well . . We did n't get the result on the spot . . We got it after 4days FYI ... thnx So you could also be wrong ?? :-RRB- -RRB- . .
navas , so you were lucky to get the result on the same day ... So kindly do n't say that i gave the wrong information . . I 've hardly given any wrong advises to anyone on QL so far . . You can check my track records . . ok ...
Go to medical commission there working hours 7:30 till 11am the documents needed passport and visa copy and the ATM card for payments thats all no need to fill any form and no photograph . they will fill the information on the counter and charges will be 100 riyals and they will post the result to immigration department it will take 1 week in my case i took 1 week but u can check the result online after 1 or 2 days but seeing a online result does not mean that results are already with immigration it will take some time so better to go after 1 week to immigration after medical
They do n't work on Saturdays . I just took my parents and went last Saturday at 6:30 am after i read here in QL that the commission work from Saturday to Thursday but it was closed . they work from Sundays to Thursdays .
Thanks Sonia ... Wonderful ...
Try to find some saloon near your house ... if No you can go London beauty Saloon beside Ele-france or Maha Saloon in Town Center .

PM me and I 'll send you my contact . She is good . If you are interested that is .
Habibti Facial threading would cost you around 90-100 rials per month plus it is very painful & disturbing to see the pimples appearing on face thereafter but if you go to Plastisurgi for Laser treatment for facial hair removal they 'll charge you around 500 for full face laser which includes the neck area too & the pain is very minimal as compared to threading & the hair would get back only after 6/7 months depending upon the thickness of your hair .
try Glow salon and Spa ...
I too against of LASER coz i have seen the side effects . . I go for my facial threading at DOHA BEAUTY CENTRE . . they r thorough professionals and do very safely . . They wont allow ne pimples or rashes to appear after that . . So u can tell ur wife to try there . . Its in lulu centre . .
If you want to come back within 2 years after cancellation of the current visa you need NOC from your current employer . No matter if the contract is finished or terminated . I dont know what you mean by freedom visa .
No you can not enter in this country for next 2 years after your visa cancellation if you dont have NOC if your able to get NOC you can come again anytime you wish in any visa Visit Visa , Permanent Visa , On Arrival Visa , Work Visa , and Freedom Visa this country have lot of visa and you know subject to rules ... . .
lol . . not much freedom here . . so dunno whats the freedom visa u talking about . .
There is no such thing as a freedom visa . It is illegal to purchase a visa from a person for whom you will not be working . No one is `` free '' to work wherever he wishes in Qatar .
lol Khattak , good question ? before 6am even birds dont tweet around ... : -RRB-

they have various ones starting from 650 to 1800 . better you drive down there and check for yourself . Also Modern Home next to jarir had some good offers , with the case and everything .
in badie it depends on the brand you buy brands like ibanez are from 1500 to 3000
acoustic electric guitars they are very nice
All those sound quite boring ... : /
Well , it 's a tough time to arrive , that 's for sure ! There are western-oriented places that can be visited during the day , but you 'll have to remember that there is no eating , drinking , smoking or gum-chewing allowed while out during the day . That said , here are a few places I know that are open at least for a little while , each day and then also in the evenings . Carrefour - 9 a.m. - 1 a.m. Sat-Thurs - Villagio & City Center MegaMart - 8:30 a.m. - 1 a.m. Sat-Thurs - Landmark , The Centre Just about all the malls are open from 10 a.m. to around 1 or 2 and then re-open around 8 in the evening , so you can get a few hours of shopping in during the day and then go back at night if you run out of time . I understand the Iftar buffets are marevelous and served at most hotels . That would be your late evening meal , and well worth the wait from what I 'm told -LRB- I 've only been here since late July , so I have n't had a chance to do all the Ramadan things offered yet -RRB- Find a reliable taxi driver , and you 'll be all set to pop around to the various malls to get better acclimated to the area . Once the heat eases off in a couple months , it would be easier to get around by getting a drop off at a central location and then walking around the city a bit . Get a Marhaba at a bookstore if you do n't already have one ; it is THE best resource for all this kind of stuff ! Have fun !

VBProgrammer I have to decide on a service or a product before conducting a feasibility study . As for the capital , I have 2 options . 100,000 that I can invest anywhere -LRB- the problem is that it 's too small -RRB- , the other option is 1 million but this amount belongs to a company that is under establishment for educational services . So in this case any project must be in the educational sector . -LRB- to which we already have a business plan , but it 's pending as we originally projected a capital of 5 million not only 1 -RRB- . Perhaps you 'll suggest that we switch to another non-educational project . That might be Plan B if we could n't attract more investors . wizz14 : I 'm both an investor and looking for investors/partners .

Welcome to Qatar ... I 've seen one traffic accident attended by the Traffic police while another just happened with a Qatari involve , that Policeman simply leave the rest and serve the Qatari first .
Actually it has nothing to do with law . Its just manners and being a dick & acting like one
I wonder when people will whack up and go from this country .
Qatari-bashing should be a forum thread and not a question .
first of all qatari men are very rich second the law is by their side so qatari men = super rich men plus some of them have manner issues = dick so they are super dickless rich men :-RRB- hehehheheeheh

Rizks ... lol ... I can understand your dilemma ... : -RRB-
rizks stay out , you 're not helping . there are lots of gents salons in the najma/mansuora area .
ur lucky no need to spend on ur bald head : -LRB-
which hair ?
At the barber shop across the street .
For the first three posters in this thread , what a non sense reply . Sincerely get a life . I 'm asking for a sensible question that yields a sensible answer . Sheez . Can you specify a salon that cater to like a `` fade '' haircut ?
Boys haircut , try to city center the name is cute cut for man and for children i think its in the 3rd floor infront of hello kitty store . Barber 's try in Al Nassr street there 's a lot over there ask . Hope it helps ! Good luck !
cool down nigel :-RRB- there is barber shop in al meera mansuora , try it there
Al Nasser Mataar Street
Lorena i likes ur avataar pic ... :-RRB- Muntazah area there are lots of barber shops as well as in Old Airport Area . Check out in Villagio , there is a barber from your place who cuts good hairs .
Mariee Clare
you can find filipino barber shop in soq , al sadd , al nasser ...
Ok for a sensible reply ... Tryout this one ... Coming from Ramada side take left on the first roundabout after Muntazah Health centre and look for this salon on your right -LRB- about 100m -RRB- ... all Jordanian young guys there ... there is another one run by filipinos just a couple of shops next to them , which I am not sure about .
Dear Nigel Please excuse Mr. Rizks . You have hit raw nerve because he is bald and pines to visit a barber . There are ofcourse many barbers available . From side street barbers who will cut your hair for a snip to upmarket lebanese barbers whose prices will make your hair stand on end . Good Luck
If you go to Vilaggio or Landmark Malls they have a chain hairdresser called Patrice Salon . Do a good job , quick but a little pricey .
baldrick you are Bald Rick and i am Bald Rizks ... we both have so much similarities ... : -RRB-
I cut my own hair , number zero . Invest in some hair clippers . Grrr .
Baldrick & Bald Rizks ... you both are the same person with different ids ... trying to create confusion on a simble best barber thread ... Personally for me the best is Raj Babbar : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raj_Babbar
From their pics , they both seem to have cold noses also . .
Exactly ... brit ... ; -RRB-
LOL . Nonetheless I appreciate all your response . Thanks .
MODS . . Please delete this thread before Rizks goes any lower :O -LRB-
Well , apparently you do n't know the `` fade '' I was talking about . To answer your question , tis in my head hair . =-RRB- I concur kindly close this thread . I think I know where am going next . Thanks .
I 'm just waiting for the mods to delete Rizks ; o -RRB-
go to barwa village wakrah , there is a barber shop they offers free gift on every hair cutting , i m serious this time only !!!
i do n't i am saving money by not cutting my hair :P

Never tell conartists -LRB- housing agents -RRB- your budget for a Villa ! They will show you something worth 10,000 QAR and tell you it 's worth 15,000 ! Check online for aparthotels which rent out apartments on weekly / monthly basis . And another thing - it is illegal for agents to charge you sometimes as much as a months ' comission for showing you Villas . They get their commission from the landlord but many still try and ` con ' the prospective tenant . Just a bit of advise - good luck !
EZDAN TOWERS !! THATS YOUR ANSWER ...
Probability of getting job as a School Teacher is very high .
PLEASE try places like QATAR OFUNDATION , OTHER UNIVERSITIES IN QATAR , and do an online yellow page search of all the pharmacetical companies , that may require research assistants . Dont worry , you will find a good job soon
@Bluemountain ... Unless someone does ' t give a job how will anyone ever gain experience . I just hate that sentence . To the rest of the people ... thank you so much . . you all are great . God bless you .
i agree , hamad is the good and safest hospital in doha , others are just money making . .
If money and time are not the objection , go to Singapore . The have proffesional service and doctors .
which peadiatrician is the best there ? plz let me know so that i can take an appt for the evening clinic .
Equipment wise , Technology Wise , Consultants and Surgeons wise , HAMAD HOSPITAL is realy the BEst in Qatar .
Equipment Wise , Technology Wise , Consultancy Wise , Surgeons Wise ... . . I wud say HAMAD HOSPITAL is realy BEST in QATAR .
I think I paid something like QAR 30-40 , do n't remember very well :--LRB- Depends which one you buy , some are like crayons and some paint , the ones with paint will contain a brush / sponge too . I prefer the crayon types , they are easier to colour with .
You could try Party Kingdom in Bin Mahmoud , B-Ring Road just right before Midmac Round About .
check out one in Nasrallah Centre before jaidah fly-over going down from Mannai underpass ! unfortunately i forgot the name of shop . but sure you fill find out there what you looking for : -RRB-

Genesis ... you are right !!! but whats the point for an expat to attend the local career fair when they come to a foreign land to work and not to attend workshops ... attending workshops and seminars can be done before they come here or take up a job .

Egg/Omlet Paratha specially available in Bombay ... the list is huge and I m fasting ...
Dhal bhati
There 's one resto that 's called Heaven 's N Egg , all kinds of Eggs but a universal menu as well ... What 's Paratha ? Sorry to temp you about food =-LRB- a few more days and its already done , Eid is coming .
What 's Dhal bhati ? need to research more on this food = -RRB-
It is one of the most popular unleavened flat-breads in Indian cuisine and is made by pan frying whole-wheat flour on a tava . -LSB- 2 -RSB- The paratha dough usually contains ghee or cooking oil which is also layered on the freshly prepared paratha . -LSB- 3 -RSB- Parathas are usually stuffed with vegetables , such as boiled potatoes , radishes or cauliflower and/or paneer -LRB- South Asian cheese -RRB- . A paratha -LRB- especially a stuffed one -RRB- can be eaten simply with a blob of butter spread on top but it is best served with pickles and yoghurt , or thick spicy curries of meat and vegetables . Some people prefer to roll up the paratha into a tube and eat it with tea , often dipping the paratha into the tea ... BTW ... Omlet stuffed Paratha square in shape ... available in Bombay .
salax85 ... lol ... Victory_278692 ... I was never a fan of frankies ... :-LRB- Stuffed paratha is available here ... in most Indian hotels ... also in Bombay Chowpathy : http://www.qatarliving.com/reviews/restaurants/indian/bombay-chowpatty
beluga caviar i always wanted to try it
Bro , Try Industrial Area Street No 1 called Salam Keys -LRB- by the petrol pump besides mannai -RRB- . They make computerised keys , they can make a key which will start the engine . Cheers ,
U ill have to oder keys through ur car agency by courrier they can do it immediately , it happened to me once i have Audi S6 and i lost keys in the gass ... . . and i had to leave my car parked at corniche for 8 days . cheers .
There is a key shop next to the Doha Bank opp mecurre -LRB- sofitel -RRB- hotel down town , you could try him , he does some electronic keys not all
There are a bunch of keysmiths along Sofitel Street -LRB- if you are coming from Souq Najada -RRB- . They charged me 200 riyals for the key . YOu can bargain some more to avail lesser price .
after I got the duplicate key from the agency it was still to be shaped in a key shop . I went to a shop in industrial area petrol station -LRB- street number 2 -RRB- opposite mercedes . I was told by the person there that he have the same machones like the agency and I would have saved if I came to him first , , , try there .
Your key is purposely made to have a code for security reasons . It would be better to have it ordered to a Nissan dealer , and not somewhere else . But if you dont mind having ur key code known by others , you can get a cheaper service somewhere else .
Dealer ONLY .
Well HOUSEWIVES are known as the bosses of the house too . . I think the OP missed out to mention this . . :-RRB- -RRB-
Wife leaving in the House only , not in the office ...
Saeed tat seems to be mean.comment ... .
If u dont know how to make jokes just keep quiet , its so silly
It seems a kind of friendz chat going on ... ?
Being a House wife is the most difficult thing in this world not a silly joke . if somebody has said this he would argue for 4 pages but it doesnt apply to this guy ??

It will take u like 2 hours . U have to take the North Road or the one to Golf club first , then drive doha to Dukhan . Depends on the hours you may will get some traffic . Are you planning to do this every day or just one weekend ??? if its everyday move from Al Khor . There is no problem for female drivers , I believe you drive better than any of those bus drivers or pick up drivers ... The Venezuelan Sensation !!!
Its a very long drive ... Whew ! thinking of it makes me feel lazy and sleepy ! The road going to dukhan is under construction so you should be extra cautious on driving specially at night.becoz there are some areas w/o lights . It is safe for everyone , but like i said just be careful . And yeah i also suggest that if you 'll do this everyday , might as well move in to dukhan or at least doha ... You are talking about approximately 150-160kms kms drive in one way alone ! <aÂ target=_blankÂ href=http://www.blingcheese.com/> <imgÂ src=http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s235/revmyspace2/graphics/Brand/Cars/cars_9_aavd.gifÂ title=MySpaceÂ CommentsÂ border=0> </a> <br> <aÂ target=_blankÂ href=http://www.blingcheese.com/> MySp
I am travelling to Dukhan and back to Doha on a daily basis and I do n't find any problem with that . In fact the road is much more convenient now that they have finished most of the road works . But I 'd like to know the road condition from Al Khor to Dukhan and back to Al Khor . I understand that it would take almost the same time like Doha-Dukhan ... thanks
Those who said it takes 2 hrs to get to Dukhan from Doha were wrong . However , the drive itself is boring . It was safe even on the previous service road but now that most of the road works is near completion , driving there should be fun . I myself would go to Dukhan very soon before chilling winter begins ... lol ******************************************* Freedom is the right of all sentient beings
what is there in dukan any fun thing ot watch during weekend tirp for those who have not been there ?
All of the above are talking about Al khor to Dukhan Via Doha but I remember there is a direct route to Dukhan from Al Khor through Jamaliya which is shorter and around 45 minutes drive . Ban Spoon Feeding not Me
Joan you get on North road dont drive towards doha drive towards north about 15km you will notice a Petrol pump and Police Station on your left side there is a turn to Zubara before the police station . Get on that Road to Zubara keep Driving till you see another left turn Ghawriya its a on that road keep Driving till you reach the dead end thats IN Jamiliya take right go straitght for 2 minutes another dead end take left turn there and drive for 25min its a free road with no heavy traffic on it you will land on Dukhan Road you take right turn and Dukhan is just 10mins away from you . That all Drive will take you around 70-80min . If you go via Doha will take you long 2 hours for sure . <imgÂ src=http://images.cooltext.com/155194.gif>

can i bring for my wife to business visa
Validity of the visa is written on right side of the visa it is 3 months from the date of issue . The visa holder should travel within 3 months from date of issue and can stay only for one month from the date of arrival . This visa can be extended for another 2 months
I 'm looking for office in Doha who issues business visa . Do you know any ? thanks
Actually holidays are up to the policies of companies , public offices , and others . Stores and shopping malls are working , banks maybe ... i do not know , yopu might give it a try during the day to see what you can get . BTW ... sorry I ca n't be really helpful Best regards
@ Mayartolba to bring your fiance to Qatar just go to Qatar airways office next to Alama building and apply for a bsuiness visa this is the easiest way .
I am using Samsung Dual Sim mobile for the last 2 years and it works perfect . Contact Samsung dealers .
CALL 5869478 or sms he will provide you dual sim iphone .
Mega Mart behind the Ramada are selling dual sim card phones from China . They are good but little expensive . The same phones are cheaper in Dubai . I have been using one for 8 months with no problem . Price was approx 600AED with TV 660AED
Hey Guys , Thanks for the answers . Just a couple of questions ; 1 . The samsung & the chinese phones - do they have `` real '' dual sim capabilities . ie . Can you use both sim cards simultaneously or do you have to switch between the 2 networks allowing you to operate only on 1 sim at a time 2 . Do the chinese phones come with warranty ? is it easy to replace parts / gt it serviced etc . . Thanks again guys Cheers
China Dual SIM Phones : No warranty is provided for any China Phones ; No spare parts seen yet except for battery , charger and cables ; With proper care , they can last a good time ; Most china dual sims are with TV , radio , cam , etc. , If you are on a budget , this fones will do
I will speak for the Samsung SHG D880 . The following is from its user manual guide : ---------------------------------------------------- SIM card switching Your phone supports the Dual SIM cards mode , enabling you to use two SIM cards at the same time without changing them . Activate SIM cards and select the primary SIM card . 1 . In the idle mode , press the swithching button at the left side of the phone . 2 . Scroll to the SIM card you want to use and select Enable or Primary . 3 . Press -LCB- Options -RCB- and select Save . If you change the primary SIM card , the phone automatically turns off and back on . ** You can use Browser , E-mail , multimedia messages , and STK Applications services only with the primary SIM card . ---------------------------------------------------- As far as I 'm concerned with my phone , it does n't need restarting since the sim from my country is only used to receive SMS messages and not for calls . That works for me just fine . You can always go to the store bringing with you one Qtel and one Vodafone sim cards and you can try it for yourself before you decide to buy .
Paul Henson , I have 3 dogs , been with them for 1.1 / 2 now and very very happy . they even offer kennels service but I found their kennels to be small . Phone : 4216405 , they are located somewhere opposite Villagio . Good luck .
I have used the LG dual sim for a short while ... troublesome as it keeps getting stuck . I am not aware of any that is perfect to use at the moment . just go to a telephone shop and they will show you the phone . good luck .

Dear Deni11 Thank You for the precise info .
Keidoupe salamat kabayan ko ;-RRB- ... MMAwan ... Qatar rules and Qataris mentality are not developing at all . . Development is thoughts not only more money
I agree with you warm_heart but I meant to say economy , Hotels etc. there is always place empty on the top , but I just camper with Bahrain not rest of the world.about mantality and rules , I hope it is develping day by day , learning is continue process , world is learning from each others . hope for good .
Warm_heart you are correct Qatar is not that develop yet , and most of local attitude can be identified along the roads and highways . But anyway , we should understand that , because a shift from camel to landcruiser will have a lot of change ! :-RRB-
No not bcoz of that , see the same in Dubai and Bahrain , but the ppl there r good
qatar changed ... . . camel to cruser ...
Guys , I 've moving around bcoz am F1 fan , Qatar is not yet in position to host something like F1 . No way at this point in time . I want to believe one day , they might me there . I 've been twice to Bahrain for the last two race , I 've been to Abu Dhabi last year n am going again this year . So , I can say here ... no way to hv F ! here in teh next 3 yrs .
Qatar wants to host an F1 race , but the track is not up to F1 pecifications yet . Besides , the race calendar for 2011 has already been pencilled in . . Lastly as someone who has watched F1 races in Europe and Bahrain , from peesonal experience I can say that the atmosphere in Bahrain sucks and ca n't believe that Qatar would be any better . .
and it 's awesome ! Lol !
I live in BAHRAIN ALSO ... they are preparing for f1 in 2011 and even 2022
qatar well take even 2022 . . this is wt i hear
DP !
Qatar doesnt have an atmosphere neither :-LRB- and i beleive if Qatar would host F1 , they will make ticket prices as high as crack
what atmosphere you want brit ?

Braveheart , I wonder how you can say that you are joining Qatar Airways next month even if you have not yet received an offer letter . Receiving an offer letter and the processing your work visa will take some time . These could even take several months in many cases .

Go home then get married . . If she plans to give birth here , then try to let her come back under your sponsorship . I know somebody who got pregnant 2 months earlier than her marriage , which was done in their embassy here and everything went fine until she gave birth at Hamad . Cheers !! One Love .
Yes you can leave and get married and then comeback . But thesooner the better before the bump shows that is .
Escape ... Run ... before you two are caught ... ... they are comming to get you ... No dont open the door ... they are waiting for you there . . ... use the window ...

LOL afsar khan , you have obviously misread this thread . Jobless has confirmed his girlfriend is NOT pregnant and he is asking this question `` hypothetically '' . I 'm telling everyone to stop worrying , it 's not a real situation . But thanks for getting personal , you should check the facts first ! ***** If you have n't got anything nice to say , do n't say anything at all *****

whether u plan to leave or not , the most important thing is that your girlfriend gets proper medical care , take her to a private clinic where they will not ask for a marriage certificate , so at least she is prescribed with the proper medication a pregnant woman should be taking , the first couple of months in a pregnancy are the most important ! Good luck anyways :-RRB- <imgÂ src=http://www.qatarliving.com/files/images/Qlip_0.jpg>
Go back home , get married and come back to work . That wo n't be a problem .
she leaves the country soon before its too late . <imgÂ src=http://www.qatarliving.com/files/images/Da.gif>
both of them leave the country at the earliest .
Get out of the country as soon as you can . `` We submit to the majority because we have to . But we are not compelled to call our attitude of subjection a posture of respect . '' Ambrose Bierce
I mean , both of you are legally singles/separated/divorced / whatever ! You 're both free to get married ! And a small advice , do it after marriage , the negative consequences is put to minimal ! `` I 'm back , simple as that ''
R u 4real ... not married , pregnant and jobless ... u really r a joke ... have u not been reading the news papers lately ... can some1 in this day and age think the way u do and in a country like QATAR ... to the couple in the situation leave at ur soonest convenience or face the penalties .
marry her soon , ask for help in phil embassy before its too late.Goodluck !
Its not yet happened !
As Stone Cold and Carlos both said , leave the country , get married there , fly back in with your marriage certificate and it 's not a problem . As long as she is married when she starts to show and -LRB- of course -RRB- when she gives birth , the authorities here are n't going to count backwards to determine the moment of conception and whether you were married then . Good luck ! `` If you 're looking for sympathy , you 'll find it between sh * t and syphilis in the dictionary . '' - David Sedaris
I agree with Azi . Forget the fact that she is pregnant . Go work on the marriage - then announce it once it is all legal . Good luck !
What if the Date of marriage and the date of birth of the child does n't match ?
Its anp80 ... heheh . . anyways , yeah u r right . . feel kinda sorry for jobless

guys : They go all in packs to awkward places like That stinky coffee shop opposite to Ramada . They talk about their cars and about their connections in Qatar . . Just like Italians talk in the US about their families . . When they see ANY girl moving , their eyes pop out , their tongues drop on the floor and they eye-rape the poor girl until she disappears . Girls : They sit down and just text . they would be on a table with celebrities but they have their phones out and they just go at it as if iphone or blackberry are brad pit 's testicles at his prime . When Guys talk to them , they mostly give that nasty look , even if they do like it deep down . They have to give the impression that they are not desperate . Those who are `` Cool '' go out to the fabulous night life in Doha . W , which is ok . Seven , is where Lebs compete on who looks the most like Antonio Banderas in Desperado . They are all Bad Boys . They walk as if their mothers were bred by dragons and not regular men . They are still stuck in 1993 when it comes to their fashion , their Jelly hair , Levis501 jeans and dare to tell them it is time for a change . British guys , mostly fat ones , have 4 drinks and they start picking up fights with our good old Egyptian friends or any other inferior nationality -LRB- inferior because of the work-visa system here -RRB- Girls ' main mission at clubs is `` GET Drinks FOR FREE '' , they could be sitting with any degenerate that has money . They are fully aware of the male-female ratio that works to their advantage , and they act accordingly . If you want to pick up ladies , you GOT TA go out . Does not matter what you look like , Just dress nice , talk outta your bum and pretend you own everything and you will get to change the oil . Another way to spend time , is to just Eat and sleep . You will end up looking like a para-shout in 2 years , lose some hair , and become a heavy smoker who 's breath and farts smell very similar . I hope this helps . It sucks but i am starting to get in the game .
I think that is in West Bay behind Salam Plaza .
Hi Im in near Al-saad plza . i want to go to public prosecution in doha . somebody told me it is near al-dafna area , sharaton R/A , lebanese school . is that correct
It 's in Westbay Area , behind THE GATE MALL , near DUNES Hotel .
go travel going to City Center , The Prosecutors Office is in the same road of the back of City Center BUT on the other side . So you can take a U-turn at the corner of City Center and turn right on the first street -LRB- after making the u-turn -RRB- . From the corner , approximately 200 meter . actually you wo n't miss it since it is the only building with iron metal barricades and the parking within the area is full . Your landmark will be , the Islamic Bank at one corner of the building itself .
Without doubt at the Marriott . Wide variety of food , great ambience .
Yes he is right !!! Mariott is worth the money

sunshine QP do hire civil engineers for your information .
Thanks everyone but is there any female civil engineer working with QP who could answer my question ... i would like to have accurate answers
Yes it 's open
yeah opened
Yes . Company MUST give u a ticket . That is according to Qatar labour law . whether u hired locally or Internationally . Since u dont get NOC u still under ur company ... if u didnt get the ticket u have the total rights to goto labour dept or a police near to u. Inshasllah they will help u.

Yes . You can ask . Read your employment contract . In our company it doesnt matter you resigned or they terminate they will provide me a ticket to fly back home .

Xena - Shukran Habibti -LRB- I guess that 's the spelling -RRB- Im yet to understand why god made you so good .
FU 's spelling is correct ... you might need spelling lessons though , and please , my name is Xena - not Xenia ;-P Nothing to do with goodness FU - just plain logical thinking :--RRB- People have enough cr * p in there own lives to deal with ... why bog yourself down with others issues ?
Xena I thought Habibti means darling -LRB- to female -RRB- . And FU knows that very well ! That is why he spelt it Habibti instead of Habibi
My God ! LoL at FU 's spelling ` Habibti ' !! Can I say Habibti to Xenia too ?
ok , put your case to rest now ... or work in CID . . there you go .
Is it really any of your business if they have sugar daddies ? It almost sounds like you are jealous that they are n't interested in you mate .
Habibti = Darling -LRB- to female -RRB- Correct - I am a female , so where is the problem ?
Xena I am also confused ! . One Arabic man taught me this word ` habibti ' and told me that men should say this to female ... but at the same time he warned me never to adress any arab women as ` habibti ' ... I really do n't know to say or not to say ?
FriedUnicorn , you can call me and pass on to me their phone numbers . . I just was thinking what type of business to establish . .
women like these will keep continue , as long as the stupid pays them .
wow ! QS you do women too !
This is your problem or her problem ? You are so ridicolous !! Do n't forgot please , to inform me , when she will drive a Rolls Royce , coz I will please her , to get me around for 10 min only , I never been in a Rolls Royce :--RRB- -RRB- And I will pay that , of course !!! PS - You are having more than 2 years school education ? Your mentality is same in the Stone age !
My `` friend '' , why u want them jailed or deported ? You ca n't afford the price they ask you for a sexual enjoy , or you are a gay and you hate the normal ladies ?!?!?!? Just forward me the mobile number of the ladies , I am not a rich man , but i can afford sometimes.I really love the prostitutes , means sex without any responsibility , after ! And try to change your Stone age mentality , otherwise you will be the amazing clown zany of the people on this site ! PS - Forgot to check inbetween the legs of the ladies , if yo dint have gynaecological medical education :--RRB- -RRB- Did u thingh , may be they have the car from the Company , for job purpose !!! Surprised ???
Thanks Xena . . and FU ... It took 2 pages to make you understand this little simple concept . Thanks for putting this thread to `` bed '' :--RRB- We here to earn our bread and fulfill our commitments . . let 's stay focused on that . . and say bye bye . .
Oh , yes , that 's true , Fred and Barney are more amazing people than this rude person , which one want to expulse 2 ladies , because he suppose , they are doing ... prostitution ... He do n't know the prostitution is the oldest job in the world and in some circumstances , one of the most honorable !!!! Without prostitutes , some guys will stay in the jail , because life without sexual activity is ... IMPOSSIBLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! may be this rude guy is not having more than 2 years school education.He is thinking same as an unliterate man !
Hahaha Circuit , you just got OWNED by Qhris .
LOL ! Qhris Btw I really do n't know why this circuit started making personal attacks on me ... without any provocation . And he is badmouthing a religion too ! He has distorted the name of a Hindu God Ganpati -LRB- Lord Ganesh , the elephant God -RRB- and called him Gandpati which I think is offensive in Indian lingo ! I do n't know what he has against the Gods ?
I am worried though , he said us non-believers will land somewhere terrible . I am scared it might be the Irish Bar : - -LRB-
Although if hell is the Irish Bar ... they wo n't let me in ! Heaven it is for me !!! : - -RRB-
Wow ! Johannum ! Thats the place for me . I really would like to go there .
Is a Fireman ?
LOL ! Qhris I can see that you were denied entry to Johannum by a Pinay last night !
We could all resort to personal attacks , but that is the refuge of children and people who are too stupid to have a reasoned argument . Is n't that right Circuit ?
hey dude , just mind your own thing . envy kills . . : -RRB-
Why I worship Pigs too ! Pig is an important God in my religion . Now what do you intend to do about it ?
I can see that circuit is very well brought up ! A pedigree one I should say .
But I am afraid that the MODs may soon short circuit him !
Is desperate to meet a man off QL , he 's asking everyone out ! :--RRB- Now edifis ! Makes me feel used , you moved on so quickly : - -LRB-
FU : do they make a lot of noise ? Is that what 's really bothering you ? Remember , prostitutes does exist for one reason : They have enough customers . Welcome to the real world !!!!! : D
FU just give me their phone nos ... I will do the rest ; -RRB-
Ca n't people just mind their own business ?
Jack what will you do with 2 . Pass one 2 me .
I have no idea why you are bothering FU - and its not like you to be so interfering . I am a firm believer in Karma - if you report to deport these girls - its not good karma - I am sorry , your reasons I have read for you doing this , does n't justify your motives . I think its disgraceful that people interfer in other peoples lives . Who cares what they are doing or where they are doing it ? Is it hurting you ? Mind your own business - stay on your own path ... I know you have your own skeletons , so if you do n't want yours to rattle , keep out of other peoples lives . Cabbage - well said : - -RRB-
Cabbage and Xena : I pronounce myself as one of your loyal fans .
edifis , wow , that is not a great thing to do in Saudi .
Ok guys - I do n't want any controversies in this tiny desert . I rest my case . Those two women can go and get themselves knocked for all I care . Goodnight .
Edifis - I would be tolerant if they did n't increase their rates ; -RRB-
Give me animals over humans any day ... .
Saeed I am afraid I am not qualified for that job . Besides there would be no job satisfaction !
But edifis , you would be able to go over the Causeway every weekend , get senselessly drunk and indulge in all kinds of unspeakable pleasures ... !
Do n't speak of that . . who knows next month the other side of the causeway might become a mini Iran !
nomerci . . I am not so sure ... the way things are moving , ca n't say what may happen next ! Btw ... I am currently in saudi . . Until last month I used to go to Bahrain for exit ... But now I would n't dare to go there any more ! This month I will have to come to Doha I think .
Edifis , where in Saudi are you ?
Most of us speak a few languages here , Qatarnewexpat . fa Napoli leccapiedi !
You want them jailed and deported ? How do you guys dealt with prostitutes in your home country ... I wonder where you deport them ? Middle East , Africa , Europe ? :O Seriously , I dont condone prostitution . But we all know that prostitutions in all forms are in every corner of this world . As long as the word `` GREEDY '' do exist in the dictionary , there 's nothing we can do about it . Two people get jailed and deported soon , but 10 people replaced them from different countries and so on . IMO , if they dont really bothers me in my own home at time of my rest , then I should leave them alone -LRB- exeption of criminals , of course -RRB- . The authorities knows very well what 's going on in this country and surely they 're doing their best to dealt w / them . Our job is to do our tasks at work and get paid for that but not to poke our nose to other people 's lives .
Unless you have personal issues with them ? ; -RRB-
Copy pasted story : A man was on his death bed , Someone asked him to give some wise counsel before he departed the world and he Said : `` When I was young I wanted to change the world and solve its problems , As I got older I realized that perhaps I should lower my sights , I thought I would be better served in changing my country . As time went on I realized that people of my country could not be changed . I decided to change the people of my town , but they also did not wish to change , When I reached my old age I thought I would try changing my Family , here also I found my endeavors go to waste , try as I might my family members would not change . `` Now that I am on my death bed , I have realized that if I had sought to improve myself , and removed my own defects , then perhaps my family members would have been influenced . Then seeing the behavior of my family people of my town would have been influenced . By seeing the spiritual change and improvement of the people of my town , the people of my country would have been influenced . And perhaps through the people of my country the world may have been influenced . '' * Source Unknown *
sure here people , this is a thing that only happens in Qatar right ? never happens in India does it FU ?
avatar -- fatty foods kill even more , but that does n't seem to stop the anti-alcohol zealots from waddling up to the take out counter for even more fried food . A drink before and cigarette after are the best THREE things in life . If you have to pay for the middle one along with the other two , then so be it .

Why a Fireman ?

aboy - Dont show your class in a public forum . It 's not good to expose yourself like this . Brite - I offered them the tickets but they still did n't agree.I '' am bothered coz I do n't think it 's right to sell one 's body for whatever reason .
Qatarnewxpat - may I refer you to my previous comment about name-calling being the refuge of the stupid . Oh wait , you 're probably too stupid to get it ... . . But take note Circuit - at least he knows how to spell loser .
No saeedkan , I do n't . Smart versus stupid ? Smart wins every time in my opinion .
May I refer you to your `` owned '' remarks favoring some Idiot over others who actually have something of meaning to say ? Well do not mind him for trying to spell words in his SECOND or THIRD language and he is almost there ... Can you or that monkey count till 10 in any language but English ?
Randomguy yes i have a thought about your thought too . The laws of Qatar is very strange as compared to other places , we all know that . Here you can get away with murder and get prison time for running a street light . What is the definition of crime ? An act of breaking the law . Yes there sometimes is need to differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not , here the crime is not being committed by the ladies alone , its the men that pay for their services as well . There are crimes that hurt others and here they seem to not mind selling their bodies and having a `` blast '' just coz they are getting gifts and having an easy life , so what ? Keep in mind prostitution is the oldest `` profession '' , so if they have no problem in providing this service to better their life then I dont think anyone has the right to question their motives or morals .
Smoke - that was a point put across really well . I see people here are so quick to judge others and their morality . And Smoke to use your own words here `` Let He Who Has Not Sinned Cast The First Stone '' .
As it appears they 're doing it willingly and even enjoying it , I suggest you live and let live . If you do n't like what they 're doing , do n't be their friend . Simple as that .
just shut it dude , it 's none of ur business ... simply !
What ; s your problem unicorn ?? leave the women be . you said it , she is getting a 1,200 QR salary , which is NOTHING in qatar . all she gets is a nissan tida , stop interfering in her personal life , and get one of your own
Read this post http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1659959 and tell me if is normal in your `` stone age '' mentality ? Is normal to rape a young girl about your mind ? Is not more easy , for that guy , to pay a prostitute and solve his problem ????
Marins - you sure are unique ! Did you by any chance get your brain from a museum ? The thread you have mentioned is about CHILD ABUSE and peeple who do such despicable things to children are called paedophiles . They dont go to prostitues . The prey on young children . Your comment on this thread relating to that one has no meaning whatsoever .
How do you people know that I have sinned ?
update required
Chinese Pilipino and East European Prostitutes are all over the place at Ramada , Irish Harp and The InterContinental
Wait till the World Cup nears : o -LRB-
are you talking of `` Prosti Zombies '' or `` Zombies Prosti '' now ???
they are taking the benefits of this post ... hmm
This thread was started by FU a year ago and now he 's gone MIA : - -LRB-
Well , there is a very easy solution to prostitution in ANY place . Men have to stop paying for sex . Simple , non ?
You will know that prostitution has become a serious issue in Qatar when you see a two for one voucher for it in the Entertainer .
The prostitutes and prostitution are NORMAL in any civilizated country.YOU are ABNORMAL , and the most painful thing , is that you are young ! Be fair please , and tell me , how you are solving your sexual problems ? How many times a day you are masturbating , watching porn movies ? Do n't tell me that you are not masturbating , because i will told you , : you are L I A R !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Before to came in Qatar you are living in a cage in your home country , or in a cave ? Pleae believe me , i never seen another rude and narrow-minded , person in my life !!! I have a lot of indian friends , mostly are young and smart , they know to feel the pleasure of a licquor cup and the `` smell and shape '' of a lady body.You are very strange !
marins - I masturbate only when I find a mink wrapped in apricot . How about you ? Can you prove that i ` am narrow minded ? Please try .
ROFL ! What is that ?
I forgot to prove you are or NOT , narrow-mind . If you can understand those thinghs , you are NOT a narrow-mind : 1 -RRB- same gents ladies are human beigns also , and they are FREE to do , what they want , if they do n't disturb other persons ! 2 -RRB- Ladies are our partners in the life , NOT our properties !!! 3 -RRB- - Is strictly forbidden to forbid !!! PS - Sorry for my english , is not my mother language and i NEVER studying it , in the school , with teacher .
It is still on ?
There 's a reply ?
No need reply , just open your eyes and you can see the real world is more coloured than you believe . OK , may be you have a very strictly education , is possible , i dont know , may be in your culture the girls should be virgin at the time of marriage , same as `` offering '' for the `` master man '' , but in the FREE WORLD , those `` values '' are NOTHINGH !!! This is only one of the explanation , why the western world is rich and happy , and the rest of world , asia , africa ... with very rude and stupide religious or non-religious `` rules '' are so poor and backward The FREEDOM is the key my dear friend , the freedom of any people !!! Nobody want be the property of somebody !!! that 's all !!!
FU , let he who has not sinned cast the first stone . I 've not gone through all 3 pages of the comments coz i know somewhere along the road the topic must have diverted to some other direction , but yeah i did read up to the point where you confronted them about their deeds and they said they were having a `` blast '' , so there you have it , problem solved , live and let live . Everyone is here to make a life for themselves , how they do it is up to them to live with .
A 3 line post hits 3 pages ... lol ... FU must be laughing all the way for his another successful post -LRB- by the no . of hits -RRB- ... cool ... he sure knows how to rope in the QLers ... :-RRB-
Happy - good to see you posting buddy . Hope you are doing good .
FU ... I am good ... hope you are doing good too .
Exactly my point !
Hello apple , long time no see ... hope all is well with you ! xoxoxo
Thats right nomerci ! Good point . It 's none of our business to stop people from doing what they want . Let the Qatari police worry about it .
Hi Nomerci , am good hun xoxo : -RRB-
Edifis , you see , I just do n't get those people who run around in a foreign country and are trying to change stuff ... why the heck do they bother ???? I certainly have better things to do with my time .
Well saeedkan , you 're very quick to condemn the women . But surely the men are just as bad ? They too are committing a crime and they too must know that it 's wrong and illegal in this country . Personally , I do n't really care what people get up to , it 's no concern of mine . I think Holland has the right idea - make it completely open and legal .
how dare you imply that local people use prostitutes ! that is just something you have made up , surely ? or is it a well known fact that some of the ` brothers ' can not take ?
yo man ... why fret ... theres always 999 ... cheeez how hard is it for u to use ur noogy ! comon friedunicorn this coming from a veteran like ya ... . ah man !
this is not a dating site , if you want to meet men please go to the mall , do n't ask me out
meh , I am a hypocrite , makes things more entertaining : - p
prostitution is everywhere ... whether rich or poor country . Qatar is not an exception . am not condoning these women but what is the gauge of branding it as prostitution ? -- The jealous are troublesome to others , but a torment to themselves . ~ William Penn , Some Fruits of Solitude , 1693
Prostitution comes in many disguises here in Qatar , it ca n't be stopped .
wow , dogs , jungles , prostitutes , anal pasta , sandcastles and hypoQHRISy . There 's a movie in there somewhere . ` Debbie Does Doha ' .
Probably , the fire alarm in my building has been ringing for 5 minutes now : - -RRB-
Oh I do love a well balanced & reasoned discussion . You 're wiping the floor with them Qhris . Keep it up , very entertaining !
FU I think it is not good to interfere with others personal matters !
Well at least i do n't bitch about everything that happens to me in my day to day life man . Look at you , i have been reading posts on QL for many months and you in specific are among the most annoying people . They did not let you in Irish bar ? Ohhh how can the rest of us sleep now ? . . Get a life dude
... and are we all not the above selling ourselves to make a living or it may be that you are just being selective
So QL is a prostitute too ? But you do n't pay money to QL .
Dude , you 've been reading for months but created a profile just to comment on prostitution , hahaha . Maybe you 're a happy client sticking up for his leading lady ; - -RRB-
Yes i LIKE prostitution . Can I chose to like it sir ? Yes , Maybe I am a happy client . And maybe you are a miserable homo who thinks the world cares about him wining all day .
do you ?
I am honoured that you 're wasted your most embryonic posts on here towards me . It is beautiful . It 's like someone throwing sandcastles at me , wearing pasta home-made jewelery and with crinkle cut hair . Mega .
I just wish one day i have enough time to show up to one of these loser meet ups and most probably you will be there . . I will personally insert that pasta necklace i have in your anus . Although I am quite sure you would enjoy it . Maybe she entered Irish pub and was like . . Wow ! , I can ; t believe i was going to be spotted with this douche ?
I do n't know FriedUnicorn , but I doubt he is jealous of not being with a disease ridden prostitute . Plus that is just a lazy response that a 5 year old gives when you question them , or take affront to a particular action `` you 're just jealous that it is not you '' . Really ? So people can not be disgusted and outraged by something without being jealous . Okay ... Weak argument , and avoids giving a solution .
just believe in KARMA ... God knows our actions all the times . . = P
boy you are posting a very elementary issue ... everywhere there is prostitution ...
Flan was kidding and you guys really latched on to his comment :-RRB- Disgust and pity are two words which come to my mind for these women .
Good deed brings fortune , bad deed brings misfortune .
One solution : make it legal ! And than , enjoy and think of England ! :-RRB- Murphy 's law : the good things in life are imoral , illegal or makes you fat !
Well the guy sounds to be jealous that they seem to be having a good time . Maybe they would be willing to share their Tida with him and he could drive them around and take care of his needs too once in awhile
ahhh FU , you know me well . but i still find it amusing when ppl get upset at my senseless/useless dribble :-RRB-
this is not new to us right ? you can see prostitutes everywhere especially in the rich countries , prostitution is legal and government even ask them to pay tax .
LOL - even my cat has the brain not to get upset by you ... !!!
Shouldnt this have been posted in the how to make lots of money thread LOL
... How it could be possible in a strict Qatar ???
Kumaran - Strict Qatar ? What 's that ? My friend if you look carefully you 'll realize that this happens all the time . I know they are making money coz I know there Salaries .
jealousy 's a curse .
One of them drives a brand new tida and her salary is 1200 QR . How how how ?
In my company , most of the women are bankrolled by a Qatari . Nice cars , nice phone , given some pocket money -LRB- hush money -RRB- , and have to be available when the guy slides up in his Land Cruiser and wants some extra marital loving . Is this prostitution ? The line is blurred , right ? They would say they are in a loving relationship ... and they live , drive and eat beyond their means . It is why they came to the country , to snare a rich Qatari . If you report these women , they 'll just deny and say it is their boyfriend , and that the money is a ` gift ' .
Qhris - But CID can prove that they have multiple boyfriends.Isn ' t it ? Multiple boyfriends giving ` gifts ` is still prostitution .
are ther bothering you ? flan 's comment rings true .
OMG ... . how could it be ... ... ... . FRied Unicorn ... man unbelivable ... is it gift ... ? Then the rules says it is Huram here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey I know , I am not condoning it . It is why my company has tightened up the Visiting Rules -LRB- although they will deny it , and say it was just for ` our safety ' -RRB- ; a constant stream of men entering the accommodations to visit particular women . I do n't know if CID would bother . If these people are advertising then it is a problem , if they are discreet then the country probably does n't even care . Which is a contradiction , obviously .
Fatimah - In case of these women - hopelessness and poverty is not invovlved . It 's greed . Greed of Gadgets and a way of making easy money .
Dear how you know them ? & why you want to stop them ?
Good to see FU 's sentiments are taken seriously on a Friday morning ... : -RRB-
There is open prostituion in some of the bars here mainly for expat use ... and then there is locals ` dating ' expat women on the side while their wives are at home and providing them with a flat and money ... The first one is easy to stop as the police know its going on but choose to do nothing , the second is more difficult and much more controversial ... the local police are probably doing the same things themselves ...
Do n't they prostitutes marry the guy first and then get divorced as soon as the deed is done ? Besides , so long as they are here of their own free will and getting a decent wage they are performing a valuable service to this predominately male society . The UAE is full of them . At least they seem to be more discrete here .
FatimaH , thank you for your kind thoughts and kind heart . Mandi
I once visited the islamic republic of Mars and I found prostitutes openly soliciting in the streets . I did n't complain lest they apply their strict martial laws !
would you expose off their nationality ?
Exiled ... what you said is so true . Some married men prefer their wives to stay at home so they can go b. ... ng around doha .
One time i saw an arab lady , she 's wearing abaya and does n't look like prostitute . Passed by an arab guy and gave away a pc of paper , now that 's i do n't know ... being discreet or what ... it happened at a mall .
FU are you talking about some of the lady sales representatives who happen to live life beyond their means !
In reality are n't all women prostitutes to differing degrees ...
FU are you talking about the girls working as the Sales rep ?
I disagree !
I do n't think it is anyone 's business . Prostitutes bring joy to some people just like QL brings you joy . why do n't you do something more useful rather than judging others .
Even the nuns ? Exiled ?
Uhhh yea you have quite a few shops ... Dulhan , Bombay Silks , Lulu etc etc are some shops where you actually can get some good dresses ... Ok I answered your question about where you would find the dress , now you answer my question , WHERE WOULD YOU ACTUALLY PLAY IN QATAR ??? LOL !
Try in Bombay Silk Centre .
Try PARTHAS ...
Dulhan is good ... but the prices here for those kind of dresses are absurd !!!
thank u all ... she wants it for school function ... . .

Crown relocators , i used them , they are british but also have offices here , all went smooth with them
Great thanks qt & jjj
Hey jjj75 Just googled crown relocators and there are several by that name or similar . Do you have full contact details ? Would be appreciated Thanks
My advice ? Dont use Pickfords ! extra charges when you get here -LRB- I was supposed to have a door to door service -RRB- . Timescale was 40 % longer than agreed on the contract and they dont give a damn when you complain . Not the cheapest either , but I thought they would be worth it . A lesson learned .

Theres no place for gambling here in Doha ...

yes no need visa if the baby is entering doha within 3 months . you just need to carry attested birth certificate of the baby and ID copy of the father
Thanks , the Birth Cert need to be attested by Embassy and Ministry of Forign affairs Qatar , Any idea on this . . ??
You need to have original birth certificate , passport of the baby.The important thing is mother and father should been in permanent visa . On arrival they will stamp the entry visa and you can stamp permanent visa after entering . Attestation is not required .

Phoning in Qatar is almost always unsatisfactory . You got ta go in person . Mandi
Thats a bit of an irony that phoning in Qatar is almost unsatisfactory being that we are trying to get hold of a telecommunications company hahaha
Qatar 2022 slogan is so true :-RRB- Expect amazing
Qtel Call Centre You have to go in person to order and pay for a new service and they will give you a acct num . it takes usually about 2 wks because they have to many projects going on in qatar . If it is a new area , maybe longer if they have to install in the whole complex underground . Once u have paid its ok to call it to inquire when it will be installed Tel : 111 will say enter acct # . - I never have problems getting through anytime . Strange you are having problems .

Panadol is considered safe during pregnancy . Vitamin C wo n't do anything for a cold , so it 's best not to take when you might not know what else is in it .
Just consult with doctor .
panadol yes ... vit c. . . yes . BUT , it is always recommended to consult a doc or at least the pharmacist .
think she should take paracetamol not panadol-check
Panadol = paracetamol = acetaminophen . Good quality Vitamin C is OK , too .
Generally all kind of Medications taken during Pregnancy should be consulted with the Doctor , this does not mean that you can not take any medication . . Pandol is genrally safe and well as Vit C
Yes it is safe to take panadol and vitamin C during pregnancy . but if you are already taking prenatal vitamins then skip vitamin c. .
I think this should be a question for a doctor , not for people you do n't know on a forum !
What is his job & position he received this offer then we can comment . But still you ask about the family living in Qatar I will tell you some facts . As per the present rule your salary should be more than 7000 QR . then only you can apply for family visa . If you want to hire a single bedroom appartment in Qatar you have to pay minimum 5000 QR . Living expenses for a bachelor will be minimum 700/800 QR . per month -LRB- I think -RRB- , then family you can imagine . Qatar is very expensive . Before going to accept any offer from here please re-think twice . Is that suitable for you ? Or consult with any friends or relatives living in Qatar . All the best .
family not possible .   accept or reject offer as per ur financial condition and job designation . for labour salary is around 800 qr along accomodation . Average salary for sacretary is around 4000 qr . therefore , think and decide as per ur condition . normal skilled person can get easily more then 7000 qr .

Well that 's certainly NOT true at the Universities . All degrees are checked and a cpmplete background and security check is done -LRB- not just a police certificate . -RRB- It is very thorough and should be . Mandi
This is actually massively worrying that they are not doing background/police checks !! I mean ... its REALLY worrying , not knowing what sort of person is teaching your child . I mean you see it often in the UK , teachers who have been arrested on child pornography charges , and this is WITH the police checking !!
My partner did comment on how ` trusting ' the nursery appeared compared to the UK where a newly employed person cant be left with kids without being supervised by existing staff for several months . Best thing to do is ask the place what they do and visit it to get a feel .
No , Teachers over here are taken purely on CV and interview . There are no police checks done in most cases . Most schools say they do checks but as Qatar has no juridisction , how can they ? As I say , they do n't do checks and neither do they check qualifications -LRB- that 's in certain schools -RRB- . Anybody that can prove otherwise , feel free .

The Internet connection which comes with Mozaic TV is fairly good and relatively continuous . The speed vary all the time depending upon the use of Internet of the other customers . Anyway , it is the best you can get for this amount . The quality of TV programs is worse than what you can have with a simple digital receiver -LRB- costs about 120 QR and 0 QR per month -RRB- . Furthermore , the numbers of channels provided by Mozaic -LRB- without any extra package included -RRB- is very restricted , compair to above mentioned receiver .
Roadkill , on the main road to Saudi
Mozaic TV + is awazing as it will cost u low and also for 1st 2 months its fantastic after tht u will only get ur basic package and in this package u wil not find many gud channels ... the reason i hav mozaic because of sports u will have to subscribe to sports package for cricket or football for QR 30 per month to get all time live sports n thts quite cheap ... with other recievers have to buy card n use it and its headache ... Mozaic is gud with internet ... i recommend you to go for it thanks
yes . . mozaic TV is good . but internet connection is 10 % slower than only ADSL connection without mozaicTV . but for picture quality , for me it is good . as clear as below picture . <imgÂ src=http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs130.snc1/5600_148522640534_112811245534_3783123_5922169_n.jpgÂ alt=kampungÂ sampireunÂ garutÂ indonesiaÂ width=400Â height=250Â /> <imgÂ src=http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs130.snc1/5600_148511790534_112811245534_3783024_8265078_n.jpgÂ alt=kampungÂ sampireunÂ garutÂ indonesiaÂ width=400Â height=250Â /> <imgÂ src=http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs635.snc3/31871_425360670534_112811245534_5790539_3651513_n.jpgÂ alt=kampungÂ sampireunÂ garutÂ indonesiaÂ width=300Â height=400Â /> <imgÂ src=http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash1/hs483.ash1/26455_364767820534_112811245534_5213916_2750592_n.jpgÂ alt=kampungÂ sampireunÂ garutÂ indonesiaÂ width=400Â height=250Â /> <imgÂ src=http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs483.snc3/26455_364767800534_112811245534_5213915_4922275_n.jpgÂ alt=kampungÂ sampireunÂ garutÂ indonesiaÂ width=400Â height=250Â /> <imgÂ src=http://www.itravelindonesia.com/hotel/java/images/bromo-semeru-low-clouds.jpgÂ alt=kampungÂ sampireunÂ garutÂ indonesiaÂ width=400Â height=250Â />
Mozaic TV + is a good option.It is cheap and the internet speed is also good.Also all the channels are free for 02 months apart from your package.I am using Aisan package and it is a better option here in Qatar .
Gulf Greetings have big stuffed toys , they also got a camel one . .
Gulf Greetings -- good idea , is this in Villagio ? Or just City Center/Landmark ? Second answer -- what is the store 's name that you are talking about ? Thanks for your help !
`` Where can I get big stuffed animals , like a camel ? '' Try a Landcruiser Just kiddin . . could not resist it : -RRB-
If I were you I would enjoy my life until you get that call from the devil .
Well friends ... I have been recently laid off from a Q-company due to restructuring and so that is why I am desperate to find a job . News about jobs etc that all see everywhere is not true . There are strange things also happening ... ... . .
1 year , or may be more ... Good Luck
Y dont you keep trying for other jobs ... dont wait for them to call you ...
QR is such a huge company that your application will not always get notcied by applying online . I suggest calling the recruitment department and speaking to the person in charge of the position -LRB- department -RRB- you are applying for . Otherwise you might be waiting forever . This worked for me .
Well some of my colleagues have been loosing their jobs on and off during the past two years and their company blames it on recession , lack of business , lack of new contracts and so on and when one my colleagues suggested to them the idea of just changing some of the managers and some of the mangement so that new guys could come in with new ideas and a new outlook they just put him on a plane real quick without a release letter nor an NOC .
can be extremely cold with lots of snow and ice
very cold but the environment is pretty much exciting spedcially december holidays ! . . enjoy !
ohhh i would love to go there ...

-LRB- at least I had both -RRB- WIFI and cable connection . For food and some shopping there are a few places around . However the big shopping/markets/stores is a Taxi ride away . Regards !!
is fully furnished even you might get towels , bed sheets and some cover . -LRB- however always get your own towels and bed sheets , at least that 's what I have learned so far -RRB- Fully furnished means everything : beds , chairs , sofas , TV , even some kitchen tools . Location is fine , gym is excellent , and pool is amazing . The apts are comfortable ones . Regards !!
Thats great to hear ! Are there any malls / Shops near by for food and stuff ! Actually above looks good ! thanks for the help Regards
no pillows and bed cover rest everything , lulu supermarket is near by but you will not get any food.for that nearby place is food palace
Hey one more thing important , Do they provide Wifi or only cable net ? Let me know , bec if they dont provide Wifi -LRB- wireless -RRB- then i need to bring my router along .
whats in ... i was not allowed o go in
he he he @ honeybunch that was a nice one ... i hope lot many QLrs must be staying in & pearls or near by . may be they can tell me all the above stuff . . Thanks man !
Best thing to do is give the school a try and get your son on other school 's lists as soon as possible . If it turns out you like ACS , then no harm done .
<P> My my , I know this discussion is a bit old but stumbbled on it today ... ag shame the lady only wanted to know if anyone has some constructive , true advise to give her . You have obviously nothing better to do than to carry on and on and on with this . . you need to get a life and a break from Qatar mate/s !!!! </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Ek is so jammer dat jy al die gemors van die mense hier in Doha moet hoer ... jy sal in die einde jou eie besluit moet maak . . sorry my Afrikaans is not so fantastic anymore so I will carry on in English ... -LRB- apology for presuming that you DO speak it and you do n't ... -RRB- . . just something to make them wonder !!! heheh </P> <P> to answer your question ... it follows the american system and the IB - programme . make sure that if your company are paying the fees that they will cover it ... yes there are some schools better than others . . but hey it all depends on where you will be living as the traffic here is quite incredible . . so you will have to maybe plan around that . . have a look on this site to see a list of all the international schools - http://www.onlineqatar.com/education/international-schools.aspx&nbsp;&nbsp; </P> <P> I am asuming you already have done that ... and yes others are more difficult to get into than others . . but if you put your name down at all the schools that you are interested in , you have to pay a registration fee and you do n't get that back if you decide not to go to that school . . so it is a hard one this . . I will hope that all goes well with you !!! You are more that welcome to contact me again . Good luck !!!! </P>
It 's that time of the year when new comers to Qatar begin exploring schools for their children . Good luck with it all . It is not an easy process . But I think it would be more helpful if people spoke from personal experience and based on evidence . Impressions and second hand information can be misleading . BTW , my kids go to Sherborne , and I am pleased with it . I do n't think it will be comparable to the Dorset school . It ca n't be , and I do n't judge it on that basis . I judge it on the curriculum , staff , activities , interaction with parents , etc. . As for fees , while it is not cheap , it is less expensive than Compass , ASD , and ACS Doha . I think DESS is subsidized , right ? Good luck with ACS and when you 've gone through the experience , please write about it . I am sure many people will want to know .
<p> DohaExplorer -- do you know much about Sherborne 's association with the boarding school in England ? Is the campus in Doha essentially a branch or is it just licensing the name ? </p>
Dintovich ... what do you mean about `` being honest '' ? I have nothing to hide whatsoever . And we are very happy with the school my children go to , I have no reason to consider change . But , if I were , then `` rich kids '' would certainly not be a deterrent for me . Although , except for some Qatari children , i have not seen any rich kids here .
you are right kiwinyc . it seems like Dintovitch does have a very large chip indeed which makes me suspicious about how genuine the comments are . perhaps the fees are too high for them , or their kids did not get in when they applied or they are they elsewhere and are worried about some of these new up and coming schools taking away students . might go and have a look at sherborne myself so there is your answer Dintovitch , my children are not at sherborne but i have heard many good things about it . now answer expatlady .
In a court of law the judge does not examine the motives of why a witness says this or that but looks at what has been said ; is it or could it be true or false ? If we start on the road of why somebody says something or another we will end up nowhere . I could for example retort by asking why , you out there , are you trying to protect Sherborne-Qatar and I could go into theorizing about you perhaps being British and want to protect your national school or your kids are in that school and you want to justify your decision for taking them there or many large number of possible motives . If we go along this road there will be no end to the discussion . Let us instead try to be rational and confine ourselves to facts and not to what is in the hearts and can not be seen . It does n't really matter whether I have a chip on my shoulder or not -LRB- you will never find out -RRB- , what matters is ; what I have said about Sherborne-Qatar , is it or could it be true or false ? This is what we should look at . Also , when I say `` spoilt rich kids '' I do n't mean they are spoilt because they are rich per se , no , those unfortunate kids are the kind that have been brought up mostly not by their parents but by the maids -LRB- not even trained nannies -RRB- who are in the palaces . And regarding this point the same will apply to ACS Doha . Another point needs clearing ; I did not say that Sherborne-Qatar is bad as teaching goes -LRB- but it could be bad for your kid because of the demographics . -RRB- I said that it will never be like Sherborne-UK because the raison d'etre for Sherborne-Qatar is different from that for Sherborne-UK . Sherborne-Qatar has shareholders who will siphon money away from it unlike Sherborne-UK . Please also remember that Sherborne-UK is only a secondary boarding school which means Sherborne is new in the primary school field . Why did they start with primary school in Qatar ? Is it because it is a bigger market ?
Sherborne Prep in Dorset was established in 1858 for students from aged 3 - 13 years - therefore I think they have some primary school experience . It runs alongside Sherborne Boys and Sherborne Girls Senior Schools . They also have an international school in the UK which prepares overseas students for entry into their main schools . The schools are both day and boarding . There is a clear understanding and acceptance that Sherborne Qatar wishes to establish its own identity whilst keeping some of the values from the ` mother school .
If you google `` Sherborne Prep in Dorset '' you will find that it has nothing to do with the 560 years old Sherbone-UK . It just has the name Sherborne by virtue of being in Sherborne town . If you visit Sherborne-UK website you will find that the only link they have is Sherborne-Qatar . Also the schools ' logos are different . As for the International School that prepares overseas students for entry into the main Sherborne , I know nothing about and I do n't know whether it even exists . If it does I am sure it is totally separate from the main Sherborne that we know . It could be a private school that has thought of exploiting the niche of preparing students to the main Sherborne . So , I stand by what I said earlier that they have not managed a primary or a prep school before ! I am not saying this makes then inadiquate , no , I do n't know about that , but just that they were willing to undergo such an experience for the sake of financially supporting Sherborne-UK . You will get just as good an education , if not better for your kids somewhere else , cheaper and without being hit by the demographics I mentioned earlier .
Wow . I did n't realize . Thanks for the post Dintovitch .
Not only that it will never be the same as Sherborne in the UK because of the spoilt rich kids but also because here in Qatar Sherborne is for profit unlike its sister in the UK because a -RRB- they have a Qatari partner to whom they should pay dividends and b -RRB- part of the extra money they make goes to support the true Sherborne in the UK which is facing some financial difficulties ; why do you think they are here in the first place !? You are right AngelinaBallerina , Sherbornr-Qatar can never be as Sherborne-UK . All in all I think Sherborne-Qatar will mar the name and the old academic tradition of Sherborne-UK .
Dintovich , I have children in school here . I have not seen many `` spoilt , rich kids '' that mar the reputation of our school ... what kind of people are you actually talking about ???
Whatever next ` Oxford University Qatar ' ?? Shrewsbury School Qatar ?? Marlborough College Qatar ... . Nahhhh ...
@ nomerci Look , all I am saying is that the raison d'etre for Sherborne-Qatar is not the same as that for Sherborne-UK for which you have taken your child in the first place . Sherborne-Qatar was originally founded in order to provide dividends for its f
Hey nomerci , where were your children before you took them to Sherborne-Qatar ?
Dinovitch , ok , I have no idea about that school , so I take your word for it . Although , I know of a few parents and students who seem to like the school .
Thank you nomerci for being honest ! Good luck to your children wherever they are but do n't take them there !
Where do your children go to school Dintovitch
They are well-established in the UK - you can see their website here http://www.acs-schools.com/acs-doha.aspx I have toured the campus and have to say it 's quite impressive . My son is at Compass , which I am quite happy with , but you wo n't go wrong with ACS-Doha either . Here 's some info from their website : The Programme Initially we will be offering our prestigious Early Years , Lower School , and Middle School curriculums , based on globally recognised American and international standards , with an aim to deliver the same range of academic programmes successfully offered at our three UK campuses -LSB- learn more -RSB- . As the campus develops a High School we will also seek authorisation to offer prestigious US College Board Advanced Placement -LRB- AP -RRB- courses . ACS Doha will also offer an American High School Honours Diploma . The school will shortly be a member of the Council of International Schools . The Doha campus offers a rigorous academic curriculum of English , mathematics , science , humanities , world languages , and fine arts . Our programme challenges students to become independent , reflective , inquiring , and knowledgeable ; confident communicators who are principled , open-minded and caring ; socially and emotionally intelligent and able to embrace the importance of a healthy and balanced lifestyle .
Be careful , it is one where spoiled rich children with bad habits and manners conglomerate . Because it is so overpriced and because of its location it would attract mostly these types . Remember ; your child will learn more from his peers than from his teachers . There are still many good schools where your child will much happier . Take Sherborne which is a very good school in the UK I hear but here in Qatar it is suffering from the same problem I mentined above !
well my children are not spoilt , dont have bad manners , havent any bad habits you would worry about and we are not rich - neither are their friends of which they have many . For you information children learn first and foremost from their parents and taking into consideration your highly critical letter I am trying to picture your children , if you have any of course . If parents bring up their children well enough , they will not be affected so much by negative peer pressure whatever school they are in .
Hello d-esertmum Where are your kids ? How can you be not rich and have your kids attend one of these schools ? And if the company is paying the fees then your salary must be quite high . ACS Doha has not started yet anyway , so do your kids go to Sherborne ? Hope to hear from you because I disagree that kids do n't learn much from their peers ; peer pressure is a strong force !
sorry i prefer not enter into such arguments . you are entitled to your opinion and I likewise . I am just saying my peace . i hope you are happy with where your kids are at school . i am and thats all that matters to me .
We are only trying to help someone decide on a matter that will affect the future of her children . If you say things along those lines then I think you should substantiate it . You responded to my first comment as though I did n't know what I was talking about and when I responded back , you said you did n't want to discuss the matter ! I think this is unfair ! Why did you challenge my opinion in the first place ?!
Help someone ? Really ? Bye Dintovitch !
I am sorry but I thought you were trying to help this mum make a decision ! Bye to you too !
I am sorry but I thought you were trying to help this mum make a decision ! Bye to you too !
If I come to Doha for vizit my husband like a turist , can I stay longer and extend my viza every month ? or I have to apply for family viza ?
I am totally confused
Of course for me . . my husband has viza , his company extending for him . .
it does n't take much time for extension of visit visa , if you have not exceeded six months , despite some cases after requisition to the officer ... you may get the 7th month .
Thank you very much for information . .
Tourist , visitor ... Is n't it the same ?
My wife made the entry on 18th Sep , So shall I go and extend her visit visa on 18th Octo or Do I need to go before the end date ? Do I need to show them the extended return ticket also ?

Thanks for your comments so far guys . Just to let you know I always clean up after him and he does not bark at anyone . I would not trust any dog to be let off the lead ... well not over here anyway so he will always be by my side :--RRB- I enjoy a walk down the Corniche and wanted my new dog to enjoy the same .
I beg to difer . . i have seen some real dogs at the corniche . . Ruffffffffffffffff !
:-RRB- Brit . That 's probabaly true but as far as I know dogs are not allowed in the Corniche , parks and other public places in Qatar . Most people who have dogs in Qatar walk them on isolated beaches and empty spaces near their houses . Please ask Xena/Chelsea/QAWS people about this . Dont get into trouble by walking them at places where they are not allowed . `` Ali Baba and 40 thieves '' are now `` Ali Baba and 30 thieves '' ; 10 were laid off .
Its unfortunate but dogs are not allowed on the corniche and even other small parks in neighborhoods . Its not a dog friendly country ! Also be careful if you are by a beach and you let a dog off leash chances are someone in a car will get close to it and steal it happened to friends of mine .
... that we are not allowed to walk dogs on the Corniche . What harm can that do ? Another minus point for this country , to add to many others already .
I agree with you Alumnar , not a lot you can do !
just pretend as if the dog is walking you and no one will have any problem ! I do n't think Corniche is off limits to dogs , but make sure the dog is with a leash . .
I just LOVE the idea that the dog is walking you !!! I would love to be there if somebody walking a dog is approached and told off and uses that as a response ... I bet that will take a while to sink in ! Thank you for the good laugh !
I do n't know about signs , but I have seen a couple of people walking their dogs there . . just remember not to leave any doo-doo behind :-RRB-
No problem mate , just be sure your dog is not barking or he will not bite someone . <aÂ href=http://www.danasoft.com> <imgÂ src=http://www.danasoft.com/sig/381129.jpgÂ border=0> </a> <divÂ style=font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:11px;> <imgÂ src=http://i41.tinypic.com/15xppg9.jpg>
since u have just adopted the pup , as jaredboy sugested of no barking/biting , teach the pup of not barking/biting in public places , avoid walking late evenings as lot of kids walking freely of all nationalities , so that some cranky parents object .
I think the corniche is off limits to dogs . `` Ali Baba and 40 thieves '' are now `` Ali Baba and 30 thieves '' ; 10 were laid off .
Nothing is more relaxing than flying like an Eagle in Heaven !! It s not allowed . not allowed to take ur pets to the cornishe , not allowed to fish there , not allowed to swim there , not allowed to ride bicycle . and if the police catch u doin any , i think the fine is 600 QR . am sure bekoz we took the puppy with us when i was with my friend and the police stop us and ask us to take the dog away . honestly we didnt know that its not allowed and he explained to us the above mentioned .
I moved to a house in ALnasr st. , but my neighbor is having a place besides my window , He uses this place for chicken , and house birds which makes a very bad smell , and dirt , Is that acceptable by law ? A H M E D F A T H E Y
I was just down there yesterday . It seems as though there are certain areas with a sign that says no dogs and other areas that do n't . I 'm not sure if this means it applies to all areas of the corniche or just the ones that explicitly say so . Then again the police are the ones enforcing it and they may be ignorant as well .
You will be stopped eventually . It wo n't be the Arabs that stop you , it is the Indians that hates dogs . They seem them as dirty ; which is shocking as most Indians do n't wash their hands and spit in the street .
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT ??????????????????? please tell me when you 'll be at corniche with your dog so i reschedule sincerely cynophobic Yalla !
how do know if they are processing your visa if you dont have there contact info ? did you talk to the HR person verbally ? i 'm confused . . try this link below sana maka tulong ; Momenta Qatar PO Box 6002 Doha , Qatar Phone : +974Â 4247113 Fax : +974Â 4413565 or go to this link ; http://www.momentaglobal.com/contact_us.php
Momenta ?! i hope you do n't regret laters !
Actually I have an agency here in the Phils its Centaur Manpower . They dont ive us updates but we already paid them after finishing the medical last May 7 , everytime we contact them they told us that your papers are on process , just wait . Thats all . But its almost 3 months already so Im worried .
nothing new when u speak abt momenta . . !! keep tracing !
call your local agency 100x a day . . or else call mike enriquez . . btw how much did you pay to that agency ?
Hi , in my case it 's took long before they process all the required documents . in my company even you have completed all the requirements then if no available visa , then the applicant need to wait before they can issued a visa . for me its almost 9 Months processing . my employer hired me since october 2011 , but i just arrived here in doha last month , imagine how long is the processing . by the way , i am working in a government .
thnx Nomerci for the Advice i will post the info on QAWS page
Could you please send me an email to contact@qaws.org with this pic attached and let me know which area you found the dog and your contact number . We can start to find the owner and hopefully re-unite him or her . Can you also email me your address because we 'd like to come round and scan him to see if he has a microchip which will tell us who his owners are . Thanks !
Dogs in Doha has an FB page you could contact them on and a website www.dogsindoha.weebly.com They always publish lost and found doggies Good luck
The Vets also are a good source to find the owner see if they have him listed in their files , but QAWS is the best bet , I put up signs for my dog at grocery stores , vets and QAWS .
i love dogssss ... can i have it?i will take care of it . . thanks
such a lovely dog !!! just keep it for the meantime until someone will look for it . .
The Veterinary Surgery - 4436 7187 Qatar Veterinary Centre - 4421 6405
first ask people who live around you and take it to vet . maybe it carry disease that 's why the owner freed it .
That 's not `` freeing '' it ABM , that 's abandoning it - a very cruel thing to do . In many countries itwould be considered a crime , in all countries it 's morally reprehensible . He does look cute and I 'm sure if you do n't find his original owner he 'll find a good home quickly . Thank you for looking after him and for trying to find his owner if they are indeed lookig for him
He is problably lost . Please contact QAWS , Xena here on QL can help you .
its he , wallah i dont know . : -RRB-
Awww cute . I do n't know ask around I guess maybe put up a sign ? He could be abandoned by a expriate perhaps . I say keep him for now . I mean you wo n't know what will happen to him if you do n't . It would sad to see something happen to such a adorable pup .
Thnx for the Advice . . It/He is realy lovely and friendly he sleeping in my room now actually so lets wait and see wut is next ; -RRB-
Here is the contact to QAWS , they will know what to do , and the owner of the dog will most probably contact them http://www.qaws.org/news/news.php

What 's your nationality and Visa status and Sex ?
Sorry No issue in Visa . I need to know only the pre-depature formalities .
how was the maid employed?through agency or directly from Srilanka ? If you have not given any guarantees to Srilankan embassy in Qatar , then you just have to cancel her RP and make sure you keep the original copy of the cancellation as a proof that your maid left Qatar and so you can bring anothermaid later on .
Yes . I am looking for to bring new maid .
Hi , i have approved housemaid visa for Sri Lankan . . i 'm a filipino and i need someone to exchange with . . Please call me 33237997 . . Thanks !
I always say , if you are in true love , you dont need to ask possibilities . Goodluck dear .
yup u can . .
thir is no rolls says its not allwoed yes go ahead do it and wish both of you good life
Best of luck friend , in either way you should follow the right procedure and respect the law . contact AWQAF i am sure they will help in your case .
<p> I have heard plenty about this company from colleagues and yes it is a real company but reputable ... that 's a stretch . First of all , they pay the employees in cash - red flags red flags , second , they only have 1 native english speaker for an english teacher ... I do n't think the post above is accurate about Ras Gas using them for anything ... </p> <p> </p>
Best to buy on-line . Mandi
I am traveling in 16th June , so if I bought it online it will take time to send me it throw mail I wan na know if any office here selling this euro-pass it will be better
Whatever you buy you should be able to print out . Or have them send Fedex . Mandi
hey , my suggestion would be to buy the Euro Rail pass from there itself ! yes , i did it when I was going from Berlin to Amsterdam , I took a 3-way euro-rail pass , and got 5 cross-country travel . And it just takes 5 minutes at the ticketing counter , tell them your plan , and they assist you better . . Regarding buses , you can get a travel card seperately for these 3 countries from the bus itself i think , or near to or in the train stations , they have a ticketing booth i guess hope that helps . . good luck and bon bon voyage !
Google it you 'll get all the information . You cant get it from Doha you can purchase online .
Thanks every body for your help and your interest
My friend , without basic training you can not directly go for a driving test . Only US and European license holders can directly apply for a test . Indian or even a M.E license is not considered for direct test . The basic course will cost you near about QR 600 / - Good Luck
technically , yes you can ! But I would advice you to take even a short refresher `` practice '' of the actual test so you 'll be familiar with the venue and manner of test driving !
Technically yes you can have 2 atempts for a direct test but you will never be able to clear , i sugest to take short cource before you give test , it will clear you in one shot . All the best
You are right ... In this case , NOC is must .
that if you have no NOC then you need to wait 2 years before you are eligible to get a new job in Qatar . Expect Amazing !
ouch ! so there 's no other way ? :-LRB- even if my contract is finished ? : -LRB-
that 's a sad truth . . qatar is a nice place to work at . :-LRB- . was there an article before in a newspaper that companies were to give their employees NOCs ? or are they pertaining to selected companies only ?
Is it something that is included in Koran , or is it a cultural value ?
If that one is really a muslim country , then none .
NONE ! Both are against SHARIA LAW .
There is always a reason why things are forbidden in sharia law and its for the good of whole mankind .
none , because both case will destroy the society , by stopping the normal human behavior to marry and give birth to offsprings ... . . common sense ...

i read once that kwuit are having a problem with the bedwen there and they are refusing to give them the citizenship . SO HOW they will give it to the expatriates ???
Of course the authorities in Qatar will soon be giving free Qatari citizenship to all of the expatriate workers , especially if they are from the Phillippines , Pakistan and Nepal . There will also be free beer , subsidized pork sausages , an early Christmas every year , no road accidents in Doha and no school fees . Why do n't you grow up , Pilo_111 ?

IT IS ILLEGAL SHARIA LAW http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/06/03/24/10027928.html The Sharia : How it affects you By Bassma Al Jandaly , Staff Reporter Published : November 02 , 2007 , 01:19 You could be sharing an apartment with a friend of the opposite sex . And the arrangement could be innocent , purely for financial reasons . But in the eyes of Sharia law you are committing an offence . More and more people are being punished because they claim they were unaware of the law and its clauses . There are hundreds of cases such as these that emerge each year either from the police or the courts . An increasing number of men and women , who are not blood relatives nor legally married , and have shared a flat , room or even sat in tinted cars , are being jailed and deported , a lawyer said . These men and women have shared no relationship . Dr Adel Khamis Al Mimari from Al Itazan Consultant and Advocates said they are being punished in accordance with Sharia law . The clause is known as `` Tawajed '' or `` Tahseen Al Ma'asiya '' . These couples have been punished under this clause : sharing a closed place and encouraging sin even though they shared no relationship . He told Gulf News : `` The bottom line is awareness . Many foreigners are not familiar with Sharia law and hence they are punished . If these couples go unnoticed , then there is no trouble . But if the authorities for some reason or another know they are sharing a ? closed space ' they can be punished . This is the law . '' All about respect `` These couples believe they are leading a normal life , like they would in their home countries . But this is considered a sin here . Filipino nationals top the list of nationalities who fall into this trap followed by Indians , Europeans and Chinese . People should be educated about this issue to avoid problems . '' Dr Ahmad Al Qubaisi , a leading Islamic scholar , told Gulf News that every nation has its culture and traditions . Each nation should respect others . `` Westerners respect each other and they know their countries ' traditions and laws . So why when it comes to Muslims they claim that they do not know anything about the traditions and culture ? The West knows well that Muslims , like Hindus , Christians and Jews , have their culture and traditions . They should respect our religion , '' Dr Al Qubaisi said . The tradition `` Our tradition is against a man and woman , who are not legally related , mingling privately or being in a closed place alone , while in the West they can have a sexual relationship even though they are not married . Our traditions are very different , '' Dr Al Qubaisi said . `` We see many such cases of foreign men and women in courts . They say they do not know the traditions and religion here . They should know and respect our tradition the same way we respect their tradition and religion , '' he said . The sentence Dr Khalifa Rashid Al Sha'ali , Dean of the Faculty of Law at Ajman University , said if a man and a woman who are not related are caught alone in a private place , they face a jail sentence or lashes even if they were not involved in any suspicious act . It is up to the judge 's discretion to decide whether they should be deported . Dr Al Sha'ali , a former Ajman Police Chief , told Gulf News that during his tenure , he dealt with several such cases . Mohammad Yousuf , Deputy Director of the Dubai Courts Department , said while the Federal punitive law is implemented in the UAE , the situation is different in Dubai . The Tawajed or Tahseen Al Ma'asiya clause , he said , is not implemented in Dubai . Sultan Khalifa Bin Bakheet Al Matroushi , Chairman of the Ajman Federal Appeal Court , said if a man and woman are sitting alone in the work place or in front of people , they will not be charged . If they are found in a bedroom or in a house or car and the circumstances are suspicious , they will face charges even if they have not committed adultery . The couple can also be deported , he said . Justice minister explains the law Mohammad Bin Nakhira Al Daheri , Minister of Justice , told Gulf News that according to Sharia , if a man and woman are found in a closed place alone they may get arrested , but he gave an assurance that they are held for good reason . He stressed that the police would investigate first . `` If a couple is found alone in a closed place such as a house , room or car they may face legal action . There also must be a complaint against them . However , if their actions are not against public morals such as being in their work place or inside a lift , of course no action would be taken . If police receive a tip that a man and woman are in a closed place , they will investigate and if they are not doing anything against the law they will not be punished . `` There must be a complaint and investigation from police . The public prosecution and the judge can decide if something illegal was going on , '' Al Daheri said . What the people say Kristina from Macedonia has been living in the UAE for the last six months . She said she has no idea about Sharia law or the clause , which prohibits men and women , who are not blood relatives nor legally married , from sharing a flat , room or even sitting in tinted cars . `` People must have privacy . It is strange that a neighbour or a watchman can call the police if two people are in a private place alone . Why do n't people call the police when they hear someone beating up his wife at home ? `` Many of us here are not Muslims . We respect Islam and the traditions of this land . Hence , our way of life should also be respected . '' She said it is the responsibility of companies who hire people from abroad to make them aware about Sharia . `` This law does not exist in my country , where it is normal to be with your boyfriend alone in a closed place . I think if companies alert people before they come here , it will help them . '' Mohammad Elias from India is in his 20s and not married . He has been in the UAE for two months , but says he has never heard about the clause . `` I may not agree with the clause , but I do respect the law of the land here , and I think foreigners should adhere to the law , '' he said . Tess Yema from the Philippines works as a teacher in a school in Sharjah and has been here since August . `` I am aware of the law . I have a brother-in-law who has been in the UAE for many years . He told me about the clause . `` Before coming to the UAE , the authorities in my country told me about Sharia . I knew these aspects very well before coming here . I respect the law in this country and I respect their way of thinking even if it is different from the one in my country , '' Yema said . `` I was even told about the dress code here . I knew that if I offended the law I would face punishment , '' she said . Samer Assaf is married with two daughters . His family is in Syria . `` I have been living here for more than 15 years , but I have never heard about this clause , not in my country and not here . I am a Christian , but I respect the traditions and customs of others . '' Lucia Alinea from the Philippines , has been in the UAE for a few months only , but she is well aware of the clause . `` My brother has been here for many years and he is aware of the Sharia law . `` I tried to learn as much about the customs and traditions here before leaving the Philippines . We have to respect the law here or anywhere , '' said Lucia , who is a teacher in a private school in Sharjah .
IT IS NOT ALLOWED ... we have to respect Qatari Rules though for practical reasons we need to have a sharing accommodation ...
we have to respect Qatari Rules though for practical reasons we need to have a sharing accommodation ... IT IS NOT ALLOWED ...
It is officiay not allowed . BUT . As long as there is no indecent behaviour in and around , then it is okay
Theres another options . But the reality is that a lot of people live like this in Doha . No problem at all , unless you got busted or pointed out . Nobody is gon na ask your marriage certificate , unless you try to book a hotel room.Book 2 and you wont have any problems.LOL
Is , its simple . The answer is no .
a lot of western couples live together and do n't seem to be bothered by the law , however it is playing russian roulette to try , when at any time u can be arrested . see attached story from gulf times today : Kissing lands couple in trouble By Nour Abuzant A MARRIED couple was sentenced in absentia to a year in prison for kissing in public and conducting an illicit relationship . The Muslim woman and her Christian husband , both from Lebanon , skipped the country before the trial concluded after being told the State did not recognise their marriage , which took place in Cyprus . Despite their inter-faith union not being an issue in their home country , Doha authorities ruled it unlawful even though the woman was apparently given a residence visa based on the sponsorship of her husband . The couple landed in trouble after a Qatari family called the police to complain they were kissing on the Corniche in April . The police officer who attended the call said he found the two in an indecent position and when he confronted them , the woman screamed that they were married . The officer insisted that their marital status bore no relevance to the offence . During interrogation , the arrested man , 27 , claimed he had done nothing more than place his hand on the shoulder of his 24-year-old wife who had arrived in Qatar 10 days earlier . She told the public prosecution that she did not realise that such an act was illegal in Qatar . It was during their trial that the tricky subject of the pairs marriage came up for debate . The couple presented their marriage certificate to the court . However , it was ruled to be invalid in Qatar . The court admitted that a residence visa had been issued based on the fact that the two were husband and wife , but the country had the right to cancel that at any time if information came to light requiring such action . The court also admitted there was no evidence of malicious intent to hide the couples differing religions and that their documents were authentic . However , the court made it clear that Qatar could not accept the marriage within the constraints of its own laws . The couples lawyer said there would be no appeal lodged against the verdict as his clients had left the country after a travel ban had been lifted .
What 's the confusion ? It is illegal . Are you asking if people break the law ? There may be those who do , and there may be those who get away with it for a period of time . Is it a good idea ? Not really . You do n't want to be embroiled in a legal system with which you are not familiar .
`` An increasing number of men and women , who are not blood relatives nor legally married , and have shared a flat , room or even sat in tinted cars , are being jailed and deported '' sad but true , if you do n't want to end up in jail or be deported ... better share your room or your accommodation with same sex ... we are expats , we should respect the law no matter how cruel it is
error
still not ok
yeh be careful , i recently heard a guy changed and during changing they just cancalled his RP adn sent him back , he was born and bought up here , by the way what si the root cause of this ?
First and foremost you will need to have a sponsor and then a partner .

Ramada Signal head towards D-Ring Road which becomes Shamal Road as you travel north . At around 70km north of Doha , I cant remember the exact junction number you will get the sign for Zubarah . Another 20km west from there . There is a nice stretch of Beach close by . Nothing else to see apart from that !
Thanks Mates . -LRB- :
There is also a nice drive down the north-west coast , so you can go all the way to the top of Qatar on the North/Al Shamal Road , then turn left and follow the road down to Zubara .
Its Jaida and not Jida that 's why you could n't find it . . : -RRB-
if ur travelling from ponderosa u might wan na consider going straight towards ramada being on ur right on the same salwa road till u reach a bridge thats called jaidah bridge
But you have to cross the bridge to get to the Home Center !

Yes , I went to a concert once . Not my fave group though .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3sco1hCMmQ `` Poor Mans Moody Blues '' Great song but it does vaguely resemble `` Nights in White Satin '' - the joke was that this song was written after a critic dubbed them the `` Poor Man 's Moody Blues '' get it
No Merci and Dracula ... you made my day although it is about to end ... I never thought I would get a reply from anyone . No Merci , they are my favourite pop group ... i know most of their songs by heart . You are lucky to have been to their concert ... I will never get that chance ... they are too old now . . Dracula , are you a fan ? U right ... it does sound like Nights in White Satin ... only the chorus ... What are your favorite pop groups , btw ?
Whoa ! ... never thought i 'd see anyone mention Barclay James Harvest on QL ! ... used to listen to them a lot in my university days , still do occasionally ... they were tipped to be the next Pink Floyd if they did n't disband as quickly as they did , do n't know about that but good sound no doubt ...
Wow Gadarene ... I am really happy I got a third response ... right now I am listening to them on You Tube after Dracula sent me a link ... If I get 10 people like you , Dracula and No Merci , I might organise a BJH night and we can all sing their songs ... if you want I can give you over 50 songs that I have ... I listen to them everyday ... my 10 year old boy is starting to sing their songs too and he loves `` John Lennon 's Guitar ''
Enjoy your two years vacation !!! No changes so far .
Ban is still 2 yrs . No change has been officially published or notified by authorities . Regards !!
wait for 1 year and 3 months more .
Yes we ahve the RP for my wife . We do n't have the ID card yet because the stopped issuing them due to the new ones with the computer chip coming out next month or so . I hope this does n't delay anything . As always thanks for the answers . I really do appreciate the help .
That why I was wondering . I do n't work for a Qatar Company . My `` company '' is primarily in business to sponser people here . Thanks again for the help .

better use safari or Firefox . <imgÂ src=http://www.qatarliving.com/files/images/Da.gif>
Grr , I hate IE7 . It eats memory like there 's no tomorrow . IF IE8 has resolved this problem I might consider it . Even as I type , I find I can no longer ` right click ' and will restart it after I hit ` post ' ! <aÂ href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3615935822/Â title=TheÂ PearlÂ DevelopmentÂ PanoramaÂ byÂ baldrick2dogs,Â onÂ Flickr> < img src = `` http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3351/3615935822_2ca87f726f_m.jpg '' width = `` 240 '' height = `` 57 '' alt = `` The Pearl Development Panor
Second DR - use Safari or Firefox . ----- A wise young crackpot knows no fear - Ian Dury .
they say when you install IE8 , you wont be having problems with key ports especially if you use Windows Live Messenger . Better yet , switch to Firefox . good luck
-LRB- Dumb question -RRB- How do I switch to Firefox ? Mandi
Mandilulur ... time to delete the big `` E '' from your desktop ! Download and install Firefox from here : http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/personal.html If you already have it go to Tools - Options - General - system Default and click `` Check Now '' ... to make Firefox default browser .
Hi , this is Feran with the Internet Explorer Outreach Team . As long as you meet system requirements you should have no issue upgrading to IE8 . IE8 is a more secure and reliable browser . You can read more at the IEBlog - http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/ and check out these reviews regarding its security features - http://www.pcworld.com/article/161587/is_ie8_actually_safer.html http://www.itworld.com/internet/67113/ie-8-its-security-worth-download Also at this time if you download IE8 from http://www.browserforthebetter.com?ocid=ie8_sm_a Microsoft will donate 8 meals to Feeding America . Thanks , Feran
Thanks , all , I downloaded and installed it and it seems to work although I had to follow the instructions to disable an `` add-on . '' Ca n't see much difference but I LOVE to shop on-line so the added security is a good thing . I really have to get up my courage to download Firefox or Safari as a back-up browser . Mandi
Best advice - stay in lane . do not cut across .
Do not enter the roandabout until there is no approaching traffic from the left . If you going straight stay in the middlelane , if your going right stay in the right and if left stay in left . .
The best would be to drive <b> in </b> round abouts and not <b> on </b> round abouts .
use common sense
This should give you the definitive answer : http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/Highwaycode/DG_070338 Just remember that we drive on the opposite side to UK though , and unless you are turning left <b> do n't </b> indicate left !!! 184 On approaching a roundabout take notice and act on all the information available to you , including traffic signs , traffic lights and lane markings which direct you into the correct lane . You should use Mirrors Signal Manoeuvre at all stages decide as early as possible which exit you need to take give an appropriate signal -LRB- see Rule 186 -RRB- . Time your signals so as not to confuse other road users get into the correct lane adjust your speed and position to fit in with traffic conditions be aware of the speed and position of all the road users around you 185 When reaching the roundabout you should give priority to traffic approaching from your right , unless directed otherwise by signs , road markings or traffic lights check whether road markings allow you to enter the roundabout without giving way . If so , proceed , but still look to the right before joining watch out for all other road users already on the roundabout ; be aware they may not be signalling correctly or at all look forward before moving off to make sure traffic in front has moved off 186 Signals and position . When taking the first exit to the left , unless signs or markings indicate otherwise signal left and approach in the left-hand lane keep to the left on the roundabout and continue signalling left to leave When taking an exit to the right or going full circle , unless signs or markings indicate otherwise signal right and approach in the right-hand lane keep to the right on the roundabout until you need to change lanes to exit the roundabout signal left after you have passed the exit before the one you want When taking any intermediate exit , unless signs or markings indicate otherwise select the appropriate lane on approach to the roundabout you should not normally need to signal on approach stay in this lane until you need to alter course to exit the roundabout signal left after you have passed the exit before the one you want When there are more than three lanes at the entrance to a roundabout , use the most appropriate lane on approach and through it . 187 In all cases watch out for and give plenty of room to pedestrians who may be crossing the approach and exit roads traffic crossing in front of you on the roundabout , especially vehicles intending to leave by the next exit traffic which may be straddling lanes or positioned incorrectly motorcyclists cyclists and horse riders who may stay in the left-hand lane and signal right if they intend to continue round the roundabout . Allow them to do so long vehicles -LRB- including those towing trailers -RRB- . These might have to take a different course or straddle lanes either approaching or on the roundabout because of their length . Watch out for their signals 188 Mini-roundabouts . Approach these in the same way as normal roundabouts . All vehicles MUST pass round the central markings except large vehicles which are physically incapable of doing so . Remember , there is less space to manoeuvre and less time to signal . Avoid making U-turns at mini-roundabouts . Beware of others doing this . -LSB- Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 & TSRGD regs 10 -LRB- 1 -RRB- & 16 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RSB- 189 At double mini-roundabouts treat each roundabout separately and give way to traffic from the right . 190 Multiple roundabouts . At some complex junctions , there may be a series of mini-roundabouts at each intersection . Treat each mini-roundabout separately and follow the normal rules .
Get out early Morning and do a few practise rounds following the above lane disciplines To add a few more tips Once you build on your confidence - never keep up with the car next to you on either sides - pay extra attention to Land Cruisers/Karwas and domestic help drivers - dont react to flashing lights and constant honking , when they pass you by , show them your palm with a smile and then touch your palm to you heart , like saying pls forgive , trust me their whole face changes
DRIVE IN YOUR WON WISH , CONCENTRATE ON ALL 4 SIDE CARS AROUND YOU , THAT IS THE BEST WAY , MOSTLY ARABIC DOES IT .
with extreme caution
I enrolled in Al Khebra and this is what they taught me : Left Turning : Stay on LEFT LANE . 100 meters before round about signal left and slow down . Check your left for other vehicles that are already turning in the round about . If there are vehicles passing you just stop . If none then go to the inner lane of round about . Make sure your signal is left . As you pass the center of straight exit , signal right . Check your right mirror for cars then you can now go to left exit on the left lane or middle lane . U Turning : Stay on LEFT LANE . 100 meters before round about signal left and slow down . Check your left for other vehicles that are already turning in the round about . If there are vehicles passing you just stop . If none then go to the inner lane of round about . Make sure your signal is left . As you pass the center of left exit , signal right . Check your right mirror for cars then you can now go to u turn exit on the left lane or middle lane . Straight : Stay on MIDDLE LANE -LRB- if 3 lanes -RRB- or RIGHT LANE -LRB- if 2 lanes -RRB- . As you approach the round about slow down and check the left for other vehicles that are already turning in the round about . If free then go and stay on the middle or right lane of round about . As you pass the center of right exit , signal right . Check your right mirror for safety while you go in the straight exit . Stay on the middle lane or right lane as you go in . Right Turning : Stay on RIGHT LANE . Signal your right and as you approach the round about slow down to check for cars on your left that are already in the round about . If free then go and turn right . REMEMBER : 1 . The cars coming from the left side of the round about is the priority meaning you have to stop and give them way . 2 . Always use your signals so that other cars will know where you will be exiting . 3 . Not all drivers know the proper use of signals , lanes and priorities in the round about so BE CAREFUL . Drive defensively . I do n't have a picture to show you but I hope you understand those instructions above . Just picture the round about as a + | Straight Exit | | Left Exit ----------- Right Exit | | | Where you are coming from Hope this helps .
johnpur , where are your ponytails ?? And I think is not either race or religion ... it is money .
A country would have a pact with the devil for their own interest and benefit . It would n't matter if the devil was African , Asian or simply a Zionist . Salam
MD - Call for you and your bold letters . ______________________________________________ - Listen to Many ... Speak to a Few -
They 're not considered really white .
well donosa , time to upgrade myself
@ hapy , i second what Qatariladysaid , they 're considered middle-eastern -LRB- brown -RRB- , not white mate ... The support they enjoy is because the Jews control wall street & have a significant presence in the EU financial market as well & money talks
Have you ever actually met a Jew ??? Most of them are n't white , they looked Arab .
If not in real life , we see them on TV . In fact I have a Jewish friend whom I appreciate along with his family . Salam
It can not be just money , money might be a major factor when it comes for foreign policies of governments but we also see that European and American people esp whites are sympathetic to Israeli cause . According to this wikipedia article nearly 80 % jews of Israel come from european regions.http : / / en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Israel
I have seen them on tv and they look white like lippi tivini and netenyaho
SOME are white , and then not really European white . They have a unique look . If we are sympathetic to them it 's because we are dealing with about a 1000 years worth of guilt for how they were treated .
A Jew is not black or white . . He may be a kike , a yid , a heebie , a hook-nose , kosher or a Red Sea pedestrian , but not white ...
Gypsy , thats a very smart way of dealing with the guilt . And what do you mean that they look like arabs ? If you mean looking like light skinned arabs of syrian , palestinian type , or brown skinned like natives of Saudi Arabia , Yemen , Emirates etc. .
Late , but not too late : BOYCOTT RELIGIOUS THREADS !!
I 'm not boycotting threads , I 'm selective , you can do the same . Salam
This was NOT supposed to be religious . . It was about colour . . :O -RRB-
hows this a religious thread ?
Color means religion on QL , Race means religion on QL , Your favorite movie means religion on QL , What 's for lunch means religion on QL and Religion leads to something absolutely irreligious on QL . Salam
You 're right . . What I find strange is that with a whole wide world out there , so many non religious people can focus on religion so much :-RRB-
If someone mentioned on the lunch thread they 're going to eat bacon with eggs tonight , Hell will descend on earth , I know what you mean . Salam
Beef bacon is the most disgusting thing ever created .
We will know if it 's beef or pork bacon , when the QLer tells us what kind of wine they 're having with the meal ... :-RRB- -RRB- I do n't know , but generally Muslims do n't like to use the word bacon or mortadella . Although hotels serving Muslim meals use these terms . Salam
Thread Hijack Alert !!!!!!!!!!!!!! getting back to the topic . . I am sure that the Red Sea pedestrians would enjoy the same support , because of their `` influence '' in politics , industry and media .
If it 's about race the whole world will be impartial because we 're cousins . It has more to do with fear maybe not mutual interest . Remember JFK , Clinton and what 's - her-name ?
It is mutual . . i do n't want to piss them off because they can hurt me in many ways . . so both our interests are served : -RRB-
It 's mutual if no party feels under pressure to accept things they would normaly reject .

You 're pleasing your wife and so does your mother in law ... :-RRB- -RRB- Your wife is the Super Power here . This is a win-win visit for your own interest too . . :-RRB- We 're off topic again ! Salam
Naturally the whole world who are christianity by faith will give support to Israel for the very reasons of their origin of faith . Its not only the super powers like the US and EU who are seen on the front line of support but the little little voice scattered through out Asia and the North Americas . Literally , if the muslims pray towards the Makkah , the christian would pray towards Jerusalem .
The question is all wrong ... It has little to do with black or white , it has to do with religious people declaring land holy and thus protecting from distance their holy sites .

You can get tea tree oil at the Body Shop -LRB- or you could -RRB- and I 've seen Eucalyptus oil at FFC in the `` medicine '' section . Have you tried Occitane ?

Is it illegal anywhere in the world to drive a car not in your name ? Unless its been reported stolen , I have never heard of it being illegal to drive a car that is n't registered to you , anywhere in the world ...
just keep car 's istmara -LRB- registration -RRB- papers with you . . otherwise there is no problem at all
Anyone know any travel agency who provides tickets back and forth for re-entry ?
just want to know if it is okay not to finish family visit visa until July 22 . My husband needs to go back to Phil . for some reasons . Will it matter if we are planning to apply another visa by Jan. 2012 ?
Yep , you can come back on the same Visit Visa , if you are on Family visit visa ... Just get a form typed by the typist , go to booth no 4 at Main immigration , Pay 200 QAR and you will get a re entry visa ...
u can , obtain the reentry visa from Immigration , then u can re enter again to Doha .
Based on your nationality , you can get visa on arrival at UAE . Else keep following visas ready : 1 . Visit visa to UAE 2 . Visa for KSA 3 . Visa for Qatar If you are not in the list of 32 approved countries , you will be denied visa at the immigration points at UAE and Qatar .
The Visit Visa is only one entry , so you can not use same Visa if you go for exit in Qatar . You must obtain another visa when you try to re-enter in Qatar .
second hms 's reply , just make sure u get a re entry permit before u travel
what `` visit '' visa are you on ? Is it a Tourist visit visa through the hotel ? Is the a visit visa upon arrival ? Is it a Business visit visa ? Is it a Family visit visa ? ALL visas in Qatar are VISIT type , including Work visa . We are all VISITORS here , meaning NO citizenship shall be granted . But types of visit visa can be different . So let us start from it .
do they have visa like `` Get in touch visa ''

Hi Guys , Pls come to my assitance before i commit my self .
Its best to wait for their final offer letter . Salary and allwaonces are stated there . Only then you can make decission . Theres ample time even if you are to resign from your current position .
hmm i think you 'd get about 28k base .
Thanks everybody . If anyone working in QatarGas please PM me the salary grades .
I do n't work for QG but I 'm pretty sure grade 5 will be a bit under 20,000 base .
dude fubar ... 20k is optimum for Grade 7 , Grade 8 gets 17k ...
As I said , I do n't work there . You sound confident so I guess you know more than I.

hi Buddy either you seek the hlep of some airlines to get visa like qatar airways , or else take visa thru relaible agnts like , , Hotel Gulf Horizon , i think these two options are quite fwasible , for business visa it will cost you around Qr1800 for two month stay and 500 + for one month extension -LRB- optional -RRB- touris visa will be less but that wil b for a month only , thanks raj

Thanx a lot to all of you to guide me !!!!!
Can anybody guide me for the route of this area in najma from toyota signal
at najma . even u can try here on q.l search as furniture for sale .
You can buy as much as you like here ... Only need to wait for your RP and the Liquor Permit from QDC . Even if you do n't have those , you can always find people who can help you in procuring :-RRB- You just need to wait for the ramadan to get over though ... :-RRB- Source : - A study Conducted by FriedUnicorn - Vol I -LRB- September ,1999 -RRB-
You can purchase booze at the QDC and at designated bars . All of these close during Ramadan and will not re-open until probably Sept 19 or 20 . The current line here is if you want to enter most bars you have to provide your Qatar ID -LRB- or passport which has a copy of your RP in it -RRB- - this allows the police to `` track '' who is entering these establishments . Signature line > `` You ca n't fix stupid ''
LOL . i give you a clue if you can PM me > . <
Just do n't do that . You will never go beyond the customs check . Can buy it here when all papers are ready .
Do n't break the law . Just get your stuff from QDC . Why risk your future ? __________________________ <aÂ href=http://blog.iloveqatar.net> <imgÂ src=http://iloveqatar.net/images/mrqql.pngÂ border=0> Mr. Q 's Blog - A Qatari 's view on Qatar . </a>

geez man , talk about scaring people off !! ... no greenman you WILL NOT get deported for attempting to carry alcohol into the country as long as you do n't attempt to hide it , if you do carry , it will be noticed when they screen your bags , plead ignorance stating that because alcohol is legally available in the country , you thought it 'd be ok to bring in , the customs officer will sternly tell you that 's not the case , confiscate the bottle/s & you will be sent on your merry way ... IN NOT OUT ... this has happened to a good number of people i know & NOT ONE of them was put on the next flight back or deported or anything of the sort ... however i would advise caution if it 's during ramadan that you 're coming in ...
Work like you dont need the money Dance like no one is watching Love like you have never been hurt before Thanks for the advise will wait til I can buy legally.Did not realise you could buy in Qatar !!
Work like you dont need the money Dance like no one is watching Love like you have never been hurt before
actually to day i got same miss call from same type of number . but it 's a different number like +22355686969 . but i know it 's from my country bangladesh . because that time i call my country than i understand . some time all number not coming ... and some time all number coming but before come +22 like ... so it 's not to worry ...
The only thing i can tell you is that someone from Guinea is miss-calling you ... As far as I know there are multiple case where someone miss-calls and you call back and then your phone load is gone or you get charged a lot if you have a subscription . But as far as i know , now there are security measures in place to prevent this from happening . But that does n't mean that they do not happen anyway :-RRB- Just be careful and do n't call back . Send an email to Qtel or Vodafone and tell them about your problem . Normally they should be able to help -LRB- block the phone number from calling again -RRB- . I 'm not sure but i think you can also do that from your phone ...
I also found this : http://www.pluggd.in/getting-calls-224-missed-call-spam-297/ +223 it appears to be US/Canada ...
I also found this : http://www.pluggd.in/getting-calls-224-missed-call-spam-297/ +223 it appears to be US/Canada ...
it is a scam ... I have had calls from +224 , + 239 , +370 ... best advice is that if you dont recognise the number , do n't answer the call and do n't call back or text ...
Are you crazy to call back an unknown number ? Do you know someone to call from that country code ? Have you heard about sim cloning ? If they want to talk to you they will call again . It could be a trap . There are lots of mafia who are doing cloning of sim cards and using it for illegal purposes . If you call back your sim could get cloned and will be used by them for illegal activities which could lead you to great trouble . If you are getting missed calls from unknow numbers just ignore it for being safe .
That 's a PHONE CALL SCAM from American state of Illinois or from the country of Guinea . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_codes_847_and_224 http://countrycode.org/guinea
I heard that when you call to those mobile numbers all your data saved in the phone can access to the other party ... its another scam method . . So dont call back them ... `` If you are important for somebody the call will come gain ... Dont go behind ugly dog who does n't care about you ''
hi approach the legal authorities and present this case to them . show your bank account details to prove that you dont have job and is not paid for 1 or two months etc. be submissive to your boss and its your need to get this offer . convince her on your situation and inability to continue here even if the job is on as your boss say . I do belive that once she is convince that you have no other way and will leave her , she will agree for it . Her main issue may be that if you leave with NOC others will also come in line for that . manoj
Take her out for a drink and speak your soul out to her , I am sure she is going to say a yes and remain your friend forever and never a boss
Mr. Manoj , there ca n't b harm if i approach for legal action ... i mean they can cancel me . plz tell me how to n to whom i have to approach
DO what Meet12345 said . . thats a best solution . . else you have to file a case , that salary is not according to your qualification and experience . . and get the release by court . . our accountant did same thing with his previous company . -LRB- 2nd option -RRB- but try your best to get release from her in proper way . . convince her . count a million problems . or else demand a big salary . and in mean while try for another country . . may be you get good chance out side qatar . . life is not only in Qatar . .
Dear . Try to be more active and strong with her as she have no reasons to keep u doing the same every month for nothing just show that you r angry and may contact the labor department . for more info u can call me any time 77513154 . most of sponsors need no issues with labor ministry so you can count on it as she ca n't pay u
since you are telling your present company is not having job , so convince him to release you and provide NOC
Its a common problem , try to handle and manage your boss . otherwise no way to get NOC .
It purely depends upon your relationship . Buy some sweets and try to meet her after office hours if possible . As you both chickas so i guess meeting outside is not so tough . And show her you offer and discuss your future plan with her like you will get married , you have problems in your family , you need to be more financially secured to help them etc. . I did the same to leave my previous employer . My Boss was so impressed that he gave me NOC and he gave me his own money too . Of course I dont wanted money from his pocket but my story was so emotional . I guess you got the point .

Hi You can search online for a program called `` Baby Einstein '' which in short is a way to teach your child to be smarter ... Very interesting
I agree with Rasheed , ... . . BABY EINSTEIN is the best CD/DVD for baby learning . Also try SEMAME STREET CD . I read stories that 1 child -LRB- 3 years old -RRB- can read and talk becouse of the parent every morning turn-on SESAME STREET program , and its start from year 1 .
hai 2 years is too early to start formal learning . . at the same time no need to neglect learning session completely ... you can use building blocks to make her familiar with the concept of numbers ... spend quality time with the kid and thus she learns names of objects with out being burdened ... read lots of stories so that she becomes familar with books and her imagination works and books automatically become her friends when she grow up ... Formal learning can wait till she is 3 ... Enjoy your time with her because kids grow up fast ...
kids are learning all the time , talk to your child all the time . talking and reading fun books with your child will give them a good start . baby einstein videos are great you can watch some of the dvds on youtube link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQY71epI14Q&feature=related You can also view lots of learnig materials on ABC 's , learning colours , nursery rythmes etc on youtube . link : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtFXYvNIxws Bear in mind while these videos are good for kids to watch and learn , dont replace them with reading , drawing with crayons , puzzles , blocks etc. . also be invloved and play with your child , they will learn whilst they are having fun with you .

i salut the wall for giving the tenants a very woderful services . i go fo the wall , its highly recommended !
`` the wall '' is one the best ! i had a lot of experiences living from one flat to another and im proud to say that i made the rigth decision . from the staff down to the maintenance they were all accomodating and provide excellent custome service .
If you 're looking for a flat , dont think twice because the wall provides everything you need ! i 've been with them for 3 years and now i just renewed my contract with them , the staff were decent and if you have any questions or encounter any problems with their service they will never hesitate to extend a helping hand .
i recommend the wall real estate !!
aside from a good rate of services level , one thing more wonderful about the wall real estate is that the people behind , the staff are very nice and friendly , they are treating us as good friends , more like a family actually . i belive it is a factor that determines the rises and the fall of a certain company . go for the wall , surely you will not regret .
the wall real estate stands out among any other real estate company in doha and proud to say that they have a good reason to be . my family has been living in one of their apartments and we are really satisfied with the quality of their service . just last month , we renewed our contract with them . truly , your investment with the wall will never gone to waste . goodluck !
good thing about the wall is that either major or minor problems we encountered at their apartment , they will be there quickly to fix it.once the lock of or bedroom door got broken and i figured out how to fix it because its just a minor problem and my kid is the one responsible for that , so i did what i can do and still i cant find the way -LRB- not to mention that i am not really in to it -RRB- , so i decided to give a call in their office and told them what happened , after 30 minutes , the maintenance is there to fix the lock.big thanks !!
im just new in their apartment and it was never a bad experience at all .
At first i was hesistant with ` the wall ' until i got the chance to speak with one of their staff . i was greateful that she provided me answers to all my questions . the wall does not only offer you good and nice flats/villa/units but at the same time they also have respectful and sincere staff .
ILL GIVE THE WALL A RATING OF 1 . SUPERB !!! GOOD JOB TO THE MANAGEMENT!I LOVE MY UNIT !
excellent!excellent!excellent ! try out the wall .
good people . . good units only at the wall real estate.see for yourself , ive tried it .
indeed , excellent !!
one of my friend has changed flats being incomfortable with 3 real estates ... now he rented with Wall realestate & is happy since last 2 years with their outstanding service .
it really feels good if we voice out what we feel deep inside , it soothes all the negative energies around.just same like this forum , some say good things or the other way around regarding a certain issue . anyway , my encounter with the wall real estate is a very heart warming and worth remembering incident . it was when i was suffering from fever and the fridge in my apartment stop working , so i called the staff asking if they can fix it for me , after 2 hours they came and just after they got it back to the normal , i suffered from convulsion , what the staff did was they called the ambulance and brought me to the hospital -LRB- i am living alone , so no one can do that for me -RRB- . until now i am still with the wall.such a very wonderful staff .
im glad i met the wall !!!
i was apprehensive to try the wall real estate but through the testimonies of my co workers who was with the wall , i was encourage and never did i thought that it was a fantastic decision i have made . there was this one time that i had to call them because the exhaust fan of my kitchen does not work properly , guess what , before the day ends , they fixed it .
the flats are spacious , clean and very homey . for sure you will like it .
few years ago i bump in to the wall real estate , i was eager to know their facilities and over all maintenance of their apartments.And when i saw that all is done properly and neatly , i moved to their flat and until now , i am still with them . i am really satisified with their service .
yes!really amazing real estate!if i were you , check first the flats and decide.for sure you will like it , just like us , just first glimpse of the apartment then we fell in love with the unit and plus the staff who was with us was really nice .
the quality of their services is outstanding and the staff are friendly . surely , you will not regret it . i have been residing in one of their flats and it is really nice .
I have just been through all the responses for this question . Its seems that 90 % of the positive feedback - and it is REALLY positive feedback has come from people who have been members of QL for no less than 1 day ! Is it possible that someone from the wall has seen this question and created loads of profiles and then given loads of excellent feedback ? No real estate agency in Qatar is that excellent !!
well , i guess who can really testify of their services are those who has been living with the wall and i am one of them . i am greateful that finally i have found a place where i can call home . you should give them a try .
i also go through all the answers and its possible that someone from the wall made all these bunch of comments , but we really dont know.maybe yes and maybe no . i am also new in QL and i guess every hour someone sign up on this site , it means that QL is growing fast . well , about the question , i can say that they are a good real estate company.my filipino friend lives in one of their flats and based on what she experienced with them , she was satisfied.i was also given the chance to meet their office staff and they are so amazing . maybe , some find it unbelievable but for those who has good experience with them , the wall is one of the best real estate here in doha . see and believe , dont just believe what you hear . have a great day !!
i go for the wall !
They suck and I would not rent anything from them again . We are waiting for our contract to finish so that we can see the back of them.No service , no up keep of properties , rude staff and they make you pay for everything even if it was wear and tear . Good luck .
They are so bad . I have been trying to move out for 2 years . The service is so bad and watch out for your deposit when you leave ! It will take so long to pay and if they do , they will keep part of it . Why ! Excuses and more excuses . Every time I spoke to the staff , it felt like hitting your head against The Wall ! Ironic !! : - -LRB-

the best and it really works !! is at carrefour is called SPRING ' anty bladluis ' is a green can . is for gardening but was the only one to kill my bed bugs and is cheap ! and safe for beds . =-RRB- please try it . is in the gardening section
The best thing to kill bed bugs is actually FREE - UV light ! take your mattress outside for a few hours . do n't forget to turn it regularly .
They are the worst creatures/bugs on planet earth . Its so difficult to exterminate them . What ever pesticide you will use most probably they will show up again . What ever the pesticide . The only thing I believe can work is that take all your wooden furniture out in hot sunny day including your bed and leave it there for couple of hours . Killing them by burning them is the only good solution . Pesticide can work but you will never get 100 % results . I once saw a documentary on national geographic and I am telling you its really hard to get rid of them . If you think they are coming from the next room then my recommendation to move out . If I have to pay 10K for one room I will instead living in a room which is free but full of bugs . Good Luck exterminating bugs . Peace .
You can try Carrefour saw some thing there . But like Balderick2dogs suggested UV light is best will get rid of most of these bugs . .
Hi friends , Those nasty bed bugs are not only living on the bed . They live on the curtains , furnitures and even under carpet . If you leave them untouched for some time they will increase in number . UV light is good for killing them from your bed but you can not take everything to sun light . It will be better if you treat all the materials in your room at the same time . Take your bed to the balcony or terrace and leave it there for two three days in the hot sun light turning it upside down very often . You may use the pesticide -LRB- the one from Carrefour -RRB- in your room for one or two days . Spray well and keep the room closed . You should use it vigorously . This will kill the bed bugs in your room as well as on your bed . Make sure that your friends in the other room should also do it at the same time otherwise you will not be able to clear them .
UV light !
Buy `` Good bye bed bugs '' spry from Al-meera . This is a product of `` Good bye '' company . I do n't know this available in Qatar , but Available in UAE .

<P> Hello , </P> <P> I am owning BMW 730Li . </P> <P> It 's a great car , vry smooth drive . But yes BMW costs triple than other brands like Toyota , Honda etc. </P> <P> For example , </P> <P> Oil Tank Filling : QAR 30-35 -LRB- Toyota etc -RRB- & QAR 85-90 -LRB- BMW -RRB- </P> <P> I am giving you example of filling tank because its a major thing which we have to do after 2 or 3 days . You can imagine its maintainance cost . Its 100-150 % expensive BUT its ride give you pleasure . Really amazing . </P> <P> GOOd Luck ! </P>
<p> </p> <p> Oil tank filling in every 3 days ? ... means weekly twice ? </p> <p> I cant understand </p> <p> can someone explain me ? did i read correctly ? </p>
<p> The cars are amazing . As long as you have BMW Service Inclusive , nearly everything is covered . If you dont have service included , maintanence is going to be Very expensive . Eg : QR 1800 for changing the cars battery , where it would be around QR 500 for a Toyota . </p> <p> </p> <p> Good luck ! </p>
Thank you all for the valuable information you have provided me .
If you are pregnant , they wii not refer you for X ray checking
Is n't the x-ray required to obtain the health card and approval of the family visa , though ?
x-ray is omitted for pregnant ladies . They might also ask you to come once more for an injection -LRB- not sure what it is . . heard it from friends -RRB- .
Correct , no X-Ray for pregnant women .
They have n't understood the question . Instead of asking `` Country '' it should say `` Which country are you from ? ''
The signing up for QL is a bit confusing . . It is nit only the members fault but also to do with the questions asked when signing up . . But can be changed to the country . .
up to them , , i think thers no problem bout that ...
For What you proud to be your Nationality . . ?? Can u asnwer me in detail Mr. ??
Well maybe they are comfortable with that . But Whether they call themselves as QATARE , JAPANESE , TIMBUKTIANS OR MARTIAL is for all i care as long as they behave themselves like human being ...
well , it depends if you can show some attitude and communication skills to the Immigration officer in Dubai and be able to convince him that you are just enterting dubai for specific purpose then you might get a visa on arrival .

yes you can , but you need visa for go to dubai

just drove to Dubai last thursday it took me about 7.5 hours . that is stops at the borders , stopping for gas and food and an average speed or about 130 kph . Also you would need to be traveling with your husband as a women traveling alone is not allowed through Saudi . 1 . Letter of no objection is required from your work then you submit your passports through the agency which will cost about 125 QAR . keep in mind also you will need to submit the registration card copy of which car you will be taking .
You need a letter from your work place proving your salary is more than 3300 . and if still not accepted then transfer your salary to Commercial bank or QNB but before that go and check with them will they issue you any credit cards or no . still if not check with their Islamic banking . am sure you will get from them
Apply with standard charted bank
so i will call islamic bank now , and tell them that i need credit card and thats it ? if no tell me what to do , if yes pliz gim me the islamic bank num ??? please , i know im exagerating , but i really appreciate , waiting , thanks

If your looking plastic chairs and tables I could arrange it for you . . No idea about cateres
Hi azzy girl , most of the restaurants do outdoor catering , like the sterling restaurants , and many others Indian joints , even shater abbas . It 's a buffet charged per plate . Most restaurants serve mixed cuisine , so it should n't be a problem . Are you looking for something specific ?
Thanks han19 , seasons ... Its just a smalll gathering as its my 42nd birthday , my fiance is arriving Sunday so we could sit down and plan for the wedding in May 2012 . Never given a party at my place so I need some chairs and tables . Cooking is not really my strong point so I need a caterer . . order 4-5 dishes for 20 people . Havent even sent out the invites yet ... not sure even if anyone would show up ... as I 'm not really a good person ... they say :-RRB-
Just let me know the date , time and location and I can have it sent over to you . .
hi azzy ... its a small group , and 4-5 dishes might turn out expensive . if you let me know the kind of cuisine you prefer , i may be able to help you plan ordering it . its better to order it by dishes rather than order it by catering . You can then order whatever you like . just think about it .
No charge as long as its not broken : -RRB-

tcom your spot on , a troll on the loose with a QL ID of bepsy ... now where are my bobcorn . . : -RRB-
is that you exile ?
Thank you all . You have give me more than enough information with your questions . This is going to be a difficult decision , since I do n't consider converting to Islam as an easy option . Pretending to be something you are not and live like that every day is not something one should accept easily . P.S. I do n't understands why some of your think i am a trolling ? : -RRB-
Bepsy is a word used only in QL how come a new user knows this word ... You are a TROLL
How is bepsy used in QL ? This is my standard nickname in many forums . I do n't understand why username bepsy makes me a troll , but never mind ...
If I may ask , Does your civil marriage certificate mention the religious background of your wife ? if not , I say attest it at the nearest Qatari embassy and you are safe to go , if your wife has a typical Muslim name so does Obama `` Hussain '' .
hello bepsy . . better to refuce the offer witch u got ... ... ther is fight started before u come ... i cant imagine what will be happen after u come ... ... . . we dont want make trouble for ql members ... ... ...
Tak jsi z chorvatska ?
OK , bepsy !
Thank you Dracula , glad you liked my photos . Thank you .
saeed khan alwayssssss greate ... ... . he has answer whatever the question ... ... ... we must respect him ... i realy love u saeed khan ...
What about living together ? You do n't have any issues with that ? Since it is considered illegal .
its not considered illegal as long as u have a marriage certificate attested from the embassy of the respective countries . They didnt even ask us abt our religion !
I never heard any religion saying that if you LOVE someone , and because of you are JUST DIVIDED BY FAITH , loving him/her will give you one way ticket to HELL . Religion usually refers and teaches fairness , respect , truth , humility . So NO DISCRIMINATION of faith in marrying as per as I know . I have several friends married Muslim to a Non-Muslim , either way but the teachings of goodness manifest on how they apply towards other people and work , and not towards on what they are believing religion . Anyway , OPINION is a really opinion ... There is no right nor wrong . And we can not further discuss if the basis is Holy Quoran and Holy Bible . We can not justify arguments from different basis . They have both their own strong points , deal with it . If the marriage documents are attested by the both consul , then I think there is no problem and big deal at all . This is just a discussion forum , do n't use this as your actual reference . The best thing is to inquire your cases to Qatar Government Agency directly , you are not the only one who have this kind of problem anyway , I 'm very sure there is always fair ruling that you can get from them . Good luck !
`` Anyway , OPINION is a really opinion ... There is no right nor wrong . '' But the marriage in Islam is NOT a matter for anyone to give an opinion over ... It 's a fixed law . It 's forbidden ... So it 's WRONG . . any `` true '' muslim would n't even dare to cross that line ... but I assure you whoever did it . . they 're muslims by name . . and I do n't think they care to pray or fast ... If they fear God . . they would n't have done it ...
very well said !
muslim
Okay , so I guess getting a working visa for us would not be a problem since there are two different sponsors . But the fact that we would be doing something illegal concerns me . We would most definitely be living together and that should be considered illegal because of our muslim-christian marriage . And on top of that , we could not get a housing from sponsor because our marriage is considered faulty .
sorry , misunderstood Op post
I know of a family whose family visa was rejected on the grounds that the marriage certificate -LRB- attested by the embassy -RRB- was not valid/legal . The wife was Muslim and the husband Christian . Since you have been offered jobs by different sponsors visa might not be the problem . But I assume you will be living together so please look into the fact that your marriage will be considered legal/not .
There be no problem in getting visa because you 'll be working w / different sponsors . You will only face problems when caught living together and/or if you change your wife 's sponsorship under you . Because Islamically you are not legally married and Qatar is an Islamic country .
But would the employer -LRB- if housing is provided -RRB- know that he is not Muslim -LRB- whether housing is provided by either employer -RRB- ?
Mega troll alert . Bepsy gave you away ...
I do n't think your marriage will be considered valid here . There was a story some time back about a couple who were deported after some public display of affection issues on the Cornish . When the case went to court turned out that their marriage was considered invalid and they both ended up being deported .
Troll
My hubby is a convert and he had to have legal documents attesting his conversion , along with our marriage certificate , as he has n't changed his name legally . Thus he has to prove he is a Muslim when applying for family status . So the sponsor will find out the OP 's not a Muslim unless he has documents to prove he is a convert .
from different sponsors ... so no problem ...
bepsi thats amazing . Good luck troll
Never think about it , maintinance cost is very high and the resell value is very low .
Ask previous Volvo owners . If you ask the vast majority of Qatar Living members that will drive nothing but Japanese cars then you wo n't get an honest answer . Also please do remember that you are buying a prestige brand so the cost of maintaining that will be more than a cheap , volume brand . When it comes to customer service at Volvo service centres , please just try them once . They are professional , courteous and most of all honest . If you would like any information or history on the car you are buying please do not hesitate to contact me on 6022476 . I work for DOMASCO Volvo and we DO VALUE ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS !
I 've been using Volvos for about 5 years now both in Qatar and in the UK and they have proven to be very reliable cars . The cost of maintenance is slightly higher than most but then you are getting what you pay for . Regarding the comment about cars falling apart after 5 years , I think that person was talking about American cars .
I agree with Joe90 . The S80 a great car . Here in North America both Volvo and Honda are considered great cars -LRB- and Toyota -RRB- that offer great value and great service from dealers . It 's disappointing to hear the dealers of these cars n Qatar does n't hold up their end of the bargain . You 'd hardly need to worry about a Volvo breaking down . When it does , yes , parts are a bit more expensive than Japanese cars but nowhere near the level of Mercedes or BMW . It 's comfortable and safe , huge trunk , sporty feel . You could feel the heavy weight of the car when you first start driving it , which is why it uses as much gas as it does . I love mine but sadly have to sell it soon when I move to Doha . So , that 's why relatively , I see less Hondas on sale on this site than Toyotas . The dealership . I was wondering why I do n't see the Honda Ridgeline and Pilot listed anywhere , nor the Toyota Sienna . Honda 's mystery solved .
Oh blocked noses are very common in children this age !! There is a medical reason for this but I 'm not sure enough what it is to post ... . . Do n't put your child through the stress of bloods and xrays for nothing ... its extremely traumatic for them !
Thanks Ranishkt and Seema , Thatz so assuring.She is `` somewhat '' okay after she left the Day care . DoraTheExplorer . . A big thanks to you.I was really worried about her blocked nose thing.She was not getting proper sleep too for the last 3 months when I left her at the day care.And sometimes she used to bring back her water bottle full.Can u imagine she was not drinking water also.I saw that twice and then removed her from that day care immdly.Now she is with my maid.By god 's grace she is doing okay.Still keeping my fingers crossed.There were days when I used to check her forehead continuosly for any fever -LRB- I know itz crazy but I was just going mad -RRB- . I am now becoming bolder after a lot of assurance/inputs from all.Thanks to all .
einstind , you 're welcome ... hope she 's better now ... theres alot to be said for sleep in children this age , thats why it bothers me when I see young children up at ridiculous o'clock , they need sleep and rest to boost their immune system . When they do n't get enough they fall ill with all and sundry ! ...
You go for urine routine and culture test evn doctor say no . This will help you . My son had similar problem and doctor was keep on saying ear infection , Viral infection and so on . We did urine test and found UTI . Proper treatment was done according to the requirement .
I am not a heatlh care provider , but I recommend you change the doctor . If it is a viral infection , there will be no need for antibiotics . why is he/she giving her antibiotics ????????? and 3 antibiotics in 3 months ???? oh come on ! And why not a blood test ???? Go to another doctor . .
get another doctor 's opinion . . just to be sure , have your child undergo a general physical as well as complete blood workup even X-ray . . no harm in doing that , this is your child 's health at stake . . <aÂ target=_blankÂ href=http://www.blingcheese.com/> <imgÂ src=http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s235/revmyspace2/graphics/Misc/Smileys/smiley_25009t7y685v0e.gifÂ title=MySpaceÂ CommentsÂ border=0> </a> <br> < a target = '' _ blank '' href = `` http://www.blingchees
The link is very informative . .
Hi einstind There is no such a thing as Viral Fever , because 1 . If its viral there is no fever in the body . 2 . If there is fever it means there is infection somewhere and the natural body defense is trying to fight it by increasing the body temp . The fact she is in daycare that means exposed to many new things to her system teach her always to wash her hands . 3 years old are very smart and can remember rules :-RRB- This is what I personally do when my kid doesnt feel well : 1 . No medication -LRB- NO Antibiotic -RRB- 2 . Keep checking the temp . Every 1/2 hr . 2 . Take him to my chiropractor for spinal adjustment -LRB- Dr. Cyrus is our chiropractor here in Doha -RRB- that will help the child 's natural immunity system . 3 . Chicken soup with lots of onion and garlic . 4 . No sweets or fried food . 5 . Let her eat plain yogurt it helps to reduce the inner body temp . 6 . Light clothes and keep washing her feet with cold water . Hope this will help
Thanks a lot for the information.Could you please let me know what does a chirpractor do?I mean his role ... Anyway will google it also . .
Can I ask u who is ur kid 's doc ??!
My daughter 's doctor is Dr Attiya at Al Ahli , we have also seen Dr Samer there as well . He is very good too . They might be a little on the expensive side , but very worth it as far as your child 's health goes . Motherhood ... The hardest job you 'll ever love ! : -RRB-
Einstind , I had the same problem with my daugter when she was in the DayCare but since your child is at home try starting with shampooing your sofa set and carpets and keep your house dust free . Al rafa there is good doctor for children Dr.Basha or try Dr. Shaboon at Doha Clinic
We go to PEC or to Dr Badsha of AL-rafa . .
nqatar , Was ur daughter prescribed freq antibiotics ?
If it was me , i would take the kid home . Ca n't trust the medical profession here !!! period . ------------------------------------------ Quidquid latine dictum sit , altum sonatur .
Since we are here , my 3 years old daughter is always sick , she was never sick before , always having high fever , cough , her doctor used to say its an allergy he was just changing the medecins and giving her antibiotics , so i decided to take her to another doctor when t told him what happend he decided to do a chest x ray and he found out that my daughter had atypical pneumonia !!! So you have nothing to loose by doing a chest x ray ... by the way she got it from the nursery ... good luck .
Also if it is a virus , they are not supposed to give you anything for it . You are supposed to let it run it 's course . No antibiotics . I hate it when my daughter is sick ... I feel so helpless . I hope your little one feels better soon . Be strong . Motherhood ... The hardest job you 'll ever love ! : -RRB-
By God 's grace she is okay now.Hoping that she will not fall sick again.But this is what I am going to do the next time she falls sick.I am going to insist the doctor for an X-ray and a blood work-up . Bcoz she is having blocked nose very frequently -LRB- not running nose -RRB- . I suspect there is something beyond this normal cold and fever thing .
Get a humidifier or take her in the bathroom with you and run the shower on hot so it creates a lot of steam . That will help clear her nose . Another thing I use is Vicks Baby Vaporub . It has menthol and eucalyptus , and it opens their little noses pretty quick . I worry about the medical care standards here , but so far Dr 's Attiya and Samer at Al Ahli have done a great job for my daughter and we have been here almost 2 years . Good luck , hope the little one stays well ! : -RRB- Motherhood ... The hardest job you 'll ever love ! : -RRB-
Its better to do a chest x-ray ... ask the doctor to test for pneumonia ... the doctors here dont really diagnose it at the initial stage ... but it will be worse later . repeated fever is one of the symptoms ... <aÂ href=http://photobucket.com/images/funnyÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg12/N-A-T-A-S-J-A/Funny/smile.gifÂ border=0Â alt=smileÂ Pictures,Â ImagesÂ andÂ Photos/> </a>
The new name given by my family to this VI is School Syndrome , you shall notice that this occurs frequently when the schools open and continues . This SS goes away or stabilizes when the schools go for longer break -LRB- fortnight or more -RRB- . The issue is that we go to the doctors when the symptoms are acquired and he works with you to remove or stable it . The area where no body works on is the prevention , both the parents and the school managements or even the health authorities . It is all left on herd immunity but does not affect much . The parent should teach the kids basic hygienic plus give them fresh clothes every day and make them take shower every time they land in and also give them the natural preventive gifts -LRB- details can be provided on direct IM/PM -RRB- The school should have better distances between each pupil -LRB- seating arrangement -RRB- and better ventilation arrangement in the class and or playground -LRB- if internal -RRB- and further monitor that no kids with flue or infection should attend the classes . Furthermore the transport should be much cleaner and well ventilated . The schools should also have records of the pupil who have pets at home specially the caged/feathered pets , to be sure of the possible sources should some viral infections arise from the pets , . The Health authority should be the observers for both of the above actions on frequent basis . this can get really worrying if with this frequent hit of viral infection and following on use of Antibiotics , the children will get immune to the AB and then one have to use steroids which is not good at all . This out of my experience should bring the so called ` school syndrome ' to the least ... Hope this helps you as well . Take Care
My Kid was in a daycare for the past 2 and a half months.She felt sick very frequently when she was in daycare . But now she is at home with my maid.She was fine for last 15 days.But got fever again yesterday -LRB- doctor says `` VIRAL '' again -RRB- . I am just worried if it cud be something serious .
Abusaif , Will keep it in mind . FS , The doctor says no need of xray or blood test.He said there is no sign of pneumonia as well.I am just totally confused and to be frank frustrated . As a mom I am not able to see her taking medicine frequently and in 3 months she has been given 3 antibiotics.And one started again yesterday . .

Yes it is Westbay Area just after the roundabout of th exhibition centre on your right when going towards the zigzag towers ----------------- `` HE WHO DARES WINS '' Derek Edward Totter
And what purpose does it serve ?
It 's the only way . If you choose the cheapest postage on Amazon it gets ' better still . Aramex of course charge for the postage but there is an option on Amazon to send all your orders together . I do n't know if this works out cheaper or not . I just order at will and when it comes I pay the fee .
There are plenty of things to buy online that are a lot cheaper than buying in Qatar , here are some of the things that I have bought online : Apple products - much cheaper Sunglasses - Raybans ; much cheaper Mobile phone accessories Asics Gel trainers - much cheaper Books - Much better selection and cheaper . Generally anything that I want to buy that is going to cost over QR500 , I will check online to see how much I can get it for there . I get all the stuff sent to my aramex account and then sent to me here in Doha .
Never had any online purchase , but would like to get some feedback .
In Amazon if you choose products which are sold and shipped by Amazon you have the option of shipping them as one package , or if you get some products which is being sold by amazon but sold by some other seller then it will be shipped from two places to your Aramex account . Aramex unfortunately does not have the possibility to consolidate all your packages and ship as you want , hope they start it soon coz of their prices . But DHL Easyshop does it . I have n't used them till now , but if i do end up buying from different places then i would definitely use it .
check the prices online + tax + shipping rates then compare the items price sold in Qatar . i bought DLSRs , lenses and camera accessories for me and my friends in amazon.com or adorama.com as it is much cheaper there with shipping rate and tax included
About 10 days normally - but you should consider using Aramax 's SHIP and SHOP service next time
In Qatar , it is not delivered . One has to go to post office to collect even letters . When bank sent credit cards to me via mail , I got repeated calls from post office to collect my mail from post office . At first I was very much surprised to hear that , I got mail . It is in post office and I was asked to come during post office working hours to collect it ? Then why it is called postal service ? Wait for phone call from post office after Eid holidays .
hey guys thanks for your reply , its a bit funny that a postal service lets you pick up mails and they dont deliver ! anyway how do i collect the parcel ? -LRB- it was a mobile phone -RRB-
Yes there is , Not it is n't and yes you can .
Yes , yes , yes .
it 's happening anywhere not just here in Doha and Bahrain , it 's even rampant in Saudi !!!
lol ... run !
me like live-in but gf no like ... tsk ! :P ---------- Quality dude ! Quality !
whew !!!! you should be asking `` what trouble could it Be '' ? ... to share some stories : ' I have been to deportation last year to visit some run away housemaids ... while talking to the ladies , i 've noticed one Chinese in a special room , they said she was detained caused by HIV , , , from a Live-In partner . another lady came out carrying 7 days old baby , , newly born . . then i asked why she was there and what 's the case ? she said - LOVE CASE ... in the deportation : 90 % LOVE CASE , 5 % absconding , 1 % theft , the rest are other cases brought down by companies ... ` I 've been to Court house few months ago , , and I met 3 housemaids , all were wearing Abayas and asked what 's the cases they are up to ... all of them replied ... LOVE CASE . The second month i need to go back there and I met them again , they said they were all detained and just waiting for the court decision , on the final verdict of my case . . i went back there and I met only 1 lady , so sad to say , , she was carrying her 1 month old baby , , with the man beside her ... both of them got punished . . slashes for the man , detention and deportation and completely banned for Qatar employment . A neighbor 's house was raided by cops last 4 months and captured a Pinay and Syrian living together unmarried..-both were still in the detention up to now . . Another couple has just terminated and deported recently by their company because of the same case . . . . people with the same case and were repatriated immediately are still lucky -- they were not tortured . . adams.apple , these are just few of the many cases I 've witnessed , , people might not believe it as it may not be in the newspapers or any other means of media , but what I have highlighted above are based from what i have witnessed personally . . . . Got a clue , be an expert soon . .
so its a crime here ! i get the point . Bullong phew exhaustive info . .
if any accident your wife presence in needed
if my wife is not der with me i m the one who does the accident or violation so at the time of police check i can call my wife ok
can any one tell me exact answer
Why , did you make an accident already with your nissan sunny which you bought a few days ago ? If Im not mistaken you bought the car for Qr 26,000 ?
no i havent done accident just asking dear
No need of papers if you are doing it on your own . By the way if you give your bus to some company for their use & ask them to pay you monthly rent , it would save you all trouble :-RRB- Good luck .
And they wo n't allow that . it 's illegal .
i believe , consciouseffort has been sarcastic . . :-RRB- nadiaqatar , you are member on QL for 1 year 46 weeks . . do n't you still know that you have to ask a permission for your every step in qatar . . and you ask such silly questions : do you need papers to run your business ? that 's why you get such silly answers : no , yallah , no need nothing , no papers , no registrations , no 100 permits ... just buy your bus , or plane or helicopter and do whatever you want . .
You need a permit to have a billiards table in your cafe and to sell sheesh shah ... So for a bus ... . .
thanks for ur reply , but i am serious
Buy a van and rent to any company
how much the used van here i can find?any idea plz
I m serious . You just try to buy a new model van bus with AC . Any company can easily take it in monthly rent bases . Try local market to buy one or try QL . It 's legal .
Put a classifieds ad in QL & let someone contact you ... you 'll automatically know if paper work is required for just 1 bus/van or no
The issue with this is not that it can not be done , have you thought about what will happen if your bus thats rented out to some company meets with an accident ? The cops will catch you for renting it out without paper work .
qatarisun i will not drive the bus by myself of course all ok i understand i need a paper work , can u tell me exactly what kind of paper work do i need and from where i can issue ? thanks
You ca n't buy any commercial transpiration with out Qatari name or company name . When you buy one then they have to give you all required paper you need for your needs .
hi all , if you find a solution please pass it me also ... ,
thx the smart
You can get at least for QR .3300 sometimes including electricity and water , but it is a portion or part .
what is duhar ? where is it ? you mean Dukhan ?
sorry ... i meant doha .
it depends the location . you can get between qr 2500 to 6500 .
Yeah , c_dem is right usually if you are near the city or your in the city it cost much .
Anyone can find best apartment room in Bhubaneswar with other facilities . Propertymatrix.co.in
Bring an unlocked phone -LRB- that uses a normal sim card -RRB- with you . You can get a pre-paid -LRB- pay as you go -RRB- Hala -LRB- service name -RRB- sim from Qtel in the arrivals terminal after customs on production of your passport . Once you get your RP , you can keep the number and change to Shawry -LRB- service name , 30day rolling contract -RRB- . With regard to QTEL landline and internet , you can get a pre-paid dongle initially , then again once you have a RP you can get QTEL landline and broadband connected . Dont hold your breath regarding how quick they do it though , we 've been here for a couple of months , had my Rp for 6 weeks and still havent got broadband . You will have to get permission from your landlord , but this shouldnt be a problem . Hope this helps
One does not need Land lords permission to get land line + ADSL .
It depends on where you gon na stay . Many LL here provide internet TV telephone connections . GSM cards you can even get in airport . -LRB- :
Ur wlcm . Landline to landline calling is free . You have both pre paid and post paid services here . Check these two websites for more details http://www.qtel.qa/en/home http://www.vodafone.qa/en
As you land in doha withing 20 days you will get your RP then you can take phone connection and internet and cable connection from QTEL . . QTEL is the best
Many thanks sidhingra . With all the big things you need to do with moving you forget about these small ones so thank you
Re . Aspire , they run fitness classes but I 'm a bit more keen on actually playing some sport ! Getting so out of shape in Qatar . . Rein , I did consider a treadmill but they take up space and also I find the pressure on knees is not good for me ! Really just want something that will be fun and a good way to make friends as well !
Check with CNA-Q Sontana , I think they have an Ultimate Frisbee team , it 's for both men and women , but at least it 's a team ... Oh and they do offer a women 's Rugby team and women 's Squash teams ... You need to check with the Rugby Club and Aspire .
Thanks Olive !
then i suggest playing tennis in Aspire . PM you
Try Al-Masa Gym , they have a section exclusively for women . You maybe able to network from there . Thier # is : 4781022 -LRB- ask for the ladies section which i think is called Al-Masa Active -RRB-
None . Zip . Zero . Get back to the kitchen .
very helpful ! Lol . .
Seriously I really do n't think there are , if so I 've never heard of them . Your best bet is to try Aspire .
get a thread mill instead , run while watching the news .
Anything from the sea is Hallal ... Allah Allaam .
all the seafood is Halal :-RRB-
one guy write its makroo or somthing like that ; i think he is Hindo or somthing i ` am Arabic Muslim and i ` am eating seafood every day its 100 % Halal
it 's halal u can eat it
of course halal , do n't worry . . anything from sea is halal
Only if you are Qatari or very wealthy . Otherwise Expats can not own anything . My family and I have been here all our lives , in fact my grandfather has been here as long as the country was first discovered . Not allowed to be citizen even if born and raised here . Sad Truth . Qatarization
If you buy a property you will get a Residence Permit to live here but you can not work with that Visa .
@ PQ : This information is not correct , as far as my information is concerned . The Real Estate agents will give you a paper then you are at your own to get the RP from MOI . I have not seen any law that allows expats to get the RP based on their propert
Any first hand experience here ? RP based on Property ?
Non-Qataris may invest and own land , buildings and constructions in three designated projects : Pearl Qatar West Bay Lagoon Al Khor Resort Project Non-Qataris may also acquire rights over : Real estate leased for a term of 99 years , renewable on similar terms . Residential Units for a term not exceeding 99 years , and in general a right to convey property belonging to another person for its own profit , utility or advantage . The law further enhances the desirability of investing in Qatari property by allowing non-Qatari owners to apply for visas and residency for themselves and their families without any local sponsorship .

Hello Kombizz and everyone , I am Egyptian and I bought a 2 bedroom apartment but in the Pearl Qatar . I have got the loan from the bank and it wa smy very good choice to do so as prices started to raise again for rents and for purchaes . Although I felt at the begning that it was risky but now I am coformtable as I am paying the monthly instalment which is less than the rental offcourse for similar size and quality flat . To answer your question , yes there areas where you can buy apartments and it can give a 99 years RP , regardless of your nationality . Secondly , I advise anyone who has the downpayment , to go for purchase not rental specially if he is looking for quality life . . You can contact me for further advice
If you already have a work visa you wont get another RP . My uncle in US owns a property in the Pearl and he got a RP here , but he can not work with that RP . You wont get it automatically you need to summit all related documents and apply for it . Real estate agents help you through the process .
u can not buy a property , u can just lease one
Sir . Fin . Waves , I heard that expats could buy property and get RP for 99 years . not sure if its true but thats what I heard .
I think there was talk that expats could purchase at the Pearl and then would get a long term RP . I 'm not sure anything ever came of that tho .
Sir.fin.unfortunately its sad you live this country for so long and you dont know the facts about this place . Expats CAN buy property is designated areas i.e not only in The Pearl . Its true the cost of an apartment in the Pearl is more than 1M . But you dont necessarily be a millionaire to own one ; banks do give mortgage if you are having a long term contract with very high Salary .
what is a yanni ?
Only can buy on the Pearl and Zig Zag Tower !
You can buy property here . Even in Muntaza area , some time back , Al Asmakh was selling flats . Anyways , you might own the property but you will not get any residence permit against that property . this means , if/when you job is finished from here , you will not able to enter in the country based on your property here . I hope your passport is entitled for on arrival visit visa but things can go bad any time . As Canada 's case ! All the best .
It is with Gulf consolidated , if u buy Nokia mobile above some range , you will get one ticket free for any of the gulf countries . but u need to pay the taxes .
is there any difference in nokia mobile from them I heard like that . Is it really worhthy ?
its not valid on gulf countries , u will get a ticket of india , pakistan , damascus , lebanon , and there are some more m not able to recollect it now , , , as far as its additional taxes its only 110 to 200 qr ... . . this offer is valid on models n97mini , E53 , E63 , E71 , E72 , but not the white colour ... ofE72 ... phewwwww thats all
I would never recomend to go for this offer , its fraud , when you will approach Qatar airways for tickect you will get excusess/rules abut nort the ticket . Its my personal experiance i am victom of previous offer may be one and a half year back .
Bad things like criminals definitely NO . Just did n't clear my debt . Thats it .
If your debt is with X-employer , no issues . If it 's with a bank and if you have good intention of clearing it upon getting a new/better employment - also no problem . -LRB- Banks investigations will ultimately reveal your presence in your current location and details ; they can easily trace and chase you for settlement . Be honest and avoid potential risks -RRB-
Thanks all . Will still wait for more advise and suggestion .
It 's a normal process as far as I 'm concerned . Unless u 've got something to hide ? Just be frank , maybe some of us can help ... good luck
OK , let me be frank . I 'm banned in Abu Dhabi . The question here is , can I work in Doha . I 'm aware that Qatar is part of GCC like UAE . Please help me if you know anything about this .
nothing to worry . . its just a normal procedure for employment visa application . Your ban in abu dhabi is jut for UAE only , so you dont have to worry about it here .
You mean there is no information sharing within the GCC country ? If so , can Qatar deport me ? Appreciate if there are more view on this .
for now . They 're working on a unified GCC database .
So will I have a problem once they unified GCC database ?
absolutely naothing to wory about . . unless u have done bad things in UAE , . my advice is follow ur employers instruction , and stop worrying .
Ever heard of Google ?
I was housed in FOUR SEASONS HOTEL
Hello , and thank you for your replies . I am still in the process so I do n't have all of the particulars yet , but I was told I would be housed in Education City . I looked on the internet and did n't see the accommodations there just maps . Is there a place where I can see the actual apartments that are rented ? Also I was told to bring extra sheets and a blanket ... Can these items be purchased there or should I bring my own ? Thank you for your replies .
I will go and check now .
Ed City should have your housing all set up for you when you arrive . Ours had food in the fridge , even . Mandi
-LRB- We were n't in Ed City housing , but still ... -RRB- Mandi
Mandilulur I sent you a PM . Great it 's good to know he will have lots of friends . He is quite the social butterfly and I would hate to have him there lonely .
I appreciate the information . I am quite excited about this opportunity .
salam if you want change ur sponcer the only thing you can do is just canceld ur visa and be sure it 's cancled then go out and come back business visa you can do that only one year after that you can come to new visa
First you need a NOC letter , no matter what ! Second , even though you worked less than 1 year with the same company it should n't be a problem to transfer the sponsorship from one company to another , ecpesially if your new Company is strong enough . Your nationality is the advantage in this case .
If cancelled , a minimum of 2 year banned will be imposed to you , banning you to come back to Doha . Avoid cancelling your visa and try to convince your sponsor and have a nice conversation to them . be patient and humble always .
mr ammar . . guys do n't mislead the person , if you do n't kow what you are talking about . he CAN NOT just cancel an RP and come back under the business visa ... he wo n't be allowing into the country with NOC letter in the first place ! All he needs is NOC letter .
All Car Manufacturer are selling good car . its depend on your need and your budget . Last week my friend buy 2012 Toyota Furtuner , and I drive it from industrial to his accommodation . Toyota are good and high resale value .
Base on my observation and according to my friends yes it was indeed an excellent 4x4 SUV Car . Toyota has a good reputation , has a high resale value and after sale service is Guaranteed Superb . I have 2008 Model and so far until now it has a good condition inside/outisde and never I had heavy mechanical problem so far . Thanks to God ... It also depend how u used ur car and it a must to bring it to the service center every 5000 km for a service maitenance . Therefore I can highly recommend it to u. : -RRB-
I would never go for a Fortuner ... ! anyways , Toyota always has a good resale . It dosent very much affect where the car is assembled coz they are always made with company brand 's standardization & certification .
Toyota cars are solid and the resale value is good . Go for it .
my fav . is deep-fried steak from chillis ... . .
thanx guys . Fridays , chillies , pandarosa , bennigans all taste the same to me , not mouth watering steaks like Meat company in Dubai and Bahrain and Sizzlers Restaurant in Henry 's Cafe Bar really good . i miss that place already .
Bennigan 's in front of Khalifa Tennis Complex . They can really make my steak medium well .
but since chillis is not an option for you ... . try steak from four season ... . . .
TRY MAJLESS , nr landmark , as u go nr gas station on the corner , FOOD EXERLENT AND CHEAP.DO NICE STEAK IN SAUCE , ENJOY
Honestly , I 've been searching hard for the same thing . I have not tried the South African place at Villagio yet though I 've heard its good . But still , I do n't think its dry aged . I have had steak at the restaurant at the top of la cigale which was actually incredible . Of course it was Wagyu beef and cost about 350 QR but it was comparable to the best steaks I 've had from places like Peter Lugers , Delfrisco 's , etc. .
Try Fridays ... : -RRB-
we tried steak at `` Pompadora '' steak house -LRB- hope the spelling is correct -RRB- on Salwa Road - closer to Ramada - surprisingly it was quite good .
Reach Ramada Signal , to one side you have CHILIES and to the other PONDEROSA .
Diplomatic club has a decent steak place . Also heard that the Golf Club has a good steak restaurant , but I have yet to try that one .
Apple Bees , T.G Fridays and Chillies all these three are the best in Qatar
LoL Bijoy ... that 's the right name ! : -RRB-
Friday 's steak is okay . For a change , have you tried Chicken Espetada at Nando 's , City Center ? They are really good .
Butcher shop

Transfer the loan to your friends who 's needing and willing to continue the car loan .
. . bank will activate their recovery procedures including travel ban , police case etc. and you will not be able to go out of the country until loan settled . If car loan , they will take possession of the car and sell it ; yet , you will have to pay the difference if any , between the sale proceeds and your loan outstanding . .
You are considering borrowing money , and you think there is a high chance you are going to lose your job . And you want to know what the banks can do to get their money back . It 's early in the morning and I am a bit grumpy , but seriously what kind of person are you ? Where are your morals ? If you think you wo n't be able to pay it back . DONT BORROW IT !
Or just do like they did in Dubai ... leave the car at the airport and go ... . i can see TB giving me the blank stare of death : -RRB-
and get yourself a no entry ban all over GCC .
better to have it but it is not mandatory .
after arrival at doha , u can do medical test for visa extn ... ... before no use to do medical .
You dont need a medical for a one week visit . A medical is required if you are going to apply for residence or a long term visit visa . Then you need a medical and it must be done here in Doha
Medical tests are mandatorily required for people coming here to stay for 6 months and more . These are basic tests only . You can go for a complete health check-up if something about your health bothers you .
there is no need for a medical before entering doha for a visit . .

thanks that is slightly more comforting . i was horried to read about people having to lockdown toilet seats and gaps in the windows etc to keep them out so i wasnt sure if this is the general trend and something we should prepare ourselves for.i can imagine myself losing sleep over roaches running on my bed or getting stuck in my hair eeekk ! i understand it is a warm country and a certain amount of tolerance required , not so sure i can accomodate pests in the home though . will have to wait and see .
If you have a villa such problems would be minimal to nil in my experience . In apartments , often the case is no matter how clean you are - your neighbours standards may not be up to yours and the bugs get in . Again , not as if you were living like an unhygenic family , but the bugs know no boundaries .
Mel1 as a Saffer myself , I can guarantee you will see no more cockroaches crawling around your house here , than you would see back home :--RRB- Qatar is parktown prawn free ; - P
i am at the company apartment at the mo ... i find i have to wash the floors everyday ... because of the cockroaches ... my house is very clean but unfortunately its the maintenance of the building which is utter crap ... and then some neighbours also certain not clean ... i have been told its pretty normal . . though the cleaner you are the better off course ... i cant wait to move to the villa as i will have a bit more control ... dont despair ... though ... i hateeeeee them so muchhhhh its the worse freaking insect i can put with ... in the UK we had the spiders but heck i managed to get rid of the things here just seems doesnt matter what i do ... you see them every now and then coming from the outside ... ewwwww ... its getting rarer and rarer but it doesnt make it any easier that we have construction site all around us ... you will be fine ... :-RRB- dont worry ... its worth leaving london to come here ... we are portuguese and southafrican who also lived in the UK for many years :-RRB- good luck and enjoy the move :-RRB-
just bring 10 big lizards from UK then if you got a three rooms villa just put each room with two lizards and 1 in the kitchen , 1 in the sala and in the bathroom ...
Mel1 ! a warm welcome to qatar . To be 100 % sure you do n't confront these stupid bugs , I suggest you to ensure that your villa is newly constructed , ie you are going to be the first occupant . Also ensure that it has been furnished with new furnitures and not the refurbished or that are shifted from somewhere where it was in use . If the furniture is new , the chances of bed bugs welcoming you will be minimal . During your tenure here , keep your kitchen oil free -LRB- difficult ! -RRB- and maintain overall hygiene and you will be well off . All in all qatar is a small and beautiful country . Just make sure you do n't introduce few new species in qatar . : -RRB-
I hate CCs they scare shits outta me
Hello ! Well pests do exist everywhere and Qatar is no exception.The general standard of cleaniness is fairly good here and surely wont dissapoint.If you are goig to live in a compound then will be maintainance and cleaning as well.So no worries there .

No , do n't drink and drive unless you 're one of ` those ' .
Yeah , I saw it with my own eyes !
yes , I would agree that if you do n't have your family here , homesickness will really struck you . Now if there is a possibility that you can bring your family , better . If not , try to indulge yourself to recreation inside the community , a lot in Dukhan . And I will introduce you to some of my friends who are residents there so you wo n't get bored . Having a lot of friends will drive your homesickness away ! When you arrived here , let 's talk , I work there but does not live there . `` I 'm back , simple as that ''
So 100 % agreement from the first two . Nothing to do then except get drunk and by the time you wake up you 'll home sickness will be gone ... Why not try and embrace the culture ? Buy a White land cruiser , get 10 maids , drinks lots of coffee and be late for work and leave early . It 's easy yanni !
What are the activities at Dukhan ?
Actually its my 1st time to work abroad & be away with my family all the while i thought i will be very lonely here but fortunately , the company ive been working with employed many filipinos too & befriend them ... just be strong & think that the reason y we are here is for our family ... With the help of internet connection i can talked to my families whenever i want too ... so i would suggest that u keep ur connection with ur family thru chatting & have some friends here :-RRB- So be strong friend !!! Think positive : -RRB-
Spend your free time with good friends that will keep you company and at the same time help you forget feeling `` homesick '' we left back home . . I do believe this is really important for us to go on each day without them and try to have fun as much as we want to ...
migtysolomon ... thanks for advice , well where in dukhan are you assigned , im going there this sunday hope to get in touch with you .
And they have illicit relations with whores from Bahrain .

Are you referring to Qatari Pirates or to Qataris in general ?

I refer to a class of Qatari Muslims who do what they want .

for the form or go to immigration in Gharaffa and there are people there who will type/prepare document for a very small fee . Initially they will give you a family visit visa good for one month and if you really want to extend for another five months , then he has to go for medial clearance within seven days upon arrival . But still , approval of extension still depends upon the mood of the people in the immigration at the time of application ! Good luck !
yes u can , `` family visa '' go direct in MOI fill a form and they will give u 3 months visa and you can extend upto 3 months ...
will good luck , unless they change the law without me knowing anything about it ... you ca n't sponser a son for six months family visa if he is over the age of 20 ... you can have him on a visit visa . goodluck
As far as I was aware you ca n't sponsor males over a certain age on a family visa . I believed the age was 18 , but you could get special permission up to the age of 21 . Explain the situation to immigration - maybe they can give you an alternative way to get him here . Possibly an extended visit visa .
was 19 and i was told that he could not be sponsored by me .
Poor guy is asking about the visit visa what has family visa got to do with the topic do n't confuse him and pls stick to the topic avoid misguiding/confusion
maybe what you mean is validity of entry period ?
The question was : Can i sponsor 23 yr old son for 6 months ? I was told that i could not sponsor my 19 yr old son for 6 months . yaksbunt , sorry if that is confusing .
for family visit visa . You are the one confused . She was asking for her son -LRB- son is part of family -RRB- , so if you can not contribute something positive , just keep quiet !
i believe that after a boy is 18 there is rule that the father can not sponsor him on a permanent visa but can get a visit visa . and those who are still under their dads sponsor before turning 18 have to trf to a company or prove that they are still students to continue to have this status ... i have no idea if this applies to all nationalities but i had this problem with my 20yr old ...
17 and came back for a second visit when he turned 19 . But again , it all depends on the approving party . There is no harm in accomplishing an application and submitting it . You only pay when it is approved . If it is rejected , you wo n't pay anything !
3 months `` family visa '' come on guys try to check from ur HR maybe they can give advice ...
for every rules there an exemption ... just give valid reason coz my untie have diabetes and they used that as a reason ... got it ...
ok i take back what i said you are not looking for a RP for your son you are only looking for a six months family visit ... you can get the six months and you can get a nother two so is that the total of eight months ... when you go to the immigration office outside you can ask the typers for the form to be typed for you it would cost you three qr and you take it inside door four and they will take your paper and ask you back in one to two weeks.what is you going to need are a NOC paper from your sponcer a letter for a salary and a copy of your passport
i guess it varies on a case to case basis ... yeah flor like u said no harm in trying ...
y not u can sponsor him
bahahahaha

Appreciate the attitude ,
Silverstar , read and think before responding . I presented the question `` what if '' for discussion . There is no statement indicated . Ayishamatull . A friend of mine had a similar situation as yours . He was told to have his RP application cancelled before the new company can proceed . The situation is pending so ca n't give you a firm answer as yet .
Good luck ... There will be no ban till you get the Qatar ID . Be rest assured ... you can exit and re enter on another company 's visa ... absolutely no worries and very authentic and accurate information ... Best of luck
As long as visa -LRB- RP -RRB- is not stamped on your a passport , you are safe . Exit & come back on new visa .

sorry carol forgot to mention dr kumar is located at this clinic called healthspring near doha modern indian school , around abu hamour !
Carol , Look if you have quite enough budget / insurance Check Dr. Attiya in Al Ahli Hospital , . You required to get appointment because this doctor have a long quee . follow this link to get more info . http://www.ahlihospital.com/index.php/pediatrics/
Try looking at Al Ahli hospital . They got goood doctors . But I hope you have enough budget or an insurance card holder .
Hi carol , it appears from your post that you have not been to a govt hospital , then it 's a bit presumptuous to state that govt hospitals are unreliable . It all depends upon the kind of treatment your looking for . There is a pediatrician in al shefa poly clinic in hilal area , who is good . I have also visited the doctor in Medcare centre , in hilal , but was not quite satisfied . Take care .
Forget about Al Ahli Hospital !!! They charge QR500 only for consultation and the doctors are useless !!! I live here 7years and have 3 kids raised in Qatar , and i promise you , Al Ahli is NOT the way to go . There is a good doctor , a female right behind the Aramex office close to Decoration RB . I think its family medical centre . Then there is Future medical Centre opposite Villagio , i went there twice with my youngest , was ok , not Super keen with their treatment . It depends why you need to see a doctor . If your child just have a normal cold , Al SAAD medical Centre is Great ! I dont have good experiance with any other gov. clinic , but can take my hat off for the Al SAAD branch ! I know by experience and have many friends that will sware by them . If your child just have a regular cough , due to the change in weather its likely due to an alergiec reaction to the dust in the air , they will prescribe you with antihestamine = Zyrtec and then a very good and herbal cough syrup = Prospan , these two are all you need every time you kid passed through a viral flu . welcome and good luck . Hope my info help .
Yup charlepunt , go to a private clinic or to a health centre , if it 's a viral infection or the seasonal flu , they will give you paracetamol , prospan , anti histamine and if the infection has been there for some time , then they will add a antibiotic to it . So it all depends upon what kind of treatment you are seeking . By al sadd medical centre , are you referring to the ped emergency centre ?
Very good Hospital at cheapest rate . Try once .

Souk Najada is just behind the DSM -LRB- Doha Share Market -RRB- Dsm is located along Grand Hamad Street . If you come from Sofitel Hotel along Al Musheirib , just go straight like going to Grand Hamad and just after the roundabout to your right before reaching GHamad , the souk is right there opposite souk waqif.Dont look for the bed inside the souk , go behind the souk outside , they are aligned along the road ... hope this helps &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> '' <em> <strong> There 's nothing we can do to change the past , if it teaches you a lesson profit from it then , forget it .

There are quite a few currencies that the banks will not exchange at the moment . No doubt the number will increase as those countries economies move from inflation to deflation and then full blown depression . With the crisis in Gaza the region is quite nervous add to that the global economic crisis , the banks are not in a panic but they are being ultra cautious . Also , the slow internet issue has sparked off a lot of conspiracy theories . But the coincidence of banks being careful , stopping currency exchange , the military build up 1,500 klms away from here , and communications being a problem is worth considering . Not all banks have reacted yet but my sources indicate : - CURRENCY BUY / SELL Bangladesh Taka 0.000000 Algerian Dinar 0.000000 Egyptian Pound 0.000000 Jordanian Dinar 0.000000 Lebanese Lira 0.000000 Srilankan Rupee 0.000000 Nepalese Rupee 0.000000 Philippine Peso 0.000000 Pakistan Rupee 0.000000 Syrian Lira 0.000000 Yemeni Riyal 0.000000
SM-Malls and Banks in the Philippines are NOT buying Qatari Riyals ... I tried it myself , they only accept Saudi Riyals . You can sell it at any Money Changers , just be careful ! Have your `` common sense '' functions properly . . before , during and after selling . Get my point ?
thanks for the reply soniya . . ^_^
Thanks Sonia . NOC is realy a burden to us
You do n't need any NOC ... just go ahead
No need NOC from your previous employer . We have the same situation before , i had cancelled my visa to my employer and go back to my country and then my husband process my family visa . Now , i 'm already here in Qatar for 1.5 months I finished my medical and finger prints . i 'm just waiting for my pataka to be released .
Just relax ... You can come here on FAMILY VISA and can start working again without NOC from your previous employer ...
is it applicable for husband also ? if wife transfered her visa/or her visa is under a company sponsership ? Husband cancelled his visa , go to native palce/country and come back to qatar under wife 's sponser ship and join other company ? is it possible ?
can i know the procedure on how i will transfer my sponsorship to my husband , im coming back to Doha as family visit for 6mos , what are the requirements to transfer it to family visa or husband sponsorship?do i still need NOC from my previous company ?

I dont have the co. details with me but as soon as I do I will post them . . also try changing ur shampoo and Cond to professional like loreal

Dont get 2 MB speed . Max you should consider is 1MB but for most purposes 512K is fine . Problem is connection to other continents is never fast so no use to get highest speed . When I test connection to North America it is never better than 375KB . Mozaic is not available in all areas . I ordered Mozaic Dec 9 , I asked on Dec 31 where installation guys were . Was told by Qtel that my area would not get it for a `` few '' months . Nice of them to let me know ! NOT ! Get Landline , 512K or 1MB Internet and then Orbit Satellite TV . When Vodafone is in their internet may be better .
512 kbps is a good speed for Home aplication . . As said above . . the 512kbps internet connection will cost you QR200 per month and then the Landline will cost you 33 QR per month ... Altoghether 233QR per month ... There was an offer from Q Tel for Moziac TV ... how ever it is not available in some areas in Qatar as of today ...

You can only apply for a license to sponsor a maid once the family visas are processed and issued . That is the rule in Qatar . And thr whole process takes time .
I like cookies >_<
it takes time as Alumnar has mentioned ...
Wow , thanks to those that offered advice . it was helpful . So we need to have visas first and then she can get hers . My husband is coming to Doha for two weeks after Eid to sort out his visa . How long will it take for ours and then hers or can we all apply together . I shall ignore the other comments as they are not worth responding to .
:O '' Ignore the other comments '' i guess then NO COOKIES FOR YOU Missy >_< hump
How about doing what most women do - clean the house and look after your children yourself ! Call me old fashioned but thats what people used to do or has God given you the right to enslave someone ? Why do u want a maid - so that you can do coffee with the girls ? zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Marhaba . . If you have some free time could you please come and babysit my sick daughter everyday ? Because my body is full of aches and I myself have some serious medical issues . And I do not like or have the right to ENSLAVE anyone.What if some poor slave got some money to feed her family by doing the only work she knows and is capable and confident of doing ... Please respond ...
hhahaha ur wife forgot to buy u the cigs because of X6 :-RRB-
so I could quit smoking ... Insha'Allah ! : D
pseudo smokers are like pimps ... so do these e ciggs have on/off button ?
how can i order they need a mastercard or paypal card . . i dont have one . can u order for me and then ill buy it personal to you ? hehehehe what name of brand ?
aak did you check where i mentioned above ? coz i saw them there with my own 4 eyes !
Thanks Speed , even more reason not to quit smoking now :P either way they are both harmful to health and winners dont quit and quitters dont win :P all is well in the balance of the universe .
Believe it or not , Qatar does not allow selling those in here . They think they are not fully tested against side effects . I have a friend who wanted to get a license to sell those after shipping the various parts separately . Very smart when water vapor 's side effect could be worse than rat poison .
time ... some thru SPEED and some thru SMOKE : - D
OH and no you wont have to pay for customs unless you are buying like a truck load of it perhaps .
haha tthanks ... ive been searchng here in DOHA . .

`` Is it any good as the real deal ? '' No , it 's even worse for you !
of course i know the meaning literally but is there any difference being a faithful or being loyal , what would you choose .
Cant we choose both lol
No need of exit permit if under husband 's sponsorship .
no need . but still u need a ticket to travel . LOL
no need of any paper or permission .
kuriji means the permission of the person who is your sponser yours husband must give kuruji to u other wise u cant go any were
Take your passport with you and a ticket that 's all
Some interesting confusing answers , as usual .
U could follow me once and save the track on your GPS ... since have never used the GPS ...
Just drive south when you reach sealine - however only go there if have a buddy in another 4 by 4
Just a proof of you and your sister being siblings will do -LRB- birth certificate , passport -RRB- .
If she is entering the country on your sponsorship , ofcourse once you get Ok from the ministry that means you are qualified sponsor as brother and it is ok even to have a same appartment . If she is entering and working in this country on her own -LRB- visa from different sponsor -RRB- then you guys just need to keep the necessary proofs handy IF and when required ... That is out of my best knowledge . All the best
No issues as far as both of the passports show common parents and similar surnames
When applying for ur sister 's visa , the only proof would be a copy of ur passport as well as ur sisters ' . Cos , of the surename , home address and parents names , they can confirm the relationship b/w u guys . And der aitn any problem with housing ur sister here in Qatar .
if your are a guy , try to keep hair as short as possible ... if your are a girl , not sure what to do ... cheers
You ca n't stop it but you can reduce it by take bath in cold water . formula is -LRB- 2 mug cold water + 1 mug normal water -RRB- = standard water for shower , you can change the ratio as per your choice , I am sure you will get result . also save your head by wearing cap when you are outside in the day time
You can try looking for a shampoo with hair fall control and use normal temp water when bathing .
In my experience you can reduce hair falling by using cold water for shower . Regards
Store tap water in container for next day 's use . :-RRB-

and how will they know you have a one way ticket at the airport ?
it is none of their business at the check-in counters to know if you have a return ticket or not , or if you 're coming back or not , it 's entirely your prerogative . If you need an excuse , `` I am undecided on my date of return , so I will book it online when I feel it 's time to come back '' ; - -RRB-
your already have exit visa dear ... so no worries ... they dont care if u will come back or not ... what important is u have a plane ticket going home ...
NO - the check in staff will not bother about if you have any outstanding dues -LRB- not saying that you have -RRB- . And the Immigration Officers wo n't give a damn about if you do n't have a return ticket , they only stop you if you 're on repatriation and have outstanding dues .
All you need is the exit visas and your tickets to leave ! Many companies issue tickets for the workers to come back while they are on holiday - it is a common practice and we have done it many times . How easy it is for some people to jump to conclusions that you are running away from debts - just ignore those comments and good luck for your next adventure , wherever it may be : -RRB-
If you have no plans to return , why not simply resign and do the right thing by the company ? Doing a runner simply screws up the visa entitlements for someone else who might enjoy it here .
Baldrick , although I agree with you , maybe Pierre 's company does not want him to leave ?
who 's coming your way to get one-way air ticket , further its upto you come back of not ! if company is paying u with return ticket . fly home & no need to come back !
B2D - most ` bosses ' are not like you and you know that . Your word ` voluntarily ' shows your respect for your workers -LRB- which is to be praised -RRB- . The OP seems to have more serious issues to be able to break free from his sponsor - and with children he needs to make sure to get back to the UK for the new school term , spend Christmas at home and and and ... Things which are very important to people like him and many others . Sometimes people just snap when the family is not happy - and even 1 week can be like HELL if you do n't want to be where you are .
Even u can try by booking the return ticket nd u can cancel the same from ur home country
one-way ticket when going for vacation and our company do the booking of the return trip upon request . So the one-way ticket is not an issue . It 's the EXIT permit that is very important !
the immigration will not ask for your return tickets ... unless you have a cancelled visa and they are prompted by the banks that you have loans and obligations
do what i do ... i got to supermarkets and ask them for the cartons they are about to throw away .

Problem with Nestle Water is that they have one of the highest content of Sodium in their water -LRB- which is unhealthy for you -RRB-
oh really ? Did not realize that ! which one would you recommend ?
NOmercy . Its true . . Nestle has the highest sodium percentage . Try Rayyan
Even HAMAD Medical uses and certifies them as the Best as it contains d lowest amount of Sodium and other minerals in Right Percentages .
Try ARWA ...
I 'm using Al Manhal and the water sodium is medium , and the taste is not bad . Once a week delivery though unless you call -LRB- they will delivery 1-2 more depending on how low your family is -RRB- . Their prices are the same as taking an empty container to the market and dragging a full one back , but delivered to your door ! My roommate also uses Wataniya , which for the first month is super service , multiple times a week . Then seems to not be so super . But that could be that they changed to one to two times a week delivery and my roommate never knew -LRB- he also puts them out too late when most of the service starts 6-8am -RRB- . The differences between the two is Al Manhal sometimes delivers leaking overused bottles , and Wataniya 's bottles almost 100 % look brand new . Wataniya 's taste is n't quite as good as Al Manhal 's but still not bad at all .
Banana cake , low sodium and smooth water to the troat is TANOURINE . I am not use if the supplier can provide water dispenser ... I am only buying 1.5 L
better to try them all , then deside
plz find me the fiji water supplier in doha
Randomly choosing water by taste is n't going to determine whether it is healthy or not .
I drink the water that drips from the A/C . It 's absolutely pure and free of sodium .

what i know is ... MES Indian School accepts !!!
I was also moved from Dubai , I was looking the same answer with good school names
yes . it is possible . if u want indian school , then DPS , Birla school , MES and Ideal Indian school will accept . and if u want any other national school like lebanese , french , then u need to consult .
Lack of seat available at international schools nowadays . But if you have big budget , I dont think it would be a problem . Let 's say you can try at american school , doha college , give them a call first . I tried for my son also for some indian schools , last August ... mmm no luck ! -LRB- or may b because we are Pakistani -RRB- ???
thanks all of you , guy ! it make me less thinking about that . My daughter follows the British curriculum school . So I will try with some good school -LRB- that i have known on this forum : DESS , PHS , ... -RRB- if can not i will try others . this forum is fantastic !

Correct . And as a result of the cash being withdrawn banks will really collaps . -LRB- 1929 and 1986 -RRB-
The AIS which insures loans and credit of banks internationally just posted a quarterly loss of 64 billion US $ . The US government jumped in with a 30 Billion US $ ` bail-out ' . If AIS goes down , most internationally operating banks will loose their insurances on default credits .
HSBC down 70 % .
This is what 's happening with HSBC at home -- US http://money.cnn.com/2009/03/02/news/international/HSBC_jobcuts/index.htm?postversion=2009030212
HSBC is one of the more secure banks these days . I do not believe it is ailing .
did you read todays newspapers Hasan ?
MD it is AIG not AIS !!
Dear Cynbob and Stealth , HSBC is doing fine . And better than most banks in the world . Just closing a division does not mean that the bank is in trouble .
Dweller is incorrect : HSBC in Qatar is NOT a franchise . HSBC Qatar is a Branch of HSBC Bank Middle East Ltd. , which is chartered in Jersey . It is -LRB- though a series of intemediary holding companies -RRB- wholly owned by HSBC Holdings PLC , the top level holding company for HSBC . That being said , it is NOT a branch of the UK HSBC Bank , nor is it a subsidiary of the UK HSBC Bank . The Jersey bank is supervised by the Jersey regulator and the top level holding company is supervised by the UK FSA on a consolidated basis . Should you take comfort in all of that ? I leave it up to you , but it is a part of HSBC in more than name only .

Somehow the thought of hitting , even lightly , another 's child is just wrong . For teachers there are many better ways to discipline a child than resorting to the kinda corporal punishment our teachers used . Now that was quite brutal and far from bettering us it certainly encouraged naughty kids like I was to be more naughtier as a form of revenge and defiance .
We are now in hi-technology era . . accept it , our current children time is different from what we have 50 years ago .
In today 's day i think we should just take away their Facebook privileges :P
Modern education spoils creativity ??? I seem to be living in another world altogether !!!! Agree with both Mimi and Fatimah . Whilst Im against harsh disciplining a smack once in a while when the situation demands it is ok . Then again when your kid becomes a teen then begin the ` tyrannical ' years ! They will say I HATE U atleast once a day cuz we dont allow them to be ` like their friends ' or ' their moms allow them ' ... :-RRB- At the end of the day depends on your rapport with your child .
Not always Marco . And do you have kids ??? I hope not ! Esp with that attitude !
I think parents should smack their children whenever wherever , we 're meant to be together . . Errrr ... sorry lost the track Jokes apart . . I do n't see anything wrong with parents smacking their kids `` occasionally '' and when necessary . . but again do not punish your children in front of others because that would make them feel humiliated and ultimately go rebellious.I have seen many arab -LRB- parents -RRB- smacking their children in public like malls and parks etc. which in my opinion is TOTALLY wrong . . Otherwise , all is good . . i got punished a lot as a kid . . but look at me now . . All the girls love me . . i can still take some smacking from my father . . :P
I still like to be smacked on my hot bum . . any mothers like to volunteer ?
9pm ? Hav been trying for long to sleep by tat time , but usually get to bed by 9 and sleep by 10:30 pm ... : -LRB-
Smack That !
i think whacking the children stiffles the creativity and makes them scared to think of new ideas . However i think if used sparingly and with the other righ ingredients -LRB- coaching , love ... -RRB- , it can be helpful .
I was talking about parents smacking their kids . . teachers on the other hand are a big No No . On that note . . when i was smacked for something i did wrong i always found other creative ways to do more naughty things so that should answer your question . : P
Modern education system spoils the creativity of children ? Where did you get that from ?
Agree with you Fatimah , the occasional smack , on the right occasion , can work . But totally against teachers smacking kids . Smacking is a serious punishment and should n't be given out lightly , and it needs to come from a loving parent .
Agree with TDKR and Tinkerbell10 ... `` Modern education spoils creativity ??? I seem to be living in another world altogether !!!! or where did you hear that ? '' . ... :-RRB- As for smacking , I dont think either at school or at home it is required unless the parents give up on children for any reason . As I understood , as I grew , time & patience was the key with parents . And so never got smacked either at home or at school . There were tough sessions specially with parents but they were patient enough to tell me or my brother and sister their POV listening to our POV , without the mindset that they being eldest are only right and at times these sessions would run for days without any hostility or bad feeling .
Smoke . . Sorry , I 'm no mother , but people like to call me daddy . . and i 'd love to kick your bum
@brit yes i read about that yesterday . did n't know it was allowed in US to ` paddle ' the student if they do something wrong and they agreed to be paddled or whatever . i agree with the bit of ` smacking ' tho but not to the extent that your kid will ju
What dose modern education produces ? So very much confused students , and badly trained educators . the quality of education in the classroom has gone so low so much that student no longer have to conform to classroom general rules and standards . School going students now days can be asked very basic questions of their subjects and not be able to answer
I believe all kids should be whacked when they do something wrong ... its the way our forefathers brought us up and look how good we turned out : P
So true Smokie !!! How come everyone today is too much of a Hussy to smack their kids around ? -RRB- :

The Best is Karwa Driving school , dont go for anywhere else
I got my license thro Karwa ... Good training ... Better go for karwa . .
KARWA is the best . On the face of it , other private driving schools seem cheaper , but , you may end up spending a lot more money during training / driving test . At KARWA , they even take the cost of driving license upfront -LRB- QR 250 -RRB- . The training is also structured , and , very good
karwa is the best

Please dont ask such vulgar questions on this site as its been viewed by families as well . When you know that this is a muslim country and things like this are banned here then how can you ask such a question where people sell these nonsence things ... when its ban by law then no1 has the authority or right to sell this bullshit things here.so please dont bring such stupid things on the website by supporting a fake reason .

No toys but you can buy edible body paint , handcuffs , role-play outfits in several shops in City Centre .
Your best bet would be online ... But you may have difficulty getting to the websites that do offer this stuff . > myviews08 , This is a real question for someone looking for real answers ! Yes this is a family friendly site but that means parents need to moniter what their children are looking at on here as well as the rest of the internet . Your view of this question are not helpful or required , why did you feel you needed to chime in with your views or even open this question .
Adding to `` BINK187 '' In addition , nothing is against Islam . . I 'm a Muslim and i did n't see any part in our Holy Quraan that says Adult toys is Haram -LRB- forbidden -RRB- In fact , God has permitted to the husband and wife to enjoy each other to the maximum . If you have any proof that it 's Haram , please enlighten me . . Otherwise , do n't be such a punk following others cuz they say it 's haram . .

Answer is absolutely NO ... a big NO . . Noone can switch job from one to another in doha without having NOC from previous sponsor/employer ...
Come on man , are you expecting something special for you ?
lol . . you said you have been here for two years and you do n't know the answer for that . . it is NO ... . you have to have an NOC ... or you stay out of Qatar for two years .
try to negotiate with them .
You can use tuner liquid to remove this kind of thinks and use hard brash . Regards ,
if you go to a hardware store ask for Thinner , , , the stuff you clean brushes or dilute acrylic paint . Whatever chemicals you try , test it first on the surface so you do not damage it further .
I think it is difficult to remove with any type of chemicals . Just lay new carpets -LRB- nice thick plastic carperts -RRB- or cermic tiles in the areas where it is removed . Also , I think removing using chemicals is very tiresome job . Regards .

Maybe just call Qtel and find out what the problem is ? I pay for a 4MB line and actually connect at 4.8 M down / 650k up . Its not blazing fast compared to the western world , but for what it is I can connect to torrents upward of 500k per second . Qtel also offers an 8M line , but there is a restriction on the distance to the local hub . I think they said 800m and mine just happens to be ~ 1200m away . The tech on the phone did inform me they are working on Fiber Optic , but would not be available for another year -LRB- which probably means 2 in Doha time -RRB- . You can get up to 50MB download speeds in the US with Fiber internet . The biggest problem here is the pricing . Qtel charge a whopping 400QAR for a 4MB line . Anywhere else this speed can be had for a fraction of the cost . Even 5 years ago I was paying the equivalent of ~ 150QAR for a 4MB line in the US . Prices here are absolutely rediculous !

All you need is a receiver connected to the PC , PCI or USB , and a dish . Service providers are numerous on the Internet .
It 's not illegal . You are using the dish as if you used satellite TV .
Hey , man , and Q-Tel can not censor the Internet !
Yes it is available . Beverley Hills Tower in West Bay used to have it for all apartments there . No idea of provider or costs though .
The average price in the US is 50 $ per month for 1 Mb data transfer . Prices depend if it 's one-way or two-way . A dedicated two-way connection with unlimited data transfer is around 250.000 US $ per month . If you really want to know , search the Internet .

Thank you everybody , i do eppreciated all the answers you have given me . i got my both hand painted by an Indian lady finally.It 's beautiful , but after couple days i got scared look at my own hand -- feel like something strange has happened to them -- i can not get used to it . i do n't know how long this henna gon na last .
Almost every salon can do this for you ... its more of a walk in service and is very quick . You can go to a general salon or a specialized henna salon . Some good ones are Rehab in Matar -LRB- on the right after the Lulu building -RRB- , Mallika at Ramada Junction -LRB- in the Ramez/Mandarin complex -RRB- . Hilton in Al Sadd -LRB- in the Nandos complex -RRB- is brilliant and they focus solely on henna . You are guaranteed excellent service and colour and there are so many attendants . We have gone over with a whole wedding party and had everyone dealt with really quick . If you are looking for someone to come over to your place though , that is a little hard . What exactly is it that you need ?? I do henna and MAY be able to help
beea is right and if u want to lady at your place then every one has diff.charges.i can also help u but at my place , my tele ph is 4693546 .
no dear . We r living here for 29 years almost . But incidents take place every where , but believe me u 'll find safe here . Think + ve and b + ve . . so relax and feel free to come here . Welcome hn advance .
Qatar is one of safe country in the world , and I am sure who are living in Qatar can be witness However , for Dubai , I know it superficially only and I can not confirm or deny
In some case , it could be true if you have fallen into a sponsor who is actually a pimp . Examples are sponsors who employs for waitress job at hotels and pubs . The actual job done would be a flesh trade .
I felt safe and secured here ... same applies to single women . Kids can play on the streets with no problem . You can even walk with your jewelery on . Always be positive and you will be OK . Welcome to Doha . .
Not true . Qatar is one of the safest country in the world .
I do n't think you can hold two GCC Visa , unless it is the same company you are working for and they apply the visa , i think you would have to cancel Dubai visa in order to get your Qatar visa stamped on your passport . This is what i have also only heard , so please get it confirmed .
First You have to cancle Dubai Visa and all bank loans ect . will be cleared and there will not be any case/charge against you in dubai . Then you can get Qatar or other GCC residence/work visa . None can keep both same time .
no you ca n't hold both RP at same time .
You HAVE to cancel your UAE Visa 100 % sure as I joined Qatar recently from Dubai . Otherwise your company will make you travel back to Dubai at your expenses to get your UAE visa cancelled . Same happened to two guys who joined with me from Dubai . So dont take chance . I am 100 % sure .
Hello ` rp31 ' You had mentioned that 2 people had to return to uae to cancel their uae visa before qatar RP was processed . Could you please confirm whether they were in managerial visa in uae PLUS a similar visa in qatar . Thanks
Qatar has very strict traffic laws , now more than any where else in the world but i still see some people excersing rash driving . Nothing has changed in the driving trends it is the same .
But the guy above did ... They getting seriouus finally ... You ca n't teach experience ...
adnanmzfr - they may have strict laws -LRB- though personally I do n't think they 're particularly strict compared to other countries -RRB- but they 're all pretty much pointless as they 're not enforced by the police .
vegas , this rule is for real long ago , and now , more real LOL ! &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> '' <em> <strong> There 's nothing we can do to change the past , if it teaches you a lesson profit from it then , forget it . '' </strong> </em> </p>
`` cops waving people over who were talking with the cell phone and kids loose in cars '' If that 's the case then good . It 's already illegal to use your phone while driving and illegal not to have seatbelts on all passengers . I hope they are starting to properly enforce it now .
This `` rule '' exists only on paper !
Saw Landcruiser at busy intersection on Al Waab yesterday with father driving with toddler on his lap and a zillion other kids jumping around all over the place inside . Yes , I know it 's nothing new , but it really is time the police enforced the law concerning this . That kid would just have been mince if he 'd had an accident . Makes me want to cry .
In a major move to curb the growing number of accidents and incidents of reckless driving on Qatars roads , the government yesterday promulgated a new Traffic Law , stipulating severe penalties for violators including a point system which would ultimately lead to the cancellation of a habitual offenders driving license . Decree No 19 of 2007 , issued by HH the Deputy Emir and Heir Apparent Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani , stated that a driving license may be suspended for three months when the total violations reached 14 points for the first time . If the same person gathered 12 points again , his license would be suspended for six months , nine months on the accumulation of the next 10 points and one year for the next eight points . Ultimately , a driving license may be cancelled if the same offender earned six points for the fifth time . The penalty for using mobile phones while driving has been enhanced . The violator will have to pay a minimum fine of QR 3,000 and a maximum fine of QR 10,000 . He is also liable for imprisonment for up to one year . Motorists who commit violations such as driving with no authorized license , driving under the influence of liquor , driving in the opposite direction of traffic flow , escaping from the accident site , causing sound and air pollution and exceeding the speed limit would be punishable by imprisonment from one month to three years or fined QR10 ,000 to 50,000 or both . According to the new law , the punishment for the following offences are also the same as mentioned above : Not wearing seat belts , allowing children below 10 years sit in the front passenger seat , not giving way to official motorcades and the vehicles of the police , civil defense and ambulances , not leaving enough space between two vehicles and motorcyclists allowing another passenger sit behind them -LRB- pillion riding -RRB- . The law stipulates that the driver and the front seat passenger should wear seat belts all the time . Cyclists should keep to the right side of the road and should ride in one line . Motorcyclists are not allowed to ride on one wheel . Both should wear helmets . Violation Points System Violators of traffic rules will be given negative points as follows : Jumping the red light 7 Driving in the opposite direction 6 Driving under the influence of alcohol 6 Exceeding the maximum speed 4 Driving recklessly and dangerously 4 Driving with defective brakes 4 Driving with inappropriate license 3 Driving with stripped or invalid license 3 Violating norms of public morality 3 Driving an unregistered vehicle 3 Driving a vehicle without number plates 3 Unauthorized changes made to number plates 3 Providing wrong information to pass the technical inspection 3 Using the vehicle for the wrong purpose 3 Blocking the flow of traffic intentionally 3 Driving a vehicle without a proper silencer 3 Driving a polluting vehicle 3 Driving a vehicle that leaks any material that can damage the road 3 Driving a vehicle which drops loads which can endanger the public safety 3 Driving on the embankment 3 Making a wrong U-turn 3 Changing a vital part of the vehicle without a written permission from the authorities 3 Giving the license to someone who has no license 2 Driving a vehicle with unclear number plates 2 Driving with only one number plate , or changing their shape or detail 1 Refraining from giving driving license to traffic police 1 Trucks violating the load conditions 1 Trucks violating the width , length , or weight regulations of the vehicle 1 Driving a technically unsafe vehicle 1 Using lights , horns , microphones , or other machines against the law 1 Disobeying traffic signs 1 -LSB- img_assist | nid = 417 | title = leo dude | desc = happiness comes only once dont miss it | link = none | align = left | width = | height = 0 -RSB-
HAve to say this one covers pretty much anything `` Violating norms of public morality 3 '' It will only be an issue for non locals anyway . `` The penalty for using mobile phones while driving has been enhanced . The violator will have to pay a minimum fine of QR 3,000 and a maximum fine of QR 10,000 . He is also liable for imprisonment for up to one year '' The above is a joke.I have seen 4 Police officers either calling or texting when driving . So to sum up , Waste of time . The worst drivers will not get penalised .
How long is a piece of string . It 's taken me 17 years so far for very little result . It depends on your ability , capability and willingness .
it depends on your aims . for understanding the whole grammar and be able to talk in the streets and for a basic understanding of what you 've read you will need a whole year with 2 - 3 hours daily along with a lot of exercises at home . if you are a beginner i would suggest that you join the arabic classes in fanar building close to corniche . they have four levels . these levels will be enough for you as a beginner .
there are many private institutes offering arabic courses . If you are in govt/semi-govt entity you can join the Language Institute . Learning a language depends on your interest , effort and capability .
Hay I know ... How long is a piece of string ... DAaaaa
do not beleave others a rabic is like drinking water it is only up on interest you have to tray and tray u well do it
Friend , since i do not know arabic but i learn a lot of sentences and words only through verbal interation whch means Arabic is very easy language . In my opinion u can learn it within 3-4 months provided u have to devote yourself 2 hours daily . U can join FANAR center -LRB- building with spiral shape tower -RRB- near Al-fardan , infront of Irani market , Doha.They have nominal charges -LRB- Approx QR . 400 only for 3 months -RRB- If u need further assistant pls ask me through e-mail All the best my friend .
An Arabic girlfriend who does n't speak any other language will teach you quickly !
You can find some interesting tutorials for English to Arabic at www.youtube.com .
Fanar teaches written Arabic . After 5 levels and many months you will have a vocabulary of about 300 words , not enough to speak . You will need to choose a dialect and focus on the spoken language . I did an immersion course - 10 hours a day , six days a week for 8 weeks and I am conversational .

Do you mean re-install Windows ? If yes , copy all datas to any other storage device first . Then boot from the software CD . Try to use original software .
Rebooting means restarting your PC . . is it asking for a restart or a reformat or something else . . Reboot has no harms . .
If can i click yes option ?
reboot = restart ? not reinstall windows , format etccc ... ?

i had a similar problem with my connection . Qtel was able to prove that my bandwith was 1 mbps and they doubted my wifi router instead ... however i googled it and found out that if i was using a wireless router and it was positioned near a cordless phone or a microwave , it would reduce my bandwidth and so i removed my cordless phone from next to the router and now i get the full quota of the bandwidth . Lem me know if u have any questions
Not allowed .
i dont think you can find one , but go to centerpoint , 1st floor . u can find the entire furniture and electronics . can chk the price .
Thanks for the suggestion . Problem is I 'm not in Qatar yet ;-LRB- Cheers SK
There really is n't any websites here like you are describing . There is no Ikea or Best Buy either . No Wal Marts , Targets , things of that nature . I would say if you have to make arrangements for your house before you get here , get a furnished place . You will have to hunt around the malls -LRB- not really any American stores there -RRB- and also the souqs for furnishings . Hope that helps . Motherhood ... The hardest job you 'll ever love ! : -RRB-
Visit www.emaxme.com , they are present in many countries and will atleast give u some idea about electronics .
Hi . Been recently looking at accomodation and the costs between furnished and unfurnished . In my opinion it is better to rent unfurnished . The difference in some places is 1000-2000QR a month . Over a year -LRB- 12 000 -RRB- you could quite easily buy your own . Whatever you vividly imagine , Ardently desire , Sincerely believe and Enthusiastically act upon , Must inevitably come to pass .
Home Depot , Revys , Canadian Tire , PepBoys , can someone add further to this list ??
Wake up from the dream . No way
kindly wait till 2022
in your dreams ...
Yes very Soon by Feb 2011 ...
wait till 2050 . .
whatever changes they do it 's going to help in favor of the employer always . employee is always at the receving end . do not expect any big changes in qatar , its only show off here . Its their time now , we can only wait and watch , time will come for everything . they are flying high now , until a strom from no where can bring them on their knees . By implementing a ban period of 2 years , they only proved that they are weak , very weak .
I think Carnegie Mellon do MBAs .
No Rana they do n't have b-com they 've P-com
you can do MBA from the Heriot-Watt Edinburgh Business School its distance learning and they have an approved learning centre here in doha you can take classes there . or if u dont want to join classes you can do it online .
why is Qatar University not accredited ? BTW education city does n't offer any MBA . . cheers , paul
in qatar ... yes , it is ... coz its friday ... ; -RRB-
Yes . Dec-25 -LRB- Friday -RRB- is holiday in Qatar .
obviously no work , it falls on a Friday . . duh . .
Yes this year only for X'mas and New year is Public holiday . Enjoy and thanks to Qatar government .
really nomerci ! . . but thats discrimination ; -RRB-
Well , I suppose it is because local people do not drink alcohol . Ya .
Ya right ; *
Yes ... but only certain brands . . Diesel , Boss . Security usually checks at the entrance .
Thanks unexpected guest , What is the membership fee ?
Call them ??? Actually do n't ... last time I called la Cigale to get that very answer , it was , ` Alo Alllooo , Alo ' ` Good evening is that la Cigale the 5 star hotel ? ' ` yess Allllloo ... ' So it 's 100qr membership + 200qr to get in which includes two drinks ... unless there is a special event and it may cost more
Thanks Oryx . Tres cher . Will try another week ,
You pay for what you get ... drinks same price as irish so it works out at 100qr for entrance it is a 100qr well spent as a social filtre ... or try crystal and wahm at W - free entrance membership 50QR
R u going Paddy tonight ???
What a nice way to ask someone out for a movie ... ; -RRB-
Nice try mate ... : P
Seriously ??? You need a date to watch Jackass ??? LOL !!! Lem me know if its out ... will you buy me bobcorn and bebsi ? : - P
LMAO :P u got me wrong fellas . i aint tryin to date anyone . . i just wanted to know if its out haha , but although i dont wan na go alone lol , and yes colt45 , the greatest date would be a jackass movie LOL
Better go with Colt45 , you will enjoy it .
In Doha , you can have chicken to your heart 's content . * Price = reasonable/easy on the pocket * Quality = commensurate with price / there are many choices of good restaurants * Availability = 24/7
They are no foghorn leghorns , but they serve the purpose . .
Ha - You know about Fog Horn leg horn ? Even to this day when I tell a joke and it bombs I say `` That 's a joke , I say that 's a joke , son ! '' Anyway - I want whole chickens , and I wan na take them home and slow cook them ... They cost about $ 5 here . I love chicken
MP , you will laugh at the size of the teeny-weeny chickens in Doha ! Mandi
Oh no . . I might need 2 a day
You are one weird man .
Do they have Popeyes there ? http://www.popeyes.com/lto.php
and it 's pretty ok , specially compared to KFC . At least IMO . Qatar is the land of chicken and lamb . Plenty of restos around selling em . And the Arabic style rotisserie chicken is both cheap and good . You will be very happy here !
No . There are no visas available easily for persons above 60 years of age . The hotel-sponsored visa is the only type . You need not approach a five-star hotel for this . There are several cheaper hotels in Doha which can sponsor such a visa . The cost would be around US$ 100 to US$ 150 per day , depending upon how much the hotel charges for one room per night .
Agreed with METRO
Got to the Hukoomi website . Once there select the tourist visa section then select a joint tourist visa and fill in the form for each parent , you will need their passport details . I did this last year for my parents , both over 70 . Be careful though as you only get 1 month from the date of creation so make sure it covers them for the whole stay , you can not choose a start date . They give you an instant answer and it only cost 100 riyals per visa . Good luck : -RRB-
Go to Immigration department and ask someone there . I have heard that there are people who can get you a visa for over 60 parents but he will charge you for his service . Please dont send me any PM that 's all I have heard .
have u tried checking in MESSAGE ARCHIVE ?
in yahoo msng u have to first go to preferences , then go to the option archive , there u will have 3 options to save all ur chat or not to save or delete the chat once u sign out . If u 'll select the first option then u can anytime access ur chat history . To view ur chat history go to contacts , there b a tab for message archieve . hope it 'll b helpful : -RRB-
http://www.passwordrecovery.in/password-recovery/yahoo-messenger.asp hi ... tried the path u gave me ... and it is my luck that i did not knew this before and apparently did not have 1st option ticked !!! above is a path to a search engine ... it is advisable to download it ???? pls advice if you know thanks for your reply Rosabel cheers
Errr , Maybe this is a dumb-ass answer , but ca n't you just ask your friend to send the number again ?
@Baldrik : how he get the no . of his friend again when he is saying that only dat no . in chat can help him to talk wid his frnd !!!!!!! there may b many possibilities , but may be his hands r tied off only wid one option i.e Message history ... Rosabel

Is QLSG somewhat related to The Illuminati ???
Yes because it is a social group . Its not Qatar Living Privilege Group . If somebody is not doing well his membership could be cancelled later on like how its happening in coachsurfing and other social groups . This is just my personal opinion .
So you want to join the clowns and jokers too ... the very guys who have lots of time on their hands while at the office to arrange all this cozy little meetings during office hours if they can get away with it .

Yeah they have here in Doha but the sole branch is in Barwa Warka ... its Great American Bagels Bakery . .
Yes yes yes . . try in megamart . . -LRB- :

Yes of course ...
go to airport immigration dptmnt and give ur id to check there s any travel bann . if there is nothing u can travel otherwise u have to finish the problem .
You have to finish it prior departing . otherwise you can not obtain even exit permit from your company .
He can not go out of doha untill he finish his case from polish Or CID
I was involved in a networking site , their I met a guy and chat with him as a gay later we exchanged the contact no and promise to meet and I was caught by CID as he is a spy . I dont know the case was treated as minor or major . During interrogation they taken my signature in a document , which I couldnt understand as it was in arabic language and they take my pics and freed . Actually m in delimma to quit the job or go for a vacation . if the case is major then during the process of visa cancellation my company knows abt it and it was leak to everyone and sure i ll loose all my benefits . and if i ll go for my vacation and resign then also my company will not pay my benifits . please give advice
My friend can i ask you ? , why you are signing the document & you have n't got the idea of what was the content of it ? This is serious matter , my opinion 1 day you will be arrested so better to go there and check it to the immigration if theres a travel ban issued to you & try to go to the court & present your QID there & ask if theres any case filed against you cause sometimes the trials may proceed without you & they will just arrest you when the decision came out ...
Thanks to all for your advice , so according to you all i hav to check in immigration dept any travel ban issued or not , if not i can go otherwise i hav to clear this case . This incident happened 6 months before . Is their any online facility to check my status ?
In a shop ... any shop ! I 've seen it in big supermarkets and corner bakalas
Almost all the supermarkets have it .
hi , you can get that rose water in any shop , yiu can get in Almeera , or in indian supermarket .

it is available in any leading supermarkets ... ask their staff so u wo n't get tired looking around .
For a moderate family it should be Okay salary , You will get fully furnished 2 B/R apartment for around 4250 QR -LRB- EZDAN VILLAGE -RRB- , then for your monthly household expenditure will be around 3000QR , then car 1500QR so total of around 9000QR , after that also u can save around 5000QR . if u can also work as there are plenty of opportunity it is additional to your savings . so thats it , welcome to Doha and enjoy the life in Doha
Its a fine package .
it is enough to lead a decent living minus savings . . !
Hello friend , WELCOME TO QATAR ... It would be a decent salary but yes with a minimal saving . . So would recommend both of u to work to have a proper saving for ur future . . U too will get the job . . Do n't worry . . Pack ur bags and just land here safely ... HAPPY JOURNEY ...
Yes , it will be okay for you , if you live simple life .
I think it 's good salary to live comfortably without being lavish.If you work too , it 'll be an extra benefit.You can have a good job according to your experience.Welcome to Qatar . It 's a nice , peaceful and comfortable place to live in .
Hi , would like to thank everybody for their response .
I agree with Mandi . It is applicable only for online purchases .
thanks guys ! have a good day . . ^ ^ , and oh , i just called their office and the staff told me that too -LRB- as per mandi and cherukkan -RRB- :-RRB-
Thanks for the info . I guess the `` in office '' purchase serves the identification purpose .
Confirm with the airline . There is a form your friend should fill in at the travel agent or local airline agent . You will need to travel with this form .
Only applies to on-line purchases .

Internet is fine , unlimited and able to cope with streaming no problem . Expensive though especially compared to UK . Satellite here is pretty rubbish both in quality and choice . Hopefully some Ozzies can confirm but certainly have seen NZ rugby on one of the channels .
You can get Fox Sports here on the OSN satellite network . Try looking on the listings www.osnetwork.com to see if they are carrying the games you want -LRB- hopefully they 're not time delayed -RRB-
OSN shows live NRL , plus AFL and most rugby so its a pretty good sports package if you are from down under . Currently they are showing the Ashes LIVE which is great .

Are you mad to even think this ?? Kids below 10yr old are not allowed to sit infront of the car seat ... Please do n't put the little one 's life in danger . . Yes , penalty is there . .
Think the penalty is QR 500 minimum . Dont take a chance .
Unfortunately , although it is against the law , it is RARELY enforced . However , what kind of person wants to know if there is a penalty for risking their child 's life ?
Only a damn stupid person can ask such a question .
yes there is penalty of 800 QR
No you can not enter , but you can avail the services of Al Maha meet and greet services who can do that all for you .
Al Maha is good , however you need to provide them with the details at least 48 hours before their arrival time and i think its about 600qr for 2 ppl but im not sure . just call qatar airways and ask the exact details .
No way , you cant get in . ask them to call a worker staniding infornt of the luggage belt . it 's a matter of 25 QR .
Not possible and i belive no need jut pass all information to them .
There is a Marhaba service who can assist them with immigration and baggage . You ca n't .
Marycatherine , Perhaps , you meant Al Maha services . . Consider going to the Al Maha counter for a hassle free service . Give your families flight iterinary to the Al Maha agent inside the arrival terminal and pay a small fee for their services . Once your family arrives at the arrival terminal , ask them to proceed to the Al Maha outlet BEFORE the immigration counter to their left . . Tell them to announce to the Al Maha representative about their names . They will be asked to wait in the spacious and comfortable lounge . An Al Maha rep will collect their passports and visas and clear their immigration for them and then come back to collect your family in 10 minutes . Your family will be lead through the immigration counter to the baggage pickup area counter where they can identify their luggages . They will direct someone to load the luggages onto a trolley and walk out near the public area where you can identify them Cheers

pls be specific , bonus for cabin crews or for cabin crows ?
coxtown ... where did you get cabin crows ? What and where is specific eh ?
Ask for bonus first then salary from Qatar Airways .
so they are getting good amount or just the basic only
I am looking for cabin crews in qatar as well . . please let me know if u find some : p
thanx actually I passed both qr and ek and still and do n't know which one to go for i want to know the salary they get in qr as a max as ek get up t 9000 but poor bonus so that is why i would like to know more about the qr salary as a min and max and the bonus as I heard they can get up to 20000 per year i am really lost do not know what to do
i think that the accomodation is provided for ladies so the 12k will be reduced to 8 or 9 right and for the bonus so it is just 3500k 1to 3 times only ??? / / / / / ?????
If you can survive pressure for 18 months till bonus , go for QA . If you wish to have better growth and peace of mind - join EK . Choice is yours .
<p> Qatar Airways is the numero uno airline in the world as of today . Your decision should be based on that and not the bonus that you 're hoping to make :--LRB- </p> <p> Do n't run after money , excel in your job and let money run after you ;--RRB- </p>

one year visit visa ????? what is this ? somebody give u wrong information . i think this is a residence visa if visa printed as - ENTRY PURPOSE-FAMILY VIS & expiry date one year from birth date me and my wife are under different sponsor i have one year old baby and my daughters visa printed as family visit we visit india two times last year
i think you 're having a wrong picture in your mind . if your baby is born in qatar , he/she will NOT be issued with VISIT VISA . visit visa is issued only to a person outside qatar and for the purpose of visiting . if you have done the birth certificate and have signed the documents at CID -LRB- due to 2 sponsers for you and your wife -RRB- , your baby is issued with the RP . I think it 's better you show your babys RP -LRB- or visa as you say -RRB- to somebody who can read arabic and get confirmed .
Something not right here ... My husband and I are with different sponsors . Our baby was born a few months back , and was issued a family visa . Quite straightforward . The only extra step is u 'll need to go to the CID office and show them ur papers . Once the baby gets his passport , u 'll need to go back there with a copy of the passport . -LRB- No idea why though -RRB-

Dude , do n't say you paid -LRB- your debt -RRB- some ruthless intermediates to get this job ?
Hit up Al Shamal road and start counting your distance from Landmark Shopping mall . Keep heading North on Al Shamal road -LRB- NOT Al Khor Road which takes you straight to Al Khor and passes the Lusail Intl. . Circuit on your left -RRB- for about 75.55 km You will come to an interchange -LRB- still under construction -RRB- with a small blue sign BEFORE the bridge reading -LSB- Al Fuwairit > -RSB- You will want to take the dirt road with that sign and keep driving down a very bumpy road until you hit the fishing village . To get to the beach , take a left before the village and follow the unpaved roads to the beach . Got a GPS ? Also , would n't recommend going there without a 4x4 , some spots have nasty soft sand . Check it out on Google Earth before you go . Feel free to PM . Good luck !
head northwest to al shamal road . landmark set KM to `` 0 '' after 77kms turn right . after 3.9 kms turn left for 450meters . youl be in the area .
whaiQL 's blog is really nice , with pictures too . You turn left just before you enter the village , the road looks like the 5th picture from the top in whaiQL 's blog . Trees on either side and a wooden barricade . Again , to the 4x4 issue , some spots do have soft sand . You can probably find a way through on hard ground though . It 's not an unpopular beach , so if you do get stuck , there should be someone around to dig you out , especially on the weekends .

I am just guessing all - IS WEST BAY the most porsh - expensive area in Doha ?
West Bay is like the Showcase of Qatar ... Basically just a showpiece of the Richeness in Doha , its got to do with high rise towers and Diplomatic area and the Commercial Districts ... nothing hi-fi about it ! But so to speak ... a normal F/F Studio would surely cost about 5K mate ... nothing less ... So get prepared actually ... !!!

Solution is to restart the computer : -RRB-
you deleted or some of your file is corrupted
Try System Restore ... It may help , other wise run the Recovery CD ...
just ignore it.if nothing happen , restore , reboot , reformat or reinstall .
Without getting papers from your company it is not possible , your company has to give papers to you then only possible , otherwise , you can approach any hotels visa or qatar airways visa , which is bit costly , but there you dont require company papers .
Yes there are travel agency can help you to obtain a tourist and business visa but if your question is if possible for you to have them a family visit visa i think its not possible because you need an NOC from your company that allowing you to sponsor your family for a visit.Goodluck
absolutely ca n't without your company permission .
my dear no way
you need a letter of no objection from your company if you want to get your family here on visit visa .
arrange a job first . or go on a visit visa and search for a job .
ohh okai ... so i can just immigrate there too rite ?
Why would you want to ? p.s. . We need more tax payers !!! See link below : http://qatar.usembassy.gov/iv.html
so what are going to be a taxi driver or you going to buy your own saven eleaven ...
all the best . if u have wasta , it will be much easier , but without wasta , u need to pray and pray !!!!! .
the best way to get a good job for urself is to search for a one .
my dear i am here from my childhood and i am educated and i have lot of nowledge but without wasta nothing is impossiple and if u are pakistani then even your own pakistani brothers do not help you pray and pray this is solution i my self pray for u but you dont depend on wasta carry on God will help you

ca n't wait for 30th ... '' . . and the beat goes on . . ''
THANK YOU !!!! Master_Jay !!! I guess I was n't looking hard enough ! Tiesto ! Wow - he 's actually a pretty big name ! How often do we get big-name DJ 's like Tiesto here in Doha ? I 'm definitely in for the Tiesto show !!! Anyone else on the board go to these events ? Please - if you find any more upcoming shows - please post ! EDIT : I do n't see Doha listed on Tiesto 's website :--LRB- - R
Tiesto 's site will be updated soon , do n't worry about that , its confirmed . Join my group on facebook , we have a lot more events coming featuring many big names . We had David Guetta in April . Other djs this year where Chuckie , stonebridge etc. . Try lava on thursdays , the last 2 hrs is mostly house and its usually rammed .
Wow ... Defected at the Hyatt looks delicious ! Really ??? David Guetta !?!? Did you go ? -LRB- I bet it was amazing ! -RRB- Thanks again for the info Master_Jay . I saw the events calendar updates that you added here on the site - awesome !!! - R
Jay . . what do u do apart from events ?
im a keen follower of house and trance . . from bangalore . . was an active social animal back in bangalore but haven found the right company yet in doha . . imnew to thid place so . . so guys plz keep me informed abt teh happenings n let me join u guys too . . if there are hardcore house music n trance followers here , we ll have a lot to talk in common . . Thanks everyone ! anything else big happening apart from Tiesto and sep 17th bash ??
Jay which ir ur group on facebook ??
Master_Jay - do you DJ at clubs , just for fun . . ??? What style do you like to spin ? I 'm not sure who all might read this thread or topic - but these shows should be a great time . The music and atmosphere will be great - and you can be sure the environment will break down language and cultural barriers . Did anyone here go to David Guetta in April ? Just wondering how the show went - how was the crowd ... did anyone get rooms for after-parties ?
Hey cnadnaan ... I 'm not a `` hardcore '' follower of the music ... but I really enjoy Trance and House , and tend to listen to it most of the time while driving , etc. . I actually like Tiesto 's older offerings a little better than his latest production . I think I burned up Nyana in my CD player a few years ago ... :--RRB- I went to the Pearl Lounge I think on a Thursday - and there was a really good DJ there not too long ago - ca n't remember his name . He played a great mix of music , some house , some Hip-Hop , some Arabic - a little bit of everything - and kept the crowd moving really well . I think I like that better than anything else - a DJ that can read the crowd - and feel what they are reacting to . My favorite DJ is probably Sasha ... I really like Markus Schulz too .
if ur big fan of house or EDM ... place to be is crystal lounge . . Its in W hotel ... dey bring amazing guest dj 's . .
Free course ?
Hey Dinesh , Check this thread for contact details I can suggest you http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1698427 If you want them free you can consider subscribing to our blog where we frequently post most viewed Photography tips and tutorials found on the web . Link : http://blog.djustified.com/ I would love to teach anyone who is willing to learn photography but My free time is very limited due to my job timings , so I prefer helping others learn Photography and master their skills through my blog . .
its very helpful my friend.thank you.i also have very limited free time because of my job .
I dont know about Free but i think Timebandit knows a thing or two about photography ... where is TB
There is a user called MRST . he gives courses but surely not for FREE ... he has an ad i think in the classifieds ...
Try to JOIN WARP -LRB- Web Alliance of Radical Photographers -RRB- It 's a group of photographers . Members of that group is learning photography through collaboration . You just have to ask question and they will answer you . They are conducting seminars but it has contribution that they will pay for the place and the foods .
well , its not photography course but a collaboration of photographers either newby or expert in the field of photography .

Mashallah is also said when you see something beautiful . Likeif someone has a beautiful car or baby , you say Mashallah so that it will wart off the evil eye . Aisha-Taweela
Mashallah is like the fruit of insha allah , it means `` God has willed it '' . for example when you wish to have a baby you say insha allah , when your baby comes to world you say masha allah . <i> Poverty is not for the sake of hardship . No , it is there because nothing exists but God . Poverty unlocks the door -- what a blessed key ! </i> - Jalaluddin al-Rumi

i thought mashallah is something like `` awesome '' . . they use it when they want to express the admiration , no ? for example , when i wore my new abaya , all qatari gals at the office said : `` wow ! mash ` allah !

UK Eng Qatar . . FYI 1 . In a Allh -LRB- -RRB- is an Arabic term evoked by Arabic , Persian , Turkish , Urdu and Bengali speakers to indicate hope for an aforementioned event to occur in the future . The phrase translates into English as `` God willing '' or `` If it is God 's will '' , sometimes spoken as DV , the Latin abbreviation for Deo volente or simply `` hopefully '' . 2 . Usage of Insha'Allah derives from Islamic scripture , Surat Al Kahf -LRB- 18 -RRB- :24 : `` And never say of anything , ' I shall do such and such thing tomorrow . Except -LRB- with the saying -RRB- : ` If God wills ! ' And remember your lord when you forget ... '' And religion is the first and foremeost part of Muslims , and our all affairs are controlled by teachings under Islam ... so where ever a true Muslim is ... spirit of Islam is there . Let me know if you need further clarifications . Think like a man of Action ... ... act like a man of Thoughts !!!!

yes , according to my experience you just need the passport copy the NOC , the eye test , the copy of dubai DL and 250 QAR , they simply give you the license . he whole process takes one hour only . you must have a credit card to pay they do not take cash .
You can change it in Qatar without any test . go to nearby driving school and ask for the procedure .
The will change it for you in Qatar , not test is required .
Ooh wait , if your family is going to send them on through regular post , it could sometimes take months for your books to get here . My advice is to find a mail forwarding service in the UK . We have one in the US . I order from anywhere , they send the order to my PO BOX in Florida , then the mail forwarding service sends it through DHL and it gets delivered to my husband 's office here . It is kind of expensive , but our items get here in 3 to 4 days from leaving Florida . Motherhood ... The hardest job you 'll ever love ! : -RRB-
use ARAMEX Shop and Ship service when ordering from Amazon . For more information Check out www.aramex.com
arrive no problem i order thru amazon.co.uk and sometimes despite postage it works out cheaper than here .
Definitely Aramex - am also a big reader and rely heavily on my beloved Amazon ... so I order from Amazon.co.uk to my UK aramex address and 3/4 days later it is here in Doha . MUCH quicker than qatari post . Really is the most reliable option . Aramex charge QR39 for first 0.5 kg and then QR31 for every 0.5 kg after .
I use Aramex a lot , ordering stuff online especially in Amazon both UK and US ... I love reading a lot too and I buy in Amazon almost every month . . Aramex is way to go ...
Amazon.co.uk to a Qatar PO Box works for us .
Try Iqra Trading Company . They are one of the biggest book importers in the country and supply most of Qatar 's schools . As a trading company they are little known to the general public but their prices are good and the service is excellent . Call 451 4092
can you oder for me anything i will pay for it.from amazon.co.uk.call me on 7328213 .
I had some stuff delivered by DHL . Well when I say delivered , I mean to their depot where I had to go to get it . Bloody expensive too .

there is a product called dermatix it is used by most surgeons and dermatologist it is very god for new scars
owen . . you made me laugh and cry at the same time . . Chicken pox ?? . . is n't it a kids ' illness , particularly those under age 12 ? poor thing . . i am really sorry to hear it . . :-LRB- here are some advices : Get Rid of Chickenpox Scars Step1 Talk to a dermatologist . Have your skin and scars evaluated by a professional before you try any products or home remedies . A dermatologist will have many different options for you to consider . Step2 Apply sandalwood oil and Vitamin-E onto your skin . If you scars are not as deep or old , you can rub some sandalwood oil Vitamin-E based products onto your scars . Do this consistently for a few months until the scars have healed . Step3 Try laser treatment . If the scars are old or very deep , creams and lotions will most likely not work . You might have to consider removing these types of scars with an intense laser treatment at your dermatologist 's office . Step4 Consider excision by your dermatologist or doctor . Excision is the removal of scars by cutting them off and stitching the skin closed . This option is especially suitable for deep scarring . You will still have some scarring , but it will be much less noticeable than the chickenpox scars . Step5 Get a Microdermabrasion treatment . Microdermabrasion is a deep facial peel that removes a very fine layer of skin . This process will remove scars from on the surface of your skin . Get this process done at a clinic or certified spa for best results . Good luck sweetie . . :-RRB- <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed .

I feel for you honey ... had the chicken pox when I was 25 years old and 3 months pregnant with my first child . -LRB- remind me to thank my mom again for keeping me `` safe '' from all those other kids with the pox , when I was little !! -RRB- Do what QS said ... and I was going to say Vitamin E capsules work wonders for scars . Just get the capsules from GNC , puncture one end of the capsule and apply . . rub it in throughly ... keep OUT of the sun for at least 6 months -LRB- or use really strong sunscreen -RRB- tho as new skin , such as scars , will tan differently than other skin ... Grant me the senility to forget the people I never liked , the good fortune to run into the ones I do , and the eyesight to tell the difference .
when my scars were new , i used Olay white cream and it was enough for me , at least for my face . i had about 5 scars on my face , but they all went away after a while -LRB- applied twice a day -RRB- . but it 's always better to see your dermatologist .
try CONTRACTUBEX . . but im not sure if u can it is in here . . that is one brand name of scar removing cream in the phil .

do to help you until you heal up ? If you are still itchy . . try pulverizing dry oatmeal and putting it in a tub of lukewarm water and sitting until you ca n't stand the cold anymore ... helps you from wanting to scratch yourself to death . Grant me the senility to forget the people I never liked , the good fortune to run into the ones I do , and the eyesight to tell the difference .
if you can get ano nighttime antihistamines that should help with the itching also . . Valtrex is an antiviral med ... and although the chickenpox is viral , it wo n't really help with the itching . You will also be contagious until the very LAST pox has dried up and fallen off ... so take your time and get well !!! Grant me the senility to forget the people I never liked , the good fortune to run into the ones I do , and the eyesight to tell the difference .

Do n't scratch them , let them heal and dry naturally . oTHER WISE THEY WILL MARK YOU FOR EVER . Use Cortisone with aloe vera to kill the itch and promote the healing faster . keep taking your medications completely . Take the advise , from a person who had some real bad chicken pox at the age of 35 .

Its really tough to get a part time job in qatar . i guess you better enjoy ur vacation
teach ur favourite subjects / crafts for small children . u can enjoy as well as earn money .
VOLUNTEER ! , You said you do n't want to be bored , you did n't say anything about wanting to be paid for your time ! There are lots of organizations that would accept your help .
Before going to the traffic dept. make sure you have NOC letter from sponsor plus the application form .
Yes . You can change your license very easily . Go to the traffic department .
NO , NO , Having an american Drivers license will not get you a Qatari License . DO a Search on QL and you will see that this was changed 2-3 months ago for americans .
yep you can change it ... no problem
Unfortunately they are not converting American driver license anymore . If you go to a driving school , they will give you a date to test . The test has 4 parts , traffic signals , L parking , Pocket parking , and street driving . I did n't pass the L parking and I have another chance to test :-LRB- Good Luck to you !
No way from G.C.C only do not waist your time
Hardest is '' L '' Parking . Find a friend who has a manual car . Practice with it . Hated the instructors .
You sky box will not work , you are outside the satellite footprint . My TV is multi system so I do n't have a problem here . <aÂ href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/2847916040/Â title=_MG_9382Â byÂ baldrick2dogs,Â onÂ Flickr> <imgÂ src=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3215/2847916040_826cbe2aa0_m.jpgÂ width=240Â height=119Â alt=_MG_9382Â /> Did you Google it first ?
Didnt think it would but if I didnt ask I 'd not know ... hey ! sorry for being an idiot what do you mean by multisystem ? We have a Toshiba ... think it 's a Rega or something WLT 32 ... it 's got built in free view etc. . Do you think that would work over there ... or anyway we could find out ? Thanks !
Just throw the old one & buy a new one when you come here . Why so Greedy ? Ban Spoon Feeding not Me
Sentiment ! We came with backpacks to this country and nothing else ... besides it being scarry doing that again and this time with three kids entow , we had to work hard for our bits and feel a bit sad to get rid of them . But seems thats the way to go ... Any online shopping sites we can visit to get ideas ?
Qatar is PAL B/G . UK is PAL I. . . It wo n't work . Sky wo n't work either . Just get a TV here , they 're cheap and multisystem -LRB- Would work in the UK -RRB- :-RRB-

Bring your original passport + OEC copy issued by KSA .
Make sure that OEC is available before paying . I find out that POEA records are not centralized . I once paid my POEA dues at POLO-Qatar -LRB- but that time , No OEC available -RRB- . I had presented my payment receipt to POEA Regional Office -LRB- Philippines -RRB- and after quick verification , I had to pay again in order to obtain OEC because it was not posted in their system .
it depends upon u and client . u can conduct any place which suites according the buisness environment .
At any place you want . .
If your client need open air then conduct it in cornich . . otherwise invite them at your home for dinner and do meeting ... : D
there is one company in one tower at al cournish , they have smart offices so you can make your meeting . . contact me to give you all details
Nothings gona happen if the cars are parked under the sun . They usually do n't last that in that lot either . Anyways , my suggestion would be to avoid buying LC from used car showrooms . Most of them are hit somewhere or raped in sealine . Just make sure you take your car for vehicle inspection on Salwa Road even if your buying from Toyota .
dont by it from a local youth
do n't buy LC 's used by Qataris
@VANMOST ... What about the prices offered by those used car showrooms?Could you share it here?I am also looking for a pre owned one ... ...
Yup , I am concerned about the owners indeed but hard to find them out if you are buying from Show rooms . Toyota is offering 135 - 145 for 2009 models .
do your search @ QL ... . answered too many times already ... BTW ... its do work fine here ...
Yes you can use it here ...
Yes u can I use it to speak 2 family in uk Sometimes it is n't clear but it works
no Doubt , U CAN
Macmoss , as long as you use it for personal use it is allowed . But if you intend to use to sell somebody else the servcice you could be having trouble with authorities . Either you call to a mobile or landline outside Qatar it works fine . Also remember skype-to-skype calls are free . Best of luck ... welcome !!!!
yes it works here , but it s not very good quality , because of the network connection that is not very good !!
GO to Hamad Woman Hospital in Hamad Medical Centre ... if u have Hamad Health Card it would be an advantage , but if u dont all u can do just bring ur copy passport and married certificate -LRB- this one is required -RRB- . it has very low cost for such a very good service of hospitality and doctors -LRB- obstetric & Gynecology -RRB- . I was giving birth there 3 moths a go ... very good hospital ;-RRB- ... good luck
it depends on the Hospital , CS or normal , about 10,000 to 20,000 i think .
Go to Hamad Women 's Hospital , bring all your necessary documents . My wife give birth there a couple of years ago . I only paid 200 QR for the room + around 35 QR for medicine and vitamins . Great service too .
In Hamad Hospital you will be best service in the world and they charge only 200 Riyal maximum that is room charges only . In Al-Ahli it will be about 15,000 to 20,000 , -LRB- My friend 's wife delivered there and they paid this amount -RRB-
No Need of Exit Permit for your father since he is on family visit .
How about doing some research and some reading http://dubai.ae/en/Lists/Topics/DispForm.aspx?ID=16&category=Visitors In the end the Embassy or Consular service could provide you with some more details . Even ETIHAD or EMIRATES airline offices could be useful in this kind of queries . Regards !!
On arrival visa is AED 185 but not for all -LRB- certain categories like Engineers , Doctors , Managers , Teachers , Accountant who has got the designation printed on their QID -RRB- You can get the visa through the Airlines and the cost will be Qr . 350 if I am not mistaken .
yes sir , it is required .
I total agree you need a return ticket .
yes ...
yes mandatory to have a return ticket
compulsary return ticket needed thanks
Its compulsary
It depends.However if you are there with traveller you can say that you gon na renew that before it ends . . This helps me and no problems while my family from india .
returned ticket is required to show them at the time of visa reception . which should be attached to the documents you submit to them .

only clairvoyance . lol .
paul . would you be surprised if i tell you that you are thinking of one particular food this morning .
oh yes , i did because im hungry .
now what would really surprise me if you can guess what food i ate this breakfast .
i am going to ask you that question , are you a man ? why you are very unsecured about my forum topic ?
tnk whyteknight , that is a good answer . it means you understand my topic . no need for you to go to Mandaluyong City -LRB- inside -RRB- . only the unsecured doham needs .
we shouldnt refute the existence of things we dont see or understand . . will power , ESP , distant healing , hypnotism , telepathy , planchet etc. are not anybody 's creation . there are literatures covered in many books dealing in meta-physics . these occult sciences do exist and some day we will learn more about them .
MATET nice ENGLISH ... hahaha . . `` unsecured '' what is this ? waaaaaaaaaaaa ... You need to see a primary school english teacher ... perhaps she can teach your ABCs again waaaaaaaaaaaaaa `` HIPOS DYAN !!! ''
where is your COMPREHENSION doham ? in the other thread you are supposed to hit your head with a hammer , how can you do that if your hands are not secured or UNSECURED . WHO NEEDS THE PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHER NOW ... ?
If you have a good ESP , let 's try it online with me . We can only try if you have a good ESP .
remember negative thoughts can destroy your ESP .
for me yes , mjamille .
lobot , your friends are telling you that you are a very fine gentleman .
paul , if i will try to put my thoughts into your mind , your mind should be ready to receive it . with negative thoughts , then it is not possible .
doh ! im getting stupid . sorry matet .
interesting thread . . well , i thought i had a bit of this extra sensory perception . . but this really has to be checked by matet . . tell me if i qualify ??
You know Matet What other meaning of ESP . It also feature into my Mercedes to give car more stability .
doham , your comment make sense only to person like you . why did the funny farm release you so soon ?
i do have PSP but not ESP `` lol
are you sensing my pain now ?
not yet , until i slap you in the face .

Go To Jarir Good Luck

Sorry this is the only one I know , ... Try to ask in Al Naser street in phone shops . . Sorry Good Luck
HTC does not have good after sale service in Qatar . Best guide is the internet .
NO ... he can not work unless he has a NOC or wait the 2-year ban . .
dont put yourself in a really complicated situation . no NOC or release is really not possible to work again in less than two year cancellation .
this could be complicated situation and depends . There is risk involved in this . but it could be possible
hey thanks ... what can be the complication ? . . the profile is techno commercial sales ... which will have nothing to do with the present company ...
please let me know what your future employer told you about business visa .
Only Filipino are allowed to work on BV !
even the company is UAE based but still he 'll be working in Qatar ... what 's the difference ? all workers here has an RP .
well dont blame QL if you get caught :-RRB- Then its bye to Qatar forever ...
no one has said any thing yet ... the things are still hypothetical . . certainly they will recruit one if the person has a NOC . . as the person will need to have NOC ... any one come here on business visa to meet the clients and return to the home country . .
if you 're trying to say is `` BUSINESS '' then its fine , you can go here just for a short time business visit . . either a training , short business trips , business meetings , etc. . . BUT your intension is to WORK ... you can go here and see for yourself ... just be ready !
i guess one can do it , some ppl are doing business same way

al-khebra - not because i got the license in first test but also for school 's environment and professionalism as compared to other schools . before taking admission there i had visited other schools as well . al-khebra is easily reachable as well . i was enrolled for full course -LRB- 40 days -RRB- but i passed in 20 days alhamdulillah -LRB- attended only 12 classes in practicle :-RRB- . my instructor was Randy -LRB- filipino -RRB- . hope it helps u

Al Khebra or Karwa both are good
Al Khebra is the best and ask for instructor larry he is a filipino and very good at his job .
I think clothes prices are higher in UK than here . . but it 's always wiser to buy clothes during Sale season as u can really get good deals during those times . .
It depends on the brand . As a general rule most UK brands -LRB- such as BHS , Next , M&S , H&M -RRB- are priced at an exchange rate of QR7 to 1 . As the current rate is closer to QR5 to 1 clothes will be cheaper in the UK . On top of this retailers are discounting heavily in the UK because of the recession . If you look at some French or Spanish brands -LRB- Zara -RRB- they are cheaper in Doha .
I agree that now the exchange rate is so low then clothes are deifnitely cheaper back in UK especially with the great sales that are on there at the moment . Unless you buy from a recognised brand here the quality is not very good , so my is advice take a holiday back in uk and fill your suitcase with all the bargains there !!
A pair of undies are costing Qr 45 here ...
Thanks , guys . That was really helpful . I am still in the UK . But soon will be moving.I am going to bring everything from here I guess . As the prices here are fantastic now like linen trousers at Next on sale are 8 -LRB- 44 Qrs -RRB- . So do n't think anything could beat that on price and quality .
yes u cud surely get a pair of jeans for 60QR ... but that was sooo 5 years ago !
um . i 'm sure clothing prices in uk is more expensive than in doha . 60-100 riyal jeans ? you could work on that . i 'm sure there 's a place where you can find a good deal . ; o -RRB-
Your employer should be helping you this , but you need to take your passport , 100QR -LRB- fees -RRB- , and the paper that was printed out from your sponsor . When you get there just ask where to sit and wait for your turn .

Try to make your medical test and a chest x-ray in Medical Commission in Abu Hamour -LRB- Mesaimeer area -RRB- , take your passport , visa and 2 photos . Results will be over after 3 days , you can pick them up on the same place . Then go to any other clinic -LRB- lab -RRB- to make or confirm blood group , it is over after few minutes . The last thing is to go to electronic fingerprinting-Mesaimeer Services Centre . They will inform you when you should come again and they will print your visa in passport and you will get ID .

If you are talking about the <b> outside </b> of a pot , rub a bar of soap all over the outside . My husband is an avid outdoorsman & backpacker and this is the method he uses when cooking over an open fire ... always works .
keep the flame to low or if you want fast cooking , apply claymud at the bottem of vessels.this way you can avoid !!

3,000 QR to 12,000 QR depending on Experience .

it 's barely above what a housemaid would make .

WELCOME TO QATAR , ****** & ************* QATAR LIVING ,
wallah , FS . . `` troll season '' . . it looks like they multiply in heat . :-RRB- and it is some particular kind of trolls , all sound the same ... all of them have only 3 brain cell . One is focused on her own beauty -LRB- narcissism -RRB- . Another is responsible for man hunting . And third - unstable and psychopathic - is a centre of lack of confidence , which is expressed in the maniacal obsession that everyone hates her ... what a contradictive psycho case ... it looks like an epidemic among trolls , I hope not contagious though , and will stay in their community only ... <i> <b> ********************* `` What lies behind us and what lies before us are small compared to what lies within us .

yes , there is entrance fee 5 riyal/head ... its nice but singapore zoo is the best ...
If I remember correctly it is about QR7 per adult . Children for free . Fridays are family days.It is a regular Zoo with regular animals in it . Not modern type nor a big one , but great for Kids to experience . Mine love to go every time . I have had a lot of fun riding the Quad Bikes in the Dunes behind Sealine beach resort if you like that type of outing ... .
Thanks guys . . i appreciate ur kind replies.Plz Suggest me some good place to visit also .
dirt cheap , QR5/adult , QR2/child , disabled people free .
QR5 entrance fee ... Hint : Ducks are even kept for the show ...
Try any of the promotional gift shops .

YOU CAN FIND THOSE CUPS IN SOUQ WAQIF ...
YOU CAN FIND THOSE CUPS IN SOUQ WAQIF ...
Where in Souq Waqif can I find them ?
Technically there 's nothing to stop you , but people have been accosted by unhappy locals and the police have been called on some occasions . Better to find a baron patch of land somewhere . It 's not likd there are n't plenty of areas like that around !
DOGS AND WORKERS FROM INDUSTRIEL AND SINGLE PEOPLE ARE ONLY ONE NOT ALLOWED IN CORNICHE
No dogs are not allowed . Its simple any thing which can disturb others are not alowed .
check in Big Malls ...
Please tell me once you 've found one and where , preferably portable .
Sports shop
Villagio mall ! the sports store next to fast food area , i bought mine there :-RRB- -RRB-

I make more than that and I am not a Treasury Specialist :--RRB- -RRB- ROFL !!!!
My CEO earns hell no . of times than HIM . He is also not a treasury analyst right ? . What if you are in a bigger position than him ? : -RRB-
I see , do you have a full expat package ?
I 've noticed a lot of people mentioning their salary on Qatarliving . ~ * Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret * ~
I know a bunch of guys in one of the Multinational Banks in treasury who make more than that and this was two years ago ... Having said that , I am no expert on finance ... All I know is that these were guys with about 10 to 15 years work ex like Lorenteggio ...
If its one of the national banks , the offer would be less than that of some of the multinational financial institutions ... ` some ' ... not all ...
Lorenteggio , it is alright . You are not the first person to do so . But its just the way people could ask . Maybe something like , how much would suffice for a good life in Qatar . People on Qatarliving vary in status and the salaries vary as well . People earn QR2000 to QR 150000 a month . So , it might hurt people to know that others are making what they would save in 350 years . Just my opinion . I wish you a happy stay in Qatar once you arrive . ~ * Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret * ~
check the Groups tab . and oh , no need to mention your salary :--RRB- usapa na ...
Thanks , I 've already look there and unfortunately there is n't an italian one . I mentioned the salary just to understand if it 's reasonable or not Diego
Whats YOUR position ? I mean job prof ?
Treasury Specialist
YOU serious ? : #
We are both new to the forum so it is Ok . We will learn from each other . Welcome to Qatar in advance and I am sure you will have a pleasant time . ~ * Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret * ~
Not yet decided , we will see
There is a thriving community ... with a very active embassy . But why do you Italian guys keep switching-off the Aircon and opening the windows ? ... lol
Ciao Lorenteggio i 'm not in finance so could n'tcomment how that offer compares with the local rate , but I would say that you have to judge how much better of you 'll be than at home . Cost of living is definitely higher than in italy , but depends a lot if you have accomodation included . you 're going to pay at least QAR14 ,000 per month for somewhere OK to live . If it 's only a little above average salary at home then I 'd say it is n't going to make you a lot better off , but this depends on your tax situation . Not sure how the italian tax works , but no tax payable here . You have to bear in mind that while Qatar is very safe and you can buy most things here -LRB- prosciuto excepted ! -RRB- , it 's not the most comfortable or exciting place to live . so you 'll end up spending a lot on flights and holidays to stay sane . Good luck FG
Thank for the comment ; as far as I 've seen cost of living is higher here in Europe than in Qatar thanks to the strong EUR
Lorenteggio , se ti capita anche solo di venire qui qualche gg giusto per farti un idea di cosa sia vivere in Qatar -LRB- io ci sto da + di 1 anno -RRB- mandami un msg in privato e ci mettiamo in comunicazione . Saluti Mauro PS : e ' un OTTIMO salario se hai full expact benefits !!!
he looks really funny
sorry , italian like looking , but do Italians have good courage , OMG , i do n't have , my black and bald BIL scares me , he looks like an animal
Thank you ,
go to Xerox on Salwa road . got good machines
If you are not specific on laser printers , try Epson photo printers and you can get them from Computer Arabia S/Room near the midmac roundabout area ...
I looked around at a lot of places a few months ago for A3 printer , and Jarir and PC One only had one , the same one , but needed a good quality one , I managed to find an Epson one in Office 1 , was bit pricey but its good as it 's being used often .
Epson at pc one salwa road
thanks alot guys . . Can u tell me the prices of the mentioned printers above ?
A4 SIZE COLOUR PRINTER COSTING QR1100 / - ONWARDS AND A3 SIZE QR14000 / - APROX.BASED ON YOUR REQUIREMENT ONLY I CAN SUGGEST ONE ie DAILY USAGE FOR WHAT PURPOSE etc.OTHERWISE IF IT IS A SINGLETIME USAGE YOU CAN GET IT ON RENTAL BASIS
According to your budget , AALISHAN is the best in Muntaza area ...
Bukhara located in the Khalifa Tennis court compound is a good one . If you want to attempt on weekends try to book your seats . Good variety of vegetarian and Non-vegetarian range of Indian food . try out - Cheers
No other doubts - Vasantha Bhavan - Bharat restaurant is the best . Will fit your budget too .

electronic what ? O_O time to do some research .
I have been doing it for four days havent touched a cigarette
CHECK THIS SITE BY ENGLISH http://www.qatarliving.com/node/2863776 AND THIS BY ARABIC http://www.qatarliving.com/node/2863774 BEST REGARDS
just fantastic
Yeah im try it as well , its really goood :-RRB-
I 'd suggest you try both .
wow looks very costly get the Imei number from the box of each cell phone that it to capital police and they will do their work
i agree with first answer to report both
mmm . . lost world dude
there is option in IPHONE 4 to trace your lost mobile and you can view it in MAP that where is located , i fond my one in Philippians , lol , haha , but i got my one through that ,
Well here is the thing , It depends upon the system in place . If they want they can trace the mobile phone with approximate location . there is an IMEI of each mobile mobile . And when ever a mobile phone get registered to the network or makes a phone call or sends SMS , there is an entry recorded in database with SIM number + IMEI number . So if someone is using your friend 's mobile phone , they definitely have the record of it . And they can trace the guy as well . the best way is to goto Police and report it .
Do not worry . Go to police station and they will register your complain and through your IMIE no they will trace your the lost phone even your cell is off even he remove your sim card . Through IMEI police will trace the guy as well .
Corr ; He has typed in the correct name in the subject `` Voda Fone '' . It may be a typo mistake in the text . It is a global company and statring opearations from Mar 09 . their Phone numbers will start from digit 7 .
It seems as the guy mis spelt the name , the correct name is Voda Fone . Actualy , Voda Fone Sims are not available now for purchase , till the Month of March in Villagio . Best of Luck
Not yet available in the market ; however , soon it will be as yesterday they start the marketing / promotion in Villagio at around 7:30 pm . That was FUN !! Cheers . .
Adopt a cat or kitten from QAWS . He or she will be healthy and you will have given a home to a homeless animal . What better spirit for Eid or Christmas ?
sorry about that ... i answered the wrong question : -RRB-
you can get these in march and not before they 'll probably began in villagio or citycentre
At the end of meeting he said ok , you can check after 2 days . That 's what all he said .
just keep trying . if they ignored ur papers resubmit again , that 's what happen to me ,
The waiter in my favorite restaurant is called ` captain ' ... is he the same captain you 're talking to ? If he 's the guy , I can tip him to accept your request !!
SalemSAJ We also have so called captain in plane , cruise ships and in the force . Do you know these captain 's as well ?
pls send me message ... we had the same problem . . thanks
thank you all for the information
Palm Island Is the tiny island in the middle of Doha bay that you can see from the corniche . It used to have a small amusement park on it and 2 restaurants . They were demolished -LRB- old and rundown -RRB- for the Asian games and a beautiful water fountain was to take it 's place . Unfortunately as of right now all that is there is sand .
Palm Island is history now . It is a small Island off Corniche near Statue of Oryx , all the date palm trees are reloaceted to different parts of Doha .
Palm island is at cornich and now that may be called as barren island because all the palm tree removed before Asian games.you can have a close look while getting into a boat near the bida park
no need even if you are coming from your country , you need it only once you decide to extend it for another period of time but i know that visit visa is good only for 30 days max unlike business visa which can be extended until 6 months .
Medical test is necessary if you decided to extend your stay after 30 days .
none
where did u get this info . ?
go to Magrabi center beside Al Ahli Hospital . They have lot of patients and having operations from 3 to 10 patients almost everyday .
Please do not use ` cheap ' and ` best ' in the same sentence .
I will vote for Dr.Moopen in Al Rafa clinic but sorry I donnt know his fee as I always use my Insurance card in hospitals , but donnt go to Al-Magrabi as to expensive almost 300 Qr/visit & u have to wait almost half an hour to see a doctor even u have an appointment.Good luck .
yeah ... `` you pay peanuts , you get monkeys '' as the saying goes . i agree al rafa would be a your `` best '' bet .
The Grand Masjid near your location Masjid , Abdul Rahman Zaman has a markaz e tahfeez called Markaz Al Imam Ad Do ` ree , the operate after Al Asr to Majrib . Lots of teachers and lots of kids , your kid will love the environment and will also get to know more of the community ... You may please go there and check your self and perhaps they have transport as well . All is free . . The teachers are on job Muadins of locality Msajids and come from different language back ground ... etc. . Hope this helps !!!
<!--break--> Greatly appreciate this , thank you , this is excellent news . I will check it out today inshallah . I guess this is only for boys , I am looking a teacher who can preferably come home to teach both my son and daughter .
The printed form is equally good . Do n't worry .
no problem , , , , if u wan na be more sure take it to any visa officer , he will satisfy u
You shd be ok . Same thing happened to me as well . Just check it online with the visa number .
there should be small white sticker attached in your passport that has the date of entry to Doha and the expiry date -LRB- or your visa extention date -RRB- . so that incase police checks the validity of your stay in Doha , it will be easier . better visit immigration office in madinat khalifa to validate the authenticity for your own safety .
they dnt stick the sticker anymore , they will only give u printed form mentioning the expiry date ,
Yes , stickers are out of order . Make sure to keep safely the printed paper :-RRB-
Guys , Can we extended family Visit visa beyond 6 months ?? Please advice , Permanent visa is under process .
visit visa can extend 1 more month after the 6th month . but you need to show a plane ticket that on the expiry you will leave qatar .

i am not married , but i have seen my cousins mom and dad forced out of facebook by their own children , which is really sad ...
I 'm a friend of both of my children on facebook , but usually I noticed children are unhappy to have their parents on facebook ...
are on FB
Why would a parent want to be a friend of a child on FB unless they are being nosy ?
I am not in that situation actually coz my baby is still small to do all these . . But i am sure she too will do the same once she will grow up . . hehehe . . Neither my father nor my mom are the member of any social networking site . . Though my siblings are there in my list but i have put them under the category of FAMILY -LRB- as bro or sis -RRB- . .
Well , it 's quite simple . . If you are hiding something from your parents , you wo n't be so happy to have them as friends in your fb . . If you are secret free , it 's not really a problem . .
soniya you are brown , stay away from FB , it is a white guy 's invention ...
Being a friend on facebook does n't mean at all that youre a friend of him as in real life ... actually It signifies that you have some connection with the person that 's it .
Good job ! hjasdhwqyi , Employ of the year !!!
Everyday , spammer with new ID keeps flooding QL . This is so annoying .
WK , i know u r no more on QL . . so i wo n't comment on ur post . .
Parents can get in any way ... with some other Id and you think its some stranger ... or some friend 's friend ! Is that too hard ?
I am sure that the children would be less open if they knew that their parents were linked to them on Facebook . .
Quite hard , Jack mohan . . : - -RRB-
jack , I think a parent that does that needs medical attention . And brit , its all about how you raise your children .
wats the use of making fake profile ... ???
lots of scrab garages located in the industrial area try street no : 18 if am not mistaken there is one Afghani man he import broken cars from japan and else where .

Thanks a lot guys , I got the answer
me and my girlfriend are often dating here in doha . . almost evryday . . for almost 2 yrs.i think it 's safe here , nothing to worry about .
Qatar is an Islam Country . To let you understand , try to have a date in Saudi Arabia with your girlfriend and if you would be lucky enough - you would see what I mean . Dating with your girlfriend here in the Middle East is unacceptable to Islam Tradition !!
Rule number 1 : Do not hold hands . Rule number 2 : Do not kiss . Rule number 3 : Do not hug for more than 3 seconds . Rule number 4 : Do not attempt fornication of any kind whatsoever -LRB- especially in public -RRB- . Rule number 5 : If any of the above rules are flouted , make sure you lock room , draw curtains and increase volume of the music to a substantial level .
Qatar is a very safe country , there is no problem here for dating but you have to keep in mind that this is an Islamic country and have to respect the laws of Qatar . Try not to get carried away in public ...
yes it is true mostly now a days b care ful
Its true . Be careful . Try not to jump on your date .
As long as you both dont go overboard with PDA no worries ... ... . .
Hi.This country has its own culture that we both expatriates and locals to be aware of , hence should be followed . You ca n't blame anybody once you got into these kinds of troubles . So better you always bear in mind that you are working and living in a country where traditional values are strictly being adapted and observed by the authorities . Good luck
you need to be careful even if you take your dad out for a drive , rules of traffic , otherwise you could endanger safety of the road .
Thanks for the reply
They will post a slip in your Post box saying that you received a parcel and to collect it from the counter .
Then you get a call from Qpost to come collect your parcel .
Thanks FS & DA . But which counter do I have to collect the parcel from ? Corniche or the Local QPost ?
where is your postbox located . there you will get it .
My Post Box is in Gharafa Woqod Petrol Station . But there is no counter there . Only the boxes in a glass room .
Any reasons for your answer ?
Qtel Vodafone is too hit and miss on reception for me .
As I thought . What are the prices like for phones there ? A decent phone , iPhone preferably ?
About the same as the UK -LRB- iPhone 4s QR 2999 = 518 -RRB- . All phones here are unlocked .
buy a factory unlocked iphone from there when you come ...
vodafone
Vodafone is the shyt !
definitely QTEL ... and yes they are
HIV Test in Qatar , confediantially , , please suggest

You should have your own lab with experience in lab tests . ha hahaaa `` Helping HANDS r better than praying LIPS ''
Go to Rumailla Hospitol and meet Dr. Abdul lattif or Sister Ameera . They will conduct the test . `` forum ... . . test conducted clinically , results declared confidentially with your sponsor and deport publicly ... '' Results will not be available to anybody -LRB- strictly Confidential -RRB- . You will not be deported but you will be treated with best medicine available in the world . Free of Charge . There was an article written by Dr. Lattif on Gulf Times sometime back on HIV issue in Qatar .
God forbid , if the result is + ve HIV/AIDS ; the patient will definitely get the best medicine in the WORLD and off course FREE but He/she is to sacrifice the JOB and leave the country being an expat , the treatmetn will be different with a LOCAL ! ... the real stories will never get published in the newspapers .
There are 2 senarios . If you detect possitive during your medical test for RP . You will be Deported . However , if you detect positive after obtaining RP you will not be deported but treated with best medicine available in the world . Free of Charge .

... No Objection Certificate . Aside from being used in the construction industry , it is also used in employment . If you want to transfer to another employer here , you need to ask you employer to give you an NOC . It is not a privilege , so you are at the mercy of your employer here -- if you wanted to resign , leave the country , or transfer to a new employer here .
Yea Joey pretty much summed it up except for the typo where I think he meant to say it is not a right it is a privilege .
i only know Open KFC
... even if you earned it , sometimes the employer will want you to beg for it , just to prove his `` power '' over you .
Yes , you can but weather to give you an NOC is at your employers discretion . .
NOC is at the discretion of your current employer !

u2 , no , no , NO ! You can not pay for a visa , it is illegal . And just to scare you , I knew a Nigerian who did pay for a visa , they gave him a visa that said he was coming to work as a bricklayer . Guess what he is doing in Qatar ? He 's a bricklayer ! Making nothing , working his tail off and living in a trailer with 16 other people ! And he has a graduate education . What can be done for this man ? NOTHING ! If he leaves his job he can be arrested and jailed . I hate to say he deserves it , but you should learn from his folly . He would tell you the same thing . Mandi

I believe a few shops in the souq sell them pre-modded . No clue on the recent prices .
deepb . . which souq ?
Not sure , I think the name of the souq is souq falah .
these souqs are known for ripoffs , , specially wen it comz to electronics ... and they dont sell pre-modded 360s for sure . . best guarantee services and standard prices are offered by marts like virgin , carefour , toys r us ... etc. . .

No qualification required ... as far as I can recall .
since you 're over 50 pts you are welcome just click the <i> request membership </i> and wait for group admin approval .
check the guidelines on their group homepage .
I have requested membership for months then I tried again today but it seems that they do n't approve just anyone . I have my other friend applied for membership for months now she never hot approved either . I just feel sad I really want to belong to a group of people of my own culture and interest . But anyways ... all I can do is wait ! ;-RRB-
Just a guess , maybe the moderator is outside Qatar , vacationing in Philippines , he/she does n't have internet connection . name it ... .
Carol is always having Ezdan nightmares she doesnt want to add one more to that . <imgÂ src=http://www.qatarliving.com/files/images/Da.gif>

Get a ticket back home ... more and more all I can think about is the day I can FINALLY book my ticket out of here for good !!!! I wish I didnt feel such a big sense of responsability at work and then I would just leave now . No matter how much money they are paying ... -LRB- and it is a good 6 figures salary -RRB- it is still not enough to put up with this place . Thats on my list to Santa Claus ... for me to go home this coming year .
Sandeep , 6 figure per year ...
Oh thanks for clarifying Gica , I was about to resign tomorrow morning thinking about my low salary . . <aÂ href=http://s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/?action=view&current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpgÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpgÂ border=0Â alt=Photobucket> </a>
Hehehe ... I save your a ** ...
6 figures per month . in qatari ryals . and cant wait to go home ... even if it is to make a lot less money than here !!! I am literally counting down the days . money DEFINATELLY is not everything !

I 'll try to get an appraisal in Toyota trade-in section . If their offer will not suits my expectation , then probably this goes for an auction to direct buyers Anyone knows how much the market value for this model ?
Yes . Trade in is less problem/head ache BUT less cost . Sell it to direct buyers will earn you little sum of money compare to trade-in but you have to deal with different types of people .
As others are saying , a Trade-in is less hassle for you , but you 'll get much less money for the vehicle . Selling it to a private buyer will get your more money but it will be much more of a hassle and potentially take a long time .
btw , what much is ur demand for lc 2004 model ?? would you like to share with us here . .
i do n't have accurate demand yet , but for sure a little bit higher than the market value ...
Try both and see who gives you the best price !
Sell it outside , there is no way that toyota dealership will pay you fair . Definitely much lower than market price so they can have profit for re-selling .
Only if housing is provided .
Basic or Package , it differ , if Basic , not bad at all , if package , you will eat steamed rice for the rest of your residency here ...
GO TO MEDICAL HEALTH CENTRE OF THE REGION IN WHICH U ABIDE LIKE IF U R IN UMMGUALINA THEN GO TO MUGHLINA HEALTH CENTRE OR IF IN RAYYAN GO TO THE RAYYAN ONE OTHRWISE FOR AL KHOR AL KHOR ONE .

HOWEVER IF U DNT WANT TO MAKE CARD U HAV TO PAY QR 30 PER VISIT . THESE INFORMATIONS ARE ABOUT THE GOV ONE IF YOU WAN NA MAKE YOUR TREATMENT IN ANY PRIVATE THEN U GO TO NATIONAL OR NEARBY THR U WILL FIND SOME WHO GIVE TREATMENT AT 5O QR OR SO . HOWEVER THERE R HOSPITALS LIKE APPOLLO U CAN HAV THERE BASICALLY THE GOV ONE IS AFFORDABLE ...
Go to HMC emergency , get what u need , later do ur health card for future requirement
No , it 's client approval which is approval should be taken from the main project client before starting the visa process .
Sounds like good advice from your employer
Yes , true they should get prior approval from the client or Consultant before they are able to hire you , means a copy of your CV is sent to them as well and you might be interviewed by them too . .
All jobs in Qatar on contingent on your getting a visa , so even if you come and go through the last few stages , your visa may or may not be approved . You would have to leave then and no compensation would be provided . Only you can decide if you want to take that leap . Thousands are successful , but if you are one of the very few who are not it can be devastating .
It is the time required to get your CV approved by the ultimate client -LRB- Ashghal etc. -RRB- . It 's for your benefit to get you approved before you hand your notice . As someone mentioned the visa process may still collapse but at least the client approval stage will confirm that the client will pay for your work lol . Your grade and salary is likely to be based on that as well . It took approx . 10-14 days in my case .
Any more thoughts
Yes , client approval is generally the preferred way to work for engineering consultancies . The main reason is that companies dont want to hire someone from overseas and bring them all the way to Qatar and then find out that the client does not like them for some reasons like lack of experience , etc. . Therefore , to save themselves the hassle and money , companies usually hire people officially once client has seen their CV and is happy to have them on the job . Hope this helps !

Archana.Sandy ... I recently bought an Omnia 2 , in Malaysia , and have used it for 2 weeks without problem . But now I 'm in Qatar , and i recieve a msg from the Qtel -LRB- telco -RRB- saying `` Sorry , your phone is not capable of accepting settings at this time '' . My contacts gets scramble , eg . i save my qatar friends number , but each time they call , only the phone numbers pop up instead of names , but each time i recieve sms , their names pop up . I look back at the phone contact , those names whom i save +974 -LRB- 1234567 -RRB- , each time they call , i only see their number -LRB- 1234567 -RRB- , but if they sms me , i can see their names .

sorry for the spell mistake its Toyota ** _______________________ '' Live for Nothing or Die for Something '' _______________________
It depends on your budget as well but i prefer Toyota Prado 2008
well budget is not a prob ... Alhamdulilah i am just asking which one is better ? Thanks _______________________ '' Live for Nothing or Die for Something '' _______________________
http://www.qatarliving.com/node/884191 Hey omar bhai , just go thru the above link . . i really want u to answer on the above link to one person BLABLU . . well i cant help u in deciding which model u want though ...
Prado for sure Omer . Cant compare both .
ok soniya jii no prob :-RRB- _______________________ '' Live for Nothing or Die for Something '' _______________________
Performance wise , I suggest you prado V6 rather than a CRV.CRV is a good family car.Trust me , never go for Prado V4 , It sucks big time.But prado is more common as well . .
Taste differ !
That is delusional Omar.I never claimed so.If your nonsensical comments are just to satisfy soniya , tell me man . . I can stand up for that!I have seen better . .
oh c'mon man its not for anyone . . i am just giving answer what you were saying ok bablu _______________________ '' Live for Nothing or Die for Something '' _______________________
Omar ... go for it ! Seven seater big family car V6 VX models are really good . you need to loose your pocket , it would be in the range of QAR 110-120k
hey Omar ... I used to lyk Honda CRV in canada , but later after riding it did n't like it much , honest opinion go for Toyata Prado 2008 ... it have more bold body then CRV . - : You Love Me Or You Hate Me But I will Always Be in Your Mind : -
Ye ye , I know . . I can make out your face expression now . . Its ok dude , I should n't have told that in public rather use a PM.Next time bro , if you come to scratch me . .
Omar of course Prado V6 . It is powerfull , safe , has good options and look , and good aftersale price . The Prado v4 has a very weak 2.4 L engine -LRB- taking into consideration the weight of the vehicle and the double AC -RRB- .
hahaha bablu that 's what you Think . . no prob 's i can understand :-RRB- _______________________ '' Live for Nothing or Die for Something '' _______________________
another vote for toyota prado ... listen to the sound of silence ...
CRV looks better
prado peace : -RRB-
Prado is perfect .
Your question is difficult to answer and the only person who knows the answer is you.If you want a mean powerful offroader that can seat 7 in comfort then Prado is your choice . On the other hand you want a slick city cruiser that can manage minimal offroading then go for the CR-V . It looks real nice if you mod it just right . Both cars are good value for money . If it is the 2.4 L Prado you are looking at then definitely go for CR-V as the 2.4 L mill which performs well in the Camry is n't good enough to get the gargantuan across town . Ride comfort is higher in the CR-V and handling is near saloon levels . The Prado on the other hand is belittled by the humble Corolla around a round about . Road noise levels are also higher in the Prado especially when wearing Bridgestone donuts . You also get more toys for the money you pay on a CR-V . Prado can go just about anywhere with it 's optional 4WD system with rear and central diff lock . It 's got a huge petrol tank that takes ages to fill and ages to empty . The value never depreciates and looks like it never will as the 2010 Prado MAY soon turn out to be damp squib and a POSSIBLE chink in Toyota 's armor as full time 4WD may not be everyone 's cup of tea . In the end listen to your heart . If you need further help PM me as I just love cars and all things related ... also check out www.drivearabia.com for more opinions and reviews .
Live life king size . so go for prado it is more efficient and powerful than CRV . It is the best substitute for big daddy land cruiser . Ejaz M Khatib mobile : +9746787860
toyota is best car
both are nice cars ... but crv looks better :-RRB- <strong> I may not be PERFECT but PARTS of me are pretty AWESOME ! </strong>
xpresso , good job , i should have asked you before i got my car :-RRB- anyway i 'm proud of it Yalla !
Honda CRV has one of the best engines ... i would choose CRV without second thoughts . .
<b> <i> ... prado for sure !! :o-RRB- ... ... ______________________________________________ </b> </i> ... why worry and have wrinkles ... when u can smile and have dimples :o-RRB- ... .
My suggestion would be the toyota prado 2008 ... honda crv is good but prado is better ... thx ...
If decision making for the selection seems difficult , play Eeny , meeny , miny , moe and pick one : -RRB-
Have you tried approaching Starfish Lane nursery ? I ca n't be sure what their payscale is like but it 's worth a try.Good luck .
hmmm ... which nurseries are these ? I havent tried Starfish . What about Elder Tree ? Does anyone know their salary range ?
Please help me to look for a school who is in need of a preschool teacher ... I really need a job ... message me or email me - ngirl_162004@yahoo.com thanks !
Please help me . . I need a job , a teaching job ... If you know some schools hiring for a teacher , . , , pls message me so I could apply ... thanks !
the school where i work the starting salary for nursery/reception teacher is 5500QR . but if you have experience or masters it will be a little bit more .
hi , well once i applyed for a nursery , and asked how they will going to pay me they told me their range salary from 2000 up to 3000 only .
QR 2500
There are lot many nurseries at Salwa Road , near wholesale market .
We got our from the vegetable market on Salwa Road - from Ramada , past decoration roundabout and u-turn at the next roundabout behind the shops . They also sell pots and will pot the plant for you free of charge if you buy both .
Yes above answers are correct , you can go there at 5 or 6pm the shops are open . Salwa road , whole sale market not only plants are there , vegetables , fruits , fish . . anything !
I will suggest you Green Land nursery , its in between Aramex Roundabout & Mamoura Signal -LRB- New Mamoura complex -RRB- If you are coming from Doha , cross D Ring Road Signal & Mammoura signal , go straight 200 meters on your right ... Near Archidron Construction office .
is it that you need these plants for home or in your office.i could suggest you EDEN internatinal , they did it for us in our office.i do not know there exact location but i do know there contact num :5238568 . they even do the maintenace work like watering it etc , which makes us free from takin care of it n it looks lively evrytime .
i never heard of it , are you sure al sadd tower it 's real name
AL SAAD TOWER -LRB- 3B + G +14 + B -RRB- located in Old Salata . http://www.alkhayaringroup.com/en/?q=content/burj-al-saad thats all I was able of finding !
Well if i am Right this is located in Al Saad just on the opposit side to the BMW show room and Old HONDA show room at Al Saad area just after the siganal near Le Sigal Hotel . It is very easy to locate-God bless
isnt it near the Corniche ?
i think that the new Barwa buildings on C ring rd. . next to patchi shop Suhaim bin Hamad Street ... call 800 4444 http://www.waseef.qa/en-properties/barwa-al-sadd
You can contact the Head of Dept for the Food Control Dept at 4347633 . Maybe they can assist you .
In normal situations the Doha Municipality is responsible for carrying out inspections in this regard . As mentioned , complaints can be made through the Municipality website www.baladiya.gov.qa under the food observation section . Alternatively , they can be reached on Food Observation Section - Doha Municipality Phone number : 4347631 - 4347663
I also recommend going public through the papers , I believe they have the most impact in such cases . Retailers have screwed up one time too many , and this needs to stop . I still can remember buying expired diapers for my infant from city center 's major retail shop , only to be given a cold shoulder by the manager and an offer for a credit note , at the end I made sure they learned their lesson <grin>
can u share us what brand these bottles so that we take precausion ...

why cancelled if only for emergency leave ? did you file EL from your company ? and how many months were you OUT of Qatar ? if 6 months , yes it would be cancelled really . if you did n't inform your company that you 'll be going for EL , probably they cancelled your visa . it 's called AWOL .
Do u want the reply in half English and Half Hindi ?
Yah , its 6 months now ... but only in your dream ! jejejeje Please read this . http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/AdvSearchResult.asp?cu_no=2&text=legal%20helpline
your company is a cheater . you should be entitled for a gratuity pay as per labour law . if you know someone close to you in that company , ask for their help . this cheating strategy must be reported to the labour dept. they should n't cancel your visa when you 're at EL . it 's a disrespectful way of treating their employees .
thanks for those who reply . . now i got an idea guys . . thanks a lot .

You can indeed be employed by Microsoft and buy Apple shares as many as you want !
Thanks buddies , Let me make my question more clear ... Once I invest to another company to become a share holding partner , my name and ID no will be reflected on the company 's CR & Computer card as well . Here ... Will I be facing any legal problems ? Does my present employer have the right to take any legal action against me ? Please kindly advice ... Shan
I am taking a business law class and as I have studied , you will have no problem as long as you do n't take chances from your employer to benefit the company you have shares in . and as long as you are honest about it and still work for the best of your company `` the one you work for '' you will have no problem .
Thanks buddy ... In the event that my present employer does not give me NOC or release , is it possible to me to move immediately from my present employer to new company where I have invested ? I think I need a legal advice on this matter . Rgds , Shan

Sounds like you need to re configure it . Mine is always going down and thats what I do to get it started again .
It can be your router is not configured to have act as a DHCP server or that your ADSL connection is down . Check the router 's WAN light is active . If so you need to configure a IP manually
use the meter for a 6 to 7 km within doha and for a half day , better rent a car and bring a friend with you to drive it
Thanks for your answer . I have n't been able to get a meter taxi yet though there are a few places I need to visit . Thus it 's on without a meter . Question is however what a good price is .
ur pic is horrible man
I think for a 6 km example , a meter can cost you a flag down of 3QR and a 50dhms/kilometer so .5 x6 +3 = 6QR but I think without a meter can cost you 10QR
Thank you snowwhite , your pic looks cute ,
Thanks a lot Johnpur , that helps a lot . Note to self : haggle and do n't accept the price the drivers tell .
mean i feel uncomfortable while putting on a comment lookin at ur pic Life is a play with out a script ...
you 're welcome sunflowergirl :-RRB- : -RRB-
now u can take a round of city also with these ... ... ... : - -RRB-
QR 2 per km ... is fair for those without meter ! Of course the private cabs would insist that you pay them QR4 per km .
it 's ok snowwhite , a lot of QL members feels the same way you do
look in aljareer bookstor

Stunt voip/Calls is the best and cheapest of all

can my husband will be able to bring my mother here in qatar since we need helper?what kind of visa my husband will apply for her?and what are the expenses ?
Hope allah will help your mother and inshallah you will not get visa ----- please try to respect mother and care of her and this is your timeto help her not use as a helper sorry but is tooo bad Significances of the prayers .

i am sorry for the word -LRB- term -RRB- i used in my statement.what i mean is someone i can trust to watch over my son while I am away . . I am still the one who will do household chores etc. . I did n't mean to make her as servant . .
Muslims have high regards to their mothers that 's why they get offended when they read something like this ... `` mothers who will be asked to do the household ''
in my opinion it is not worth , coz u can apply ur self for the post which u feel that it suits u free of cost
Thats kinda scam . there are too many jobs which offers these service for free of cost . try them for ex : www.gulftalent.com
No , it 's not worth paying for . You will be a victimized by these scammers once you paid $ 200 . It 's the same person you paid that will pretend to hire you later . So be smart !
Not worth it . .
I have registered my CV with them and up till this day have neva been asked to pay or even gotten a job offer or even a interview from them , so I asume it is not worth it unless , u have the right passport ... lol

download a converter from the net . its free .
Sony Soundforge can do that . It extracts the audio from the CD and you can save it then in whichever format you want .
mj try to rip it first using windows media player then download allok video converter it has most of the formats .

mjamille you just use the windows media player and put the CD and click RIP it will convert the . cda to . mp3 .
yes , basically : The . cda files are representations of CD audio tracks and do not contain the actual pulse code modulation -LRB- PCM -RRB- information . Cda files can be played only from a CD-ROM . This means you have to ` rip ' the song from the CD using a software , there are plenty of them around the net -LRB- I 've been using Soundforge and it 's very cool even if maybe is quite difficult for a newbie to understand -RRB- .
I am sure you can use Ashampoo to rip it and convert it to mp3 . Perhaps other softwares such as Nero can do it as well ... I am not aware . Google search , perhaps you find a freeware for that purpose .

Yes , as you have a family status your wife can get a job here . She will be in your sponsorship and once she has a job offer the company would be applying for a job permit . The thing you have to consider is her chances of getting a job as it depends also on her experience and minimum salary you would be expecting . Anyways may god guide you . Cheers , Steve
Yes , once she gets her resident visa then her employer can apply for the job permit . Cheers , Steve
ok . and what are those factors ?
How in the Sam Hills you persist being annoying ?
errrm ... is n't that the whole point of it being password protected - to stop people ` borrowing ' their internet connection ? Two options - ASK for the password - or get your own interent . And what do mean ` borrow ' ? THis implies a short term loan period after which you re-pay or return . So , do you intend to return the internet usage you have ` borrowed ' ?
You are a thief !
Go to corniche ! You can borrow internet connection there . Just do n't forget to return it .
pay for ur own internet ! some nerve u 've got putting such question on the forum ! u 're a thief and u shld be ashamed of urself !
may be you 're planning also to borrow your neighbor 's underwear . . : -RRB-
you give qlers a bad name ... what a dirt bag
First of all check that from where it is signeling , then trace that place , go there , ask to whom does that internet belongs ... and ask for a password ... hehehehe ... damn i am good
go to router set up change a password u r self easy.make sure u will not su ... . c
This is really funny ... what u r doing mate aint called borrowing ... its called STEALING :--RRB- Get ur own connection dude .

Buy a netbook ! I have 2 laptops and a netbook ; when this netbook came , I seldom touch my laptops ; netbooks can go 8hrs without recharging ; very light that you can carry it whenever you go out ; connects to wherever there is a hotspot ; does everything a laptop does ; and its a lot cheaper than laptops unfortunately , it was confiscated by my daughter on my last vacation
Thanks for the info . Any suggestions on which netbook to buy ?
A netbook is a low power computer . They do n't come with optical drives -LRB- the last time I looked -RRB- , and they can be used to play games that are on teh internet . Do n't expect to play games that require fancy graphics cards . I have a MSI Wind U100 and it has been fine as a back-up for me when travelling . I use my desktop for all the graphics hungry work . The nice thing about the netbook is that it is light , has a long battery life and is easy too carry around .

Well there is something called a Borrowing card where the sponsor allows him to work for another for 6 months and this is renewable for another Six months . But i am not sure as to how long a person can work on this Borrowing Card . I think its just One Yr - 6 + 6 - and after that Immigration will ask the person to trf the visa . You can check this out woth the Mandoob of your company .
Urrmmmm No i havent exactly LEFT , , , , just not here like i used to be ... :-RRB- and do i know u ??? :-RRB- Im doing good ... thanks ... : -RRB-
yes u do know me ... my old a/c got blocked due to some reason . check ur inbox .
geez how can you let him get away with it ? you should 've done something right away when he did that to you . . he must 've thought you have no objections over what he did !
they thought that all filipinas are easy girls ... . bec some of our kabayans are like that ... very very sad ...
So thats it , its clear it is not an indecent proposal anymore . It 's abuse . . so ask some good Kabayans here to got to the police and report the incedent .
Ahh ok . and also because here in QL many Filipino post nonsense or sometimes sensitive nonsense issues that we bacame laughing stuff here . pansin ko lang .
yeah right ... pansin ko din
Have the proof ready . a recorded fone convo with enough evidence will do . Save the file in a pc or a memory card to have it safe if someone forcefully deletes it from fone . Report to the management and police , together . Dont leave the moron from this , he should not do this to another girl .
agree , if you really want to complain , do it now . if u do n't , wait for another kiss or hug heheheeh
i have this feeling that you liked what he did to you . because in the first place , you did not even made any action when he kissed you on the neck . jeeezzz ...
Get some proof then talk to your boss that you felt your being harass so he should stop . If he did n't change for about a week then go ahead and report him at least you try to warn him .
pcgeek , that 's exactly what I said earlier ...
u let him kiss un in the neck ... damn
or maybe she was shocked at what happened , let 's hope it 's for that reason ... but I hope if he ever tries again , that she get the courage to stand up for herself and do something ... for her own sake . .
if possible change your job .
just get your soccer shoes on and kick his both balls and get your name in world record list for kicking 2 balls at a time .
he threatened me once , he told me that he has some friends in the CID . and he has some connections with the police .
cherry he is bullshyteing you , do n't get scared and tell him to fcuk off . report directly to the owner
you 're doomed if you let some jerk scare you off like that . . do something and do it now !
that is a false threat . You just complain to capital police directly . But you need proof ennough I think -LRB- Not sure -RRB- .
i 'm afraid of him . do n't know what to do . I 'm the bread winner , i can not afford to loose my job .
He is bluffing about the connections . Call his bluff now .
i saw an ad pen cam buy that record all and show it to the police .
record him like flor said ... . . use ur fone kiddo ... DONT BUCKLE
try to be nice with him and grap him into net by taking video record to him trying to make sex with you it 's easy not hard then you threaten him orrrrrrrr talk to his wife
Where is lemontree , he can provide tips for recording : P
cherry i can understand ur feelings , this once happened with me , when my HR manager -LRB- She -RRB- offered me in same way . Better u report him to capital police .
if ur mobile has video recorder try to use it but be careful ok ... damna that boss ... he is crazy really ...
it 's complicated , thought sometimes he 's good to me . and he 's always giving me overtime pay which i really need to pay off my debt in the Philippines .
Has your boss got a boss ?
anyone can help me in the capital police and explain it to arabic ?
LOL ... cherry ... u can get the capital police station number in the tel directory ... dont let this guy get away ... he is just using your need for his own greed ... .
Cherry u are still confused . Do n't show him any weaknesses , your boss is thinking all filipina 's are the same , he might do this thing in some women before , he might be expert of this activity . Dont be afraid to lost your job otherwise you will loose dignity etc ... you know what i mean . BE STRONG AND FIGHT !
make sense ...
So many good advices . Its up to you . If you dont want to be abused , so fight and never let somebody do it to you . You can talk directly to some Kabayans here . You 're boss might also be here in QL and if thats youre real name and picture this will be disadvantageous to you .
you better do this ask for assistance of POLO locate in Bin Omran . NO NEED ARABIC TRANSLATOR
IF THIS YOUR REAL IDENTITY , CHANGE YOUR PROFILE AND NAME NOW AND REMOVE YOUR PHOTOS . YOUR BOSS MIGHT BE AROUND . YOU WILL BE IN DANGER . HE WILL HAVE AN IDEA NOW HOW TO GET GETAWAY WITH THIS . YALA ... MAKE YOURSELF INVISIBLE .
avoid accepting any gifts from him . He might think that u also likes him or giving him false hope ... at the end he can used it against u. . . SO BE CAREFUL !
So what if he knows somebody from the CID ? why need to be scared if u know that ur in the right position ?
Ana ganda what you the same ?
just call 999 and they will come for you , police in here are good and kind unlike other countries .
thanks just1s . thanks the courage . i will try it at night , he told me to take OT again today .
Azi is right . . but still someone can help her . As you said its Indecent Proposal , Its just a PROPOSAL ... but if he started abusing you , its another story . You can report him to the police/CID , OWWA or maybe the Philippine Embasy .
brave_heart its not only proposal , he started to kiss me lately in my neck and hold my hands while giving some documents .
hi there , 1 -RRB- first get solid proof of his advances . 2 -RRB- Do not show encouragement by smiling when he offers you something you dont like . 3 -RRB- Inform the HR or change the department you work at . 4 -RRB- You may be scared , but dont let it show in your face or body language 5 -RRB- Use , going to the Police as a last resort .
you can teach her your trick that happened with you when you were assaulted by group of chicks and stripped
so sometimes he is good to you , that does n't excuse him harassing you !
That was his payment and now he expects sex in return . Not unheard of in these parts , tell him firmly NO and do n't report then .
apparently u r confused .
Oh Da do n't remind me of that nightmare : P
Cherry , Make sure before you report anything , you have to provide a solid proof of evidences or anything that leads to harassment . This is Qatar you can not just go to police and tell them that you are being harassed by your boss . Make a seamless recording -LRB- sounds or video -RRB- or photos from mobile that he can not recognize . always turn on your mobile videos before talking to your boss by simply holding your mobile , -LRB- at least voice can be recorded -RRB- .
call 999 now and complain , the police will give u full support and they will arrest ur boss -LRB- lebanese -RRB- if they terminate you the immigration officer will give you release and u can find another sponsor ... chow cheer up men .
uhh why do I get the feeling that you do n't really wan na sort this issue out ?
where is the capital police located ? i ca n't speak arabic .
Try to record a call with him on ur mobile , ask him to call u after work time and give him all the freedom to say what he wants to say and record it , then go to the police or labor office .
yes sure you enjoyed it and ended up in hospital with energy drips going up your body
ofcourse ur job is important , but u ca n't continue ur job like this . may be the situation will become worse.so better collect some proof and report to higher person than him in ur co. or report it to police . collect proof first . . using pen cam as darude suggested . . or ur mobile -LRB- if it has recording option -RRB- .
what kind of ENERGY DRIPS DA ? ... hey WK u didnt tell me this one !!! ... LOL
britexpat ever u heard of `` a fcuked arse ca n't be agressive ''
Da I am not Tarzan after all , could n't handle them all : -LRB-
take print of this thread & give it your boss .
they sucked out all his power and the poor guy had to crawl to the hospital .
It seems you are left with two choices , either to give in or to make a bold resistance . Hope you find the wisdom to do the latter without compromising .
you should be prepared of those things before coming here . do n't be stupid scared . be smart . outsmart him . be cunning . and do n't let money be a reason of your demise . pera lang yan .
if you think you are weak ! I 'm not being biotchy but : - <b> to cherry23 </b> : Your company have an HR Officer , right ? Why not discuss this with them ... to give it appropriate action . Secondly , if you gon na complain to the police , you better stand firm with your complaints ... as this would be a long , tedious , messy situation wherein your work will get jeopardized in the process . They ould easily turn the table on you , you being new in the job , in the company . It ' ; ; be your words against your manager . Third , Maybe your manager misread your actions towards him . You being amiable to him and friendly may have been read/understood that you like him ... maybe you should do a self-assessment . Fourth , If you really want to keep your job and the sexual harrassment to stop ... TELL HIM FRANKLY . He 's educated enough to take the point . He may do something stupid for being rejected but as long as you do your job well , he ca n't have anything to use against you to terminate you . From what you 're posting about the situation being `` complicated '' ... it 's not . YOU WANT THE MONEY FOR THE OVERTIME he 's giving you ... but YOU DO N'T LIKE THE ATTENTION ... THEN SPEAK OUT YOUR THOUGHTS AND TELL HIM THAT YOU CAME HERE TO WORK AND EARN ... NOT TO DO ANY TOMFOOLERY ... I hope you get my point ... and do n't be so naive .
tinkerbell10 - i just hope you are right . but at least she should have move away from that pervert and not letting him kissed her . because this guy can say `` ohh . . she is not resisting , i can do what i want '' .
Cherry something is not right here ... you say that lately he has started kissing your neck ... hello - but how does he get that close to kiss you on your neck ?? its not an easy thing to do so he has to be pretty close and comfortable to be able to do that and what about you ?? you just stand there quietly while he does it . i know one thing , if any guy came that close to me I would certainly notice and move away ... So I tend to think there is more to the story . . maybe you were nice and cosy with the guy and now that he wants more you are panicking ... and to tell him you have a BF well thats just real clever ... SOrry I dont buy your story - there is something else you are not telling us ...
And another thing ... I am sure your office/company has a complaint policy or greivance policy ... why go to police and make it into some great big story of he knows this and that person ... simple answer - report to your HR department or to his boss and get it over and done with ... Like I said before - big story for nothing and there is something you have not told us which is basically that you would rather have the money etc then complain about him . Where is your pride !!!!
If you are really interested in getting this guy off your back , draw the line in stone , not sand . Most guys do understand when a woman replies with a firm `` No '' , and they usually back off . It 's when you keep moving the line that they start playing around . So be strong and say `` No , Thankyou , NOT INTERESTED '' . You have to decide what is more important to you , a few measly extra bucks or your self respect and dignity .
its simple , DONT BE A DUMB!do what is the best to caught this guy .
hit directly his FOREHEAD then sign ur name ! hahahahahaha ! Is there any company here selling teargas ???
You told an Arab guy you had a `` boyfriend '' ? You seem to be too new here ... You have to tell them `` Married '' and not shaging with `` boyfriend-S '' ...
cherry listen do this and think about it ... your boss is lebaness so the higher boss is qatari , dont worry to lose your job because he is only a GM there but he is not your sponsor , the qatari is the one who will kick him out of the office . . if you not scared now . . this are the step . . before entering your boss office take your mobile with u and start recording something . . if u can do video more solid evidence and voice record is good also but u need or conversation is involved about harrasing to u , do u get what i mean . if you get that go to the police ... or use that evidence to scare him away ... and dont smile on him dont give him anything to deserve your kindness . . trust me on this ... because we are the same on this kind of situation ... in this country u need to be strong and smart specially to us girls . .
. . tell your BF about your problem , maybe he can help you also .
ahihi ... `` boyfriend-S ''
Is it so common in Qatar that women are victims of these kinds of wankers and have to ask people what to do because they assume there is no justice for women here ? Anywhere else I think this would be a given : report him to his superior and the police .

Hey guys out here advising this person to report to the bigger boss is more stupid then the original act as the bigger boss is more busy having a good time himslf at the companys expense and the lower manager knows exactly what the big boss is upto and what he needs to do to keep him quiet and happy so he also can go about his dirty tricks and harassment while the big boss is at his own tricks and games

There is no point of bringing her my dear . because the time needed to teach her enlish wont be less then the time needed for you kid to be a teenager my advice , go find another one best of luck
I find they pick up language quickly but you will need to speak to her non-stop all the time . Maybe this will not be ideal if both of you are working and the kids are st home . I find it helps when she plays with the kids a lot as kids have a great deal of patience and they feel more comfortable around the kids than adults as there is little embarrasment .
a real need open all doors . there is no barier , I am sure your kids will speak Bhasha Indonesia.right now shaikh 's sons and daughters are speaking Tamil -LRB- they have two Tamil maids -RRB-
DPS Agreed with Mr. Kareem , additional for islamic studies .

Take a look at the above links . . It may help u out to take ur decision ... thanks . .
birla is a better shool
1st place DPS 2ND place DMIS 3RD place BPS 4th place MES CHOICE IS YOURS.IF U DONT HAVE MONEY PROBLEM DPS IS BETTER.THEY HAVE MANY ACTIVITIES IN THERE SCHOOLS .
DMIS is the best as CBSE school in doha better than DPS AS 1 ... it allows child to develop without pressure ... . no home work / assinments 2 ... . . gives very good food ... 3 ... has after school activties free of cost like arts and sports ... 4 . takes kids to picincs outside ... 4 ... teachers are very good and impartial ...
DPS also has all the things stated above - no homework / assignments at home , extra - curricular activities , 100 % participation of students in extra curricular activities , good teachers , good teaching standards - everything except FOOD :-RRB- . Food - it 's always better for kids to have home made food . There are a lot of students shifting from dmis to dps , since the change of management from varkey 's . My kids and my sisters kids study at dps and I am happy with everything except their current infrastructure . Their new school will be ready only in 2012
DPS ... thats only if your company is sponsoring for your childrens education ... a bit expensive but good teaching staff ...

Soy milk and tofu are available in all major supermarkets but I am not sure about the yeast .
There are a lot of vegans here , mainly from the subcontinent . I do n't know about the yeast in particular but the rest is available anywhere .
Great ! Thanks cherukkan and marycatherine . Good to know I 'll be in good company and wo n't starve ! PollyJ there are lots of great reasons to be vegan : animal rights , health , lower environmental impact and peace of mind to name a few . I feel much healthier since becoming vegan . I have more energy , I do n't get as tired after eating meals , I lost weight and I 'm happier knowing my actions are inline with my thoughts and ethics . Of course , everyone is different and for some people -LRB- like Boer -RRB- its harder to give up the things they 've always loved . For me it was a great choice and I 've never looked back . Give it a go ! I promise it 's not as hard as you think !
You wouldnt have a problem being vegan in Doha , besides lacking the Daiya cheese that i love so much . Check out some indian restaurants around !

Thanks for your kind advise and I will be coming to join someone for a while and I will try and get a job as soon as possible . I have been applying for jobs online but with no success for long . I could n't get any one to help me , I do n't know if you could be of help . Thanks man
This is n't the promised land ! Jobs are scarce even here . For some strange reason people think Qatar has jobs growing on trees .
Yea Muan , one love muan , you need to arrange your self wella muan , that amount wey you call no go take you anywhere ooo muan . But luck different sha . Welcome , one love my brother . Shebi you don get where you go stay muan ?
I am coming with three months business visa and I am expected to get a job before the expiration of my Visa . But I do n't how things work over there in terms of Job . Please advise !
hahaha eddy , $ 700 would be enought for you to spend 2 days in Doha . . LOL
I would not advise coming here without a job or someone to stay with . Finding a job is hard work and can take some time . Doha is expensive and you will not last more than 2 weeks on uS $ 700 . It is best to save the airfare and try applying for jobs first . .
no : -RRB-
no : -RRB-
Yup ... its new ... Very good sitting ...
You must have logged on to that Qatarhub website someone was promoting here yesterday ...
Go to Markhya 's Burger King ... Around It you will find a shop called `` Anime World '' ... Theres Also one in Gharrafa 's Mobile market ...
The best way I 'd say is to buy it online , there are a ton of websites that sell anime and manga .
Jarir bookstore has a decent collection . I have a few books , may be you could collect them from me
m a huge anime fan along with my friends we searched everywhere for Anime and manga and to say the least there isint many in Doha but Here are some locations i suggest : - Anime : Video Saqr Stores - City center - Landmark - Markhiya etc. . Virigin Megastore - Villagio -LRB- The only one with anime -RRB- Anime Wonderland - Gharafa -LRB- Its probably closed now -RRB- - Manga : Al Rawnaq - Markhiya = Thats all the places i know off . I Seriously suggest you order it from online or you can go to Dubai mall in dubai it has a HUGE 15 Ft long Bookshelf of manga . = -RRB-
There is a bookstore that sell manga books -LRB- naruto , naruto shippuden , Hunter X Hunter , vampire knight and more -RRB- It 's in Qatar university and student center in Qatar foundation .
Gold is the same price the world around . The only difference is the `` making charge '' and tax for some countries such as Egypt . Dubai probably has the least extra price on top of the gold 's value for that day . If you do n't know the day 's price for , say , 22k gold , do n't try to buy some . The merchant will have you figured out in a flash . Mandi
same prices but the desgins are totally different from any were else
I found Three items here in Qatar are cheaper than in India 1 . Petrol 2 . Saffron 3 . Dates -LRB- But you have to collect it from the road side palm tree -RRB-
I think you heard it wrong from somebody , compare to Saudi and Dubai , all the stuff are much costlier here . So , think twice before you pick something from Qatar . Yeah , you will get pure Gold from any GCC country than India . Happy shopping !!!! .
In qatar gold price is cheap compare than india , but making charges are high . so final comparsion qatar rates are higher than india Exampletoday rate in india u can have 1 gm -LRB- 22Ct -RRB- 1250 , but qatar 1 gm -LRB- 22ct -RRB- 100QR -LRB- inclulde making charge -RRB- = 1310 .
Andrew is Practical man . He is correct
ksrsiva ... also include the exchange rate fluctuation ... The things cheape here in Qataar are : 1 . Petrol 2 . Cars 3 . Ok ... you dont have to pay for dates . I mean the fruit !
indeed brit , but in Pakistan Supreme Court is taking things in to their Hand ... Just like the Disqualification of PM of Pakistan Yesterday ...
Oh dear the election result has now been suspended pending an investigation ...
Moza : Change does not come from a vote until after the civil war has begun , been fought and one side has won , then the vote means something .
I think Politicians our worst then our Army ... Be it Marshal Law or Democratic Government , Corruption is every where , but then again Why do More then 75 % of Pakistanis Support the Army ... Egypt never had Revolution in the First Place , Face was changed but Until Now Egyptian Army are Calling the Shots . .
Hey Idiot ,
Yes either Shaffalah or the Learning Centre , both part of Qatar Foundation . Aisha-Taweela
Check with Shaffalah and the Learning Centre as noted above , but you may not find the same type of programs you are accustomed to in North America - not saying they 're bad or anything , but different . Conditions like Down 's Syndrome exist here as they do everywhere in the world - however , often children are not seen - what I mean is , they 're often kept at home , where they will be safe but exposure to the outside world is limited . Not all parents do this of course , but whereas in North America I 'm never surprised to see someone with a disability -LRB- whether physical , mental , or congenital -RRB- at the mall or the grocery store or the movies - it 's unusual enough here for me to `` notice '' them on a conscious level . This is merely an FYI in terms of adjusting to the local `` culture '' on this issue , another point is that many people from the subcontinent `` stare '' at people and things they consider to be different -LRB- hey , I 'm one of them when I go out for a walk with the dog , I try to look at it as I 'm a form of entertainment - half of the dog and pony show so to speak -RRB- it can be disconcerting especially when you first arrive . I 'm sure you and your family would be able to get along fine and I hope the programs on offer at these organizations will be useful . Signature line > `` You ca n't fix stupid ''
Do n't even think about it . You might be able to get a place in a mainstream school provided you pay for a special needs assistant -LRB- untrained -RRB- for your son . Do n't come .
Compass takes special needs . I know of at least one family who has a Down 's child there , although I have no idea of the severity . I would contact them to see if they can help otherwise , as others have said , I would n't come to Doha .

Al Shamal road -LRB- Old Alkhor road -RRB- . It 's a long way distance . Go through new road which is after golf club . when you pass the golf club keeping your right then you will find a roundabout . Just take right from this roundabout & go straight till you arrive to Al Takira .
on the top floor of City Centre . Opposite end to the cinema . Its a mobile phone shop I think but theresa AJ sticker on the window . Its expensive though . QR 365 for the world Cup package and another QR 270 for 12 months subscription for all the channels . I had heard Mozaic were offering a package but when I phoned to enquire they operator said they can not reach an agreement with AJ . That might change tho . Ive paid because i dont want to miss it ...

There is a stall next to Paul 's in Villaggio and another stall next to Next in The Mall . Both sell the cards .
If you go down to the Sofitel hotel building , around it you will find a lot of electronic and accessories shops in that area , just walk into one and ask for the Cards .
Certainly it is not over the counter , but you could visit the nearest health center and get a prescription for it .

Only Allaah knows !!!
Hope i could , i am eager to eat hyderabadi dishes ,
i am stuck up with some work , if i finishes early inshallah i will but chances are only 5 %
Thanks saeed , Eid mubarak to you too and everyone who celebrates .
Eid will be on Friday INSHA ALLAH.It has een announced on Qatar TV .
EID MUBARAK to all of u ... ! ! ! 30
I will turn religious for today and pray that it 's on Friday . . Pleaseeee
We 'll just have to wait . . Insha Allah . . it will be on Friday . . I do n't want Ramadan to end so soon : -LRB-
To begin with , al in Arabic means the and ilaah means God . In Arabic the denite article the is a part of the word and is not a separate part of it as in English , so when putting the two words together al and ilaah we get the word Allah or Allaah which mean the God . The i , the rst letter of ilaah has been omitted to facilitate the pronunciation . Note that the l in Allaah is a dark one . Now you must be wondering , what is the difference between the words Allaah and Allah , its simply a matter of spelling ; the spelling Allah is more common , but in I-MAG we adopt the spelling Allaah as it represents the true pronunciation of the word in standard Arabic . It is note worthy that there are two pronunciations of the word , one is a colloquial one to which the spelling Allah might be more suitable , and a standard and more correct pronunciation that the spelling Allaah best represent .
Eid can either b on thursday or friday , coz hijri months hav only 29 or 30 days ...
eid is confirmed on friday , coz last two months rajab & shaban were of 29 days , as per islamic calendar ...
no saeed bahi , still sourceless , but three consecutive months cant be of 30 days ... & everybody in doubt for eid to be on friday ... : -RRB-
EID is on Friday it is confirmed , but dont ask for source ,
relax , just enjoy Iftaar and wait for official call
i know how to . .
yes am looking for a male masseur ... anyone knows how to locate or contact them in Qatar ?
I am a Filipino ... how much if ever ?
I understand you will not have a residency permit ... RP that is ... without that you cant open a bank account ... the only way you can buy a used or a brand new car is to pay for it in cash since you wont be able to get a bank loan for that Good luck
If you DO get a residency permit , then you can open a bank account . If you 're goingto need an auto loan , the bank will only loan you money if your company or sponsor is on the `` approved list '' . If you 're not on their approved list , you 're not out of luck because Mashreq Bank and Al Khaliji Bank will loan you money even if you 're not on the list . This is assuming you have a very good salary and some documentation to prove it . good luck !
But will he even be able to get a driver 's license without the RP ? From what I understand you can drive for a week or two with some countries ' drivers ' licenses but not longer . So he would n't be able to either rent or buy -LRB- register -RRB- the car . Also , it 's illegal to work on a visit visa is n't it ? Subject to arrest and deportation if caught ?
I have a friend that is trying to do the same as you . Renting is expensive and if you buy a decent secondhand car you will have something to sell at the end of 12 months . My friend is here for 2 or 3 weeks every month and has been using a driver or renting a jeep at approximatley 5000-6000 Qatar Rials per month . I think you will need to get an International License or a short term Qatar license every time you renew you visa . I think about 200 Rials but not sure The problem is ownership of the car , you will need to register the car and also get insurance . I am not sure about these details . Please if you find out any helpful details please contact me 6730727
I hope this does n't end up being a duplicate because I do n't yet see the 2nd answer I just submitted . Anyway , first of all , a car rental agency will rent you a car if you do n't have a Qatari DL . However , you will not be covered under any insurance umbrella . Meaning , if you get into an accident you 're 100 % responsible for all repairs to the car up to the full prie of the car -LRB- unless it 's deemed the other drivers fault -RRB- . Yes , it 's technically illegal to work on a tourist or visit visa , but some companies will let you slide if you 're in the process of applying for an RP . You wo n't be able to buy and register a vehicle without an RP if you 're trying for a bank loan . You wo n't even be able to open an account . banks wo n't lend money to anyone unless yuo 're on their `` approved list '' . However , Mashreq Bank and Al Khaliji will give you a loan if yuo 're not on the list provided you have a good income and can put 10 % down . Even if you pay cash , I do n't think you can register or insure a new/used car without an RP .
I understand your position very well , but remember you CAN NOT process anything without a Residence Permit -LRB- RP -RRB- . When I say anything I mean it - Bank Account , Driver 's Licence , Vehicle Registration , etc. . Talk to your company and try to get a work permit and then an RP . Failing which ask the company for an allowance for a regular taxi . There are many individuals providing personal taxi services - although there are measures to ban this practice . Once again remember without an RP you can not process anything in Qatar . And if you meet with an accident while driving without an RP the Police ot the other party will simply put the blame on you .
why do n't you request then with your company to provide you one ... otherwise I would suggest that you should rent to avoid problem in future .
Yes u can buy by cheap price i have a car i want to sell it now it 's Maxima Nissan 98 model u can come and see if u want call me 5173177
try used cars it is a best way
i 'll try operas too ... ... Life would become Dull if there were no such Difficulties ...
With he being your sponsor , yes he can
yes ... as he is ur sponsor ...
Well life gets so funny and ridiculous out here . Imagine if your husband is thinking of doing that then what others can do to the less helpless persons
if he wants to cansel the visa then its possible without this its not possible he dont have right to block your exit why your husband dont like you my advice is this please love each other and solve your broblem my sister
What a fantastic relation between the husband and wife . Wife is planning to run away without informing the husband who might block the travel of his wife for no valid reason ?
Silver moon , y u want to runaway from ur husband ... ?? If any issues iamong u , plz sit around one table and sort out togother .
no and 100 no , he can not . any thing he has to go to court and make a case . he can not cancel your visa unless you make something against the law . if you are right then you can file divorce and change sponsor later and he can not do a damn thing.he can exit and come back any time you want . but if you exit and later he cancel your visa while you are outside the country then it is a problem beacuse you can not enter to file a case against him . make sure to solve everything before you leave .
nop he cant do this because i solve like ur problem?if you want just give a call to me i can help you . 55290390
BLACKCAT ... R U married ? Do you know the relationship between husband and wife ? when 2 fiends live for one week together they will have 100 problems But they solve and live again . and others will also help them to solve . BUT these two are living together and that husband has taken his wife to Doha , there are enough people here who and not bothering abt wife or children and keeping other girls and living an illegal family life . without appreciating this husband for taking his wife and facing trouble Why are u trying to spoil the life of two by giving these stupid advices . My sister . when it comes to family issues please do n't bring them to these type of community sites.cos there are are enough here to spoil ur family life.I do n't know what is the problem between u 2 . BUT remember all the problems comes to you cos of ur own mistakes .

Till today , I have not checked the mileage , every time fuel tank comes to qarter level go and fill full tank as it is cheaper .
average 20,000 km per year so a 2002 model could run 160K - / + todate
milage depends on usage average sedan -LRB- 1.6 L -RRB- car + / - 11kms per liter of gas
Dude . . u r in Qatar . forget about milege . Petrol is so cheap u should not think about milege ... If you are going for 4x4 then MAY BE you should consider
Why do you care ? gas is cheaper than water here .

The Govt vet is on the airport road its at a light that used to be parachute roundabout . Now their are lights there its a two storey bldg . But I do n't know their hours . I know they will do the rabies shot their and give you pills for worms . I think they will fix the cat but they are not so gentle with the animal .
thanks everyone ... i appreciate ur replies . I think i 'll just get the shots done at the govt facility.thanks once again .
There 's A Government one near the airport somewhere , but I just want to say that the conditions there are horrible , and they do n't treat the animals very well either . And half the time , they 're not even there ! I always take my cats to the Veterinary Surgery . It 's expensive , but I guess it 's pretty much worth it . They do everything , spaying , vaccinations and all . www.dohavets.com is their website , If you want .

Friend , There is government vet clinic near to parachute round about . If you are coming from air port side you can see the right side two storyed building before reaching the parachute signal . It is near to Doha Motors group . The timing is 7a . m to 3p . m. and Thursday upto 1.30 it seems . Friday and saturday are holidays . All Docotrs are very friendly and you can take your cats to that clinic . They helped me very much when I took my cats to India last year . Even still I am taking the street cats to that clinic only . All are very cordial and helpful . There is Dr.Ahmed , Dr.Habib and one Doctor from Sudan and another from Egypt . Clinic No . is 4560444 jaya
and also what are its opening and closing times ? .
Definitely Bliss SPA at W is too expensive and nothing compared to 4 seasons and Ritz . The area is little , there is a small pull and not all the facilities such as steam room , sauna , jacuzzi and other lovely area . Sorry for whom believe W is cool . It ' a just a building in the middle of the noise and sands . Plus it 's much expensive the 4 season . That 4 me remain the best in Doha . Without any doubt . P.s. I just know the man areas ...

as far as i know ultrasounds are not harmful as they use sound waves to see the baby and not radiation . my wife had one with almost every visit -LRB- we were in doha -RRB- but not every two weeks . but at least every month , some months more because we went to get second opinions .
I am following up with Hamad hospital for 3 months and I am almost 21 weeks . Usually they do the ultra sound once a month until the 32 -34 weeks when they start to do it every 2 weeks in order to make sure the mother and baby are healthy and knowing when the labor will start . I have asked that question and they ultra sound technician said that , if the pregnant lady did the ultra sound over 25 times during her first trimester it will be harmful for the baby . because the first trimester is when the development of the baby and his/her organs are developing . by the end of second trimester to the end of the third is only gain of weight and size . hope this helps www.bastook.com
no , at diagnostic level that too at later period of pregnancy it is safe.It is better to follow Hamad Hosp suggestion
There is no harm in doing frequent Ultra sound test
u said she is in her 38 months so she is about to have the baby any time now . so it it is normal to check on the baby freqently.nothing wrong with that .
Thanks to all of you.Your answers have really made me feel better because this is our first baby and I was a little worried about that . Once again thanks a lot ... ...
The less frequent the better . I had ultrasound every 2 weeks in my 1st trimester when i was expecting my youngest son . It is not recommended but I had a complicated pregnancy that was why . My son now 3,5 years old , healthy and happy . . Thank God . eventhough I had the same worries you had . So , have a wonderfull parenthood .
I had ultrasound done every month when I was pregnant -LRB- that was during the time when I went to private clinic -RRB- then I switched to Hamad Hospital and I had three more in the last trimester of pregnancy.No complications just to make sure everything was ok with my baby .
At the begining stage of preganancy you have to go for ultrasound each and every -LRB- 03 -RRB- months , to make sure your baby is healthy and safe , if any complecation occured found by the Doctor , they recommend for Frequent Ultrasound which is necessary ... - Naeem -

I am interested in both pool and gym . How much is the membership fee ? Where is the location ? I am coming from Mansourra .
Hey mate , try Oasis Beach Club . I am a member there . Pool is pretty cool . Gym is just alright . Overall its good specially in terms of money . Singles membership is subject to approval but it 's fine in most of the cases . However , if you do n't want permanent membership , there is an option to visit club on per day basis which is valid except weekends .
northernmagpie how are they priced ? also umk what is yearly cost for Oasis ?
Cigalle - QR2 ,000 for one month , QR8 ,000 for six Ramada - QR1 ,500 for one months , QR4 ,500 for six These prices are nothing short of shocking . umk - Oasis price ?
QR2800 per year QR50 or QR60 per day visits
3500 per year for family + 500 registration for new membership
You get what you pay for . Went to Oasis once and dude that place reeks and so depressing . Cigale is another extreme and besides their sushi bar , they are worthless to me . Let us know if you find anything in between these 2

It 's worth buying a GPS , though I never used it in Qatar . . but it is really essential at KSA . I am really using it a lot to get around in KSA .
Edifis i agree with you . . I bought a Garmin Nuvi some 5 months back , and it is soo handy and fun to use . . I Simply Love It ... : -RRB-
FA can you tell me from where to download maps of Turkey and Eastern Europe to the Navigator ?
Use NAVIGON ... its perfect solution for GPS in QATAR and around Gulf using Iphone
Now many of the Nokia models have free navigation and its really useful . You can even get the satellite view just like Google maps .
I 've got the Garmin latest 3d edition . its almst perfect . I bought it for my car trip to Dubai and it was very helpful showing all hotels , restaurants , landmarks , hospitals ...
Will let you know how it works when I land .
No need wasting your money for specific GPS unit , all you need is just a mobile phone with GPS capability . Install it with GARMIN for mobile and complete the map of the area you need . Or just used google maps if you do n't want get headache of renewal the maps . Im using GPS only to know where my position is and then figure out the fastest route because you know how often re-routing happened here in Doha .
HappyHorizon ... Too lazy ??? too tech savvy ????? or just too much money ??? :--RRB- . No offence intended . Agree with Darude . Friday mornings are best to drive around in Doha . Most people do not get out of their homes until after lunch . The best way is to just drive around in squares . U will eventually reach your starting point . And yes , road works never end in Doha . Welcome and Safe Driving
who told you that RP is must for GPS . Just take pp copy go to qtel or vodafone get the connection and buy phone from them simple

Change schools to mix with children that know better ?
Tell him the truth . Israel kills babies and civilians . The whole world knows it .
kids will be kids , but its grown up 's who needs to be more responsible . My daughter goes to one of the leading International school in Doha , where Muslim children are in minority . When she told her friends about her trip to Saudi Arab in spring break , one of the kids told her not to go because the ppl are bad there . she took the matter to the teacher and he confirmed it for her by saying yes there are bad ppl in Saudi . Now as a teacher , it beats me how he could be so irresponsible . A grown up should not feed these hate thoughts to children . So I had to explain me 7 yr old how there are good and bad in every part of the world , and every religion , we just avoid bad ones and stick with good ones . I thought raising children in mulsim country will be eaiser for me , but i guess raising kids is not easy no matter where you are .
I 'd explain both sides - and that neither are right . It 's an opportunity to help teach him possibly about how to draw his own conclusions , when presented with all sides of an issue . I remember vividly my parents doing the same with me when it came to nuclear weapons -LRB- I was the only five year old who could tell you what Hiroshima was and why it was bad - hippy parents -RRB- , the situation in Rwanda in 1994 , apartheid , etc etc. . THe fact is this country DOES have a huge slant , and i think it 's important for anyone , kid or adult , to think critically about things .
aLSO , it might be a good time to explain judaism anyway - it 's Purim season and that 's a fun jewish holiday :-RRB- I mean , you ca n't avoid learning about Islam here , may as well slot in the other religions too !
tell him when there is a war , everybody kills everybody . Tell him the WAR is BAD ! tell him everyone should live in peace . <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed . Antoine de Saint-Exupry </b> </i> <imgÂ src=http://cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif>
I take my hats off to you UMM !
While agreeing in totality with your first post tell him when there is a war , everybody kills everybody . Tell him the WAR is BAD ! tell him everyone should live in peace I disagree with the second one . When there is a war people are killed . The bullet fired does not take care that victim belongs to which religion . I cant stress more . But let me tell you that I believe in taking consideration of roots problem rather than just consequences thereof . Zionist Israel is responsible for the present crisis thats all ! And if you kill someone expect same reaction from other end .
Advocate when you were at school did you ever have to do a debate on a subject you did n't like ? I think it is good if schools do this as it forces you to look at other peoples values , and just because you think they are silly , etc they are still their values and how you can more effectively have a dialogue .
My son was playing with some neighborhood kids and they had said to him that Israeli planes were going to drop bombs on everyone and that they kill people when they find them ... got him really wound up and scared . So I explained to him that the other kids were Muslim , and they they believed certain things that we did n't necessarily believe in . They do n't they do n't eat pork , we do ; we believe in Santa , they do n't ; etc. . I then went on to explain about how some countries fight and go to war with one another and people get hurt and killed and it 's never nice , but it happens . And hopefully soldiers try to be as careful as they can , but sometimes women and kids and old people and animals get hurt and killed by accident . It 's sad but it happens . And then I explained that some of our best family friends are Jewish and/or Israelis , and I asked if he knew that -LRB- no , he did n't -RRB- , and then I said that I did n't think that our friends were bad people at all -LRB- he agreed -RRB- , and so I did n't think it was fair for people to say that ALL Israelis were bad . That there were good and bad people everywhere , all over the world . He kind of got the idea ... But it IS tough raising kids here ... and I know I am going to have to constantly fight this battle , because he will hear it from kids every single year -- on the playground , in class , everywhere . BTW , we had to do this song-and-dance on another controversial issue : homosexuality . My son came home one day and announced that when a man loves another man and gets married to him , it 's `` haram '' -LRB- LOL -- he did n't even know what that word meant ! -RRB- . So off I went on my soapbox , trying to explain to him MY point of view that there is nothing wrong with any two adults who love one another ... and that when he grows up , he can decide for himself what he thinks is right and wrong about a lot of things . And that in the meantime , he will hear a lot of different ideas , but that does n't necessarily make any of them correct or mean that he has to agree with them , even with ideas that I subscribe to . Whew ! It 's tough being a parent !!
would n't that be biased ?
but I do like the way Umm handled it . I have a friend , she is from England her husband from Lebanon . Her son when it was coming up to national day told her that in NO WAY was he going to have anything to do with Lebanon because his friends did not like Arabs . This boys goes to one of the ` supposed ' best schools in Doha . I told my friend , that if that was my kid , they would have gone to school with a Cedar strapped to their hand , some Lebanese food and Union Jack underpants . My thoughts are my own , but I doubt my Mum would agree with some of them .
that was nice ... i admire you that you have shown your son the two other sides of the coin ... yes , it 's really tough raising our kids here . .
thats wonderful because a young child 's mind needs to be moulded into a proper one and the circumstances and environment he lives in is a major factor in that . I would make sure that he remains as neutral as possible and when he grows up , then he can take sides
I think I might try to defuse the specifics of the question and focus on `` what is war . '' Explain why war is wrong and use the example of children being killed as a reason why we must all work to bring about peace . That way you do n't have to take sides in a we/they , Israel/Lebanon discussion at this point . Mandi
Totally agree with you Mandi ... it 's a sensitive issue
grandkruizer I assume you forgot to add that practically every country , race or religion in the world has a history of doing exactly the same thing , some still are
is when the teachers at school are the ones trying to spout their propaganda to the children .
Truth shall remain a truth ... . . you have to realize pain and agony of your fellow brothers and sisters . BOYCOTT ISRAEL - The Sponsor of Terrorism
base , you could simply explain that there are bad people in the world everywhere , not only in Israel . -LRB- for parents , i think , this is perhaps the saddest realization you could get -- that your child will be growing up in a world so screwed and f up that humans are treated like s * t in some parts of the world -RRB- truly sad indeed . btw , base make sure you know the school of your child and its environment . it would help if you placed here in a tolerant environment . mo lang !
You have to tell your kid : Never never blame the people and the country . The war - it 's political issues and government responsibilities . Jewish people are kind , religious and the most educated people in the world . They do n't kill babies . The government does . One government provokes , the other replies . NEVER NEVER teach you kids to hate JUST PEOPLE !!! JEWISH , LEBANESE , PALESTINIANS , AMERICANS babies are cute and sweet and all JEWISH , LEBANESE , PALESTINIANS , AMERICANS mothers and fathers love their children !!!
I would follow Umm Jake 's path , but also explain that Israel produces creatures like Tzipeee . -LRB- swooooooooooon -RRB-
Tell your son , just focus on his studies .
I enjoy reading this thread , the grand majority points at Israel as the big bad wolf . The problem you got , is too many personifications . All dress as sheep , the inside of those dresses of sheep , they are just deceiving and nastier werewolves . <imgÂ src=http://logo.cafepress.com/8/2817834.5660348.jpg> If God dropped acid , would he see people ? -- George Carlin
ISRAEL IS A TERRORIST REGIME
I think that politicians on both sides are responsible for civilian victims on both sides . I ca n't deceive myself and others by blaming Israel only because I am a muslim or an arab
ummjake , I am really surprised by your arguments trying to explain to your son things that he knows better than you . While I would pass on the Israeli vs Arab -LRB- Muslim -RRB- issue because it is contravertial , and I do n't want to be biase , I am stunned by your answers/arguments about Gays . Your son has the correct info , and I am certain you know that as well . Just your freek education and being politically correct prevent you from saying the truth . If you are a christian or a Jewsih , you know that the bible or old testement do not approve of this . If you do n't have a religion , you know that human nature does reject such a relationship . Your kid is being tought the correct things at school , while you are manipulating them ...
Why does it bother you -LRB- or anyone else really -RRB- what two consenting adults choose to do with their private romantic/sexual lives ? They 're not asking you to join in . Just be happy they have found someone to love and care for . And human nature does not reject such a relationships . Statistics show that 10 % of the population are homosexual . There 's even evidence of homosexuality being the norm in some parts of the animal kingdom . Do your homework ... My kid is n't being taught this in school . Trust me . If he were , I would yank him out of there so fast your head would spin . He 's hearing about it from the other kids in the neighborhood , who hear it from their parents , who subscribe to that notion because their religion dictates it and that 's what they 've been brought up on . If that lifestyle is not for you , then do n't follow it . Simple enough . Let everyone make their own choices about what works for them . Think you can handle that ?
First , thank you for taking the debate with a good spirit . By the way , currently , I live in US , and probably moving to Qatar inthe next 2-months or so . The two of us and the lady who started this thread are going through the same thing in a different spirit . While I am trying to move to Qatar to protect my kids form the type of education and tolerance the west promot -LRB- and obviously you do as well -RRB- , you are trying to protect your kids from the good morals that the society in QA breatch . I am an educated person with a PhD degree , and very open to tolerate many issues , but nothing againist the human nature or the order of God . While I was so accomodating to avoid the debate about Israel -LRB- I am an arab by the way -RRB- , I would not tolerate the Gays Lesbian issue . Good created us to Multiply , otherwise , if two men get married and two women get married , and the human raise will disappear . It is immoral issue , and disgusting behaviour . It is not a matter of why I am bothered by this , it is a matter of moral and religion belive . The three main relgion do disapprove of this . You know the story of the people of prophet Loat -LRB- sp ! -RRB- , how good punished them . The story is mentioned in the three holy books . I would certainly argue againist the animal kingdoom ? I have never read , heard , or seen that animals do practice this . Males animals always fight for feamales . Any culture and society has positives and negatives , and the smart person who try to improve on his qualities . I have been in NA for 18 years , and picked up many of the good qualities that are hear , such as educations , work ethics , honesty , dedications , tolearnce , objectivity , being profissional in all aspect of your life , time keeping , etc. . I hope you can be prave enough , and pick on some of the good ethics and morals down there in Qatar , beside the money ...
you 'll probably encounter gays in Doha more than any other place .
Well expressed , Ummjake . If my son came home spouting stuff about homosexuality being ` haram ' I would certainly object to it strongly too . The fact of homosexuality being found in the animal kingdom is indeed well documented . There are cases of ` gay ' animals being found in some colonies . It is -LRB- humourously -RRB- called the ` science that dares not speak its name ' . I do recall an interesting documentary on Showtime -LRB- the Arab world satellite network -RRB- about this not long ago . What this fact of nature indicates that it is not the ` unnatural ' behaviour moralists have always claimed it to be , since given a free reign , even animals engage in it naturally . Human - and animal - sexuality is so much more complex than just the ` man and woman . . they make baby ' narrative which religionists are have been using for centuries . And homosexuality being condemned in the Christianity and Judaism ? Hmm , you may want to check your facts on that one . Sure , the Vatican do n't like it , but there is a lot of scholarship to explain why the anti-gay interpretation gained traction over history - gained traction until it was considered a `` fact '' - but was , in fact , not correct . Understanding the nature of religion as a way of leveraging power over others really helps to explain why we follow its rituals and ideas with such dedication , even flying in the face of logic , science , or reason . ------------- `` let 's slip out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini '' Mae West
Only a man knows what a man needs ... fly the flag boys . you use my pole any day . .
Although i respect ummjack opinion . But i would never teach my son to accept gays . i 'll never teach him either to fear or reject them . It 's up to him to determine it himself . Both my parents share `` arab nationalist '' ideology.Yet , I 've never been taught to hate jews .
I always , always say there are good and bad in every race , religion and country . Respect has to be given to all . I am very old fashioned , my boys always stand up when ANY lady enters the room . They hold doors open for both men and women , simply because that shows respect and good manners to an adult . If an adult is rude to them after they have shown them respect , all I say is , they could have been having a bad day -LRB- whilst fuming -RRB- . My thoughts are my own , but I doubt my Mum would agree with some of them .
an article you may find informative . Written by the same journalist who so vehemently argued against the recent attempt to ban criticism of religions in the UN ; I only mention this as it further points out that nothing should be free from scrutiny and criticism - otherwise the carnage in Gaza could also be suppressed . http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-dupes-no-we-were-telling-the-truth-1649528.html <spanÂ style=font-style:Â italic> `` Deaths in the Bible .

I too agree that what read in the press or see on the ` news ' has to be taken with a pinch of salt . However , how do people learn ? I admit that people are travelling more and so they see for themselves but we have to read and then debate and then make our own conclusions . My thoughts are my own , but I doubt my Mum would agree with some of them .
Thanks all for a high quality debate . I think we can both learn from hearing the other side . I want to take up for the Israel argument from the perspective of another Arab -LRB- in this case Palestinian -RRB- who has lived over half his life in the US and England . Its true that in the middle east there is a culture of black and white . However , in the west , there is a CULTURE OF GRAY . In other words , there is a tendency to say both sides are at fault and there is no hard facts and no right and wrong . Sometimes this is true , but in my opinion often it allows one to have a lazy psuedo-intellectual opinion about a subject they know very little about . It takes knowledge to take a -LRB- fair -RRB- stand . There is little remaining grayness in the Israel Palestine issue . This is a situation where one people came and displaced another , and continue to abuse them for over 50 years . Israeli historians and most Israeli intellectuals agree with these facts . Look up Benny Morris and the new historians in Israel for the modern scholarly Israeli narrative for what happened in Palestine . Its not pretty . Israel is in defiance of nearly 100 UN resolutions , relating both to their land grab and human rights records . The closest analogy is the displacement of the native indians in north america -- I am sure it would sound shocking if you try to assign them some of the blame for the genocide they experienced . The other side tries to feebly resist , but are subjected to an overwhelming opression and injustice ; the closest anology to the current situation on the ground is aparthide in south africa . Nowadays , the Arab countries have made remarkable compromise articulated in the Saudi initiative more than 5 years ago . They are agreeing to complete normalization with Israel , in exchange for the west bank -LRB- 21 % of the area of the historical Palestine which had less than 5 % jews 100 years ago -RRB- . However , Israeli right wing , with the support of the Israeli lobbies the US -LRB- AIPAC and JDL and their cronies -RRB- insist on no compromise . Meanwhile , over 2 million Palestinians continue to live in subhuman conditions and the world continues to find `` both sides at blame '' because they will not agree to it . We live in strange times . I hope that you would instead encourage your kids to read and figure out the facts ; isnt that a great lesson ? I am a strong believer that with justice , comes peace , and the festering wounds that generate hate are dried up . I also sincerely hope that you invest a little more energy into learning about the middle east geo-political issues before assuming that you know about it than the people living it do .
it 's not about the conflict . . the question was : how to handle the question of 8 years-old boy about `` israelians killing Lebanese babies '' . You suggest studding israelian-palestin conflict and figuring out who is ` good ' and who is ` bad ' , which consequentially leads to accepting one side and judging another , which eventually leads to the stirring up the hatred . But thats NOT what the child needs . NOT to find out who is right and who is wrong , NOT to argue anymore when , who , and why ? Child needs to be explained that ANY killing is bad , ANY war is wrong . Child doesnt need to understand WHY one kills another . Child has to learn : any KILLING shouldnt be accepted in the civil world . I hope you can see the difference . <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed .

I completely agree and see the difference . I was not offering any advice about how to handle the situation of the original poster . I struggle with these issues with my own sons , who are 5 and 3 . I was attempting to generate an ADULT discussion similar to the one above on homosexuality . Cheers .
NOT tell their kids something they believe is true `` because it has not been well-researched '' ? -LRB- And who is deciding whether something is well-researched or not ? -RRB- Nobody would do that . I think the most open-minded of parents might try to explain both sides and then tell their kids that as they grow up and learn more , they will make up their own minds , but we will almost always explain what WE believe is true ... because when you believe something yourself , you generally think that you are right . That 's just human nature . I seriously doubt that the religious among us would tell their kids `` Well , mommy and I believe in one God , and that he created the heavens and the earth . But that 's just us . You should read up on the subject and find out what makes sense to you . '' LOL ! But would n't it be fun if they did ?
Kudos to you for teaching your children that what is taught and said in school is n't the gospel truth ! Children are confused enough as it is in life without being taught that certain nationalities , races , religions , sexual orientation , are the devil incarnate . Children 's minds are like blank blackboards ... they also absorb things like sponges . Why teach them hatred against others at such a young impressionable age when all they want to do is be friends with the next child , irregardless of who or where they are from ? Life is difficult enough to deal with , without presetting young minds upon a destructive path . If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous , he will not bite you ; that is the main difference between a dog and man . - Mark Twain -
If I am from the USA then I should have the same opinion as you ? I say clearly I am a Palestinian who has lived in the US over half his life . I am a US citizen . I am a long term lurker on qatarliving who registered to contribute to this conversation . I am a Professor in a US university on sabbatical leave for the year in Qatar -- what does this have to do with anything , anyways ? My response was intended to generate adult conversation . The crux of my argument is that many expats here do not understand the geopolitical situation in Israel/Palestine and assume instead that people here are irrational for having the opinion that they do about Israel . A peaceful and just resolution to the problem there is the only way to stop the hate ; that starts with understanding the facts on the ground , instead of having the PC opinion that there are no facts and everyone there is equally to blame . My response was not intended in any way to be something you say to your kids -- poor choice of thread on my part .
I completely agree with your sentiment and respect the way you are raising your kids . I apologize if my response came across as if I am being critical of you . I like the emphasis on growing up and learning more for issues that are too complex for them to handle ; I will use that line with my own kids if you dont mind . Peace -LRB- and justice ! -RRB-
and have no problem with your nationality , heritage or where you choose to live or work . I agree -- a lot of these issues present wonderful teaching moments if you 've got kids . But as parents we have to view them as such and be mindful of what we say , how we say it , and whether our actions match our words ... As Robert Fulghum said , `` Do n't worry that children never listen to you ; worry that they are always watching you . ''
Okabbar , welcome to Doha if indeed you decide to come . There is a lot of benefit to raising children here , especially kids from North America who have tended to see themselves as the center of the known universe ! But one caveat for you , I have known many parents with fine moral fiber get the shock of their lives when they tumble to the fact that their kids are mistreating their maids , shopkeepers or other laborers whom they happen to come in contact with . I 'm not saying everyone and I know that every parent says not my kid , but I 've known a lot of surprised and dismayed parents . Mandi
is still only a child , let him play , he will know the war only when it is bigger and you will see that the two parties is no different ... for hatred , there is always a time ...
http://yadiin.blogspot.com/ Sin is sin . You can call opposing sin politically incorrect - or propaganda . Unfortunately these kids are killed by the Israeli war machine . And it is not over . Most probably another ones will be killed . As a parent how you not feel that something is wrong with Israel 's policy ?

Thanks for the greetings . I do n't know how much you know about Canada and its culture and education . Canada and Canadian system is one of a kind when it comes to social integration , respecting others , and peaceful interactions . To make the story short , I have three boys -LRB- 10 , 7 , and 2 -RRB- , and they are so respectable to others and so peaceful . To a a degree , where I am a bit annoyed about it . I am struggling to teach my kids to be aggressive when there is a need for it . They always resort to peaceful ways in resovling any conflicts or aggression committed against them at school . The are so obedient to rules and polices . I want them to be street wise , and when things turns rough , they can handle it . So may be they will gain some of this by moving to Doha !! I hope you understand my point , I am not an agressive or agressor , but boys -LRB- future men -RRB- they need to be tought to stand up for themselves if there is a need for it . US culture is totally different , and it is more in the aggressive side compared to Canada . Currently I work in US -LRB- since June 08 -RRB- , but I did not move my family yet . I am in a cross road , where I need to decide once and for all if I am going to move to Arabic country or settle for ever in NA . Giving my kids the opportunity to be fluent in arabic and experince Islamic/Arabic culture and true religious feastivities have been playing in my mind for few years . It is vefry difficult to hear my kids speek arabic in a funny way/tone .
Wooo ... I guess the political and religious threads are the strongest magnets in this community . My answer to the original question ... I would tell my child that she ca n't hate a group of people based on what `` some '' of them do ... if your colleague at school is nice to you ... be more nice to her/him regardless of what her nationality or regligion is . If she buys you a gift on your birthday ... be sure to save her birthday date on your calender and do n't forget to buy her a great gift . Do not hate anyone unless you try and try and try and try to communicate your hurt to them ... tell them why you feel hurt by what they do and why their actions are keeping you from loving them . War is an ugly thing . No baby deserves to die in return for a woman who got killed by a bomber ... and vice versa . In the end , different people are influenced by the cultures they are raised in ... and from these cultures they conclude their own opinions about different topics in life ... war , sex , education , work , religion ... etc. . The best thing to do is to try to strip your mind off any biased ideas and prejedice against any group of people . Jews and Israelis are very much unwelcommed and hated in the middle east ... because people hear and see everyday from the media what Israelis do to their brothers and sisters . In the western communities ... muslims are also unwelcommed and hated ... because people there see and hear from the media what muslims do around the world . If you stand up for something ... you will have to prove you are right ... and you will have to suffer the consequences and responsibilities for your beleifes . In the end ... I would tell my daughter to refer to the Quran ... it explain best all what I ` have just said .

lol asif
a natural defense mechanism of the human body regardless of sex -LRB- male or female -RRB- ... although most men and women as well , thought of crying as a sign of weakness . saying `` only ladies cry . '' but for me a man who cries is a man who knows himself throughly ... he understands very well that crying is a natural reaction . . and doing such can not or will never diminish his sexuality or manliness . he only wants to feel better after every crying ... thus affirming his humanity . by the way , animals do n't cry ... they go on rage . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = When in Rome do as the Romans do !!!
Its true that animals dont cry , they only make cry :| <imgÂ src=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PP0eiWZjmgs/SYd-2AjBhDI/AAAAAAAAAJY/Tg8kV_ylMVs/s400/animal.jpg>
lolz yousri bro . . too much crying is bad for eyes
Mr M , come on ... shedding some tears is crying too !!! and it 's good to know that women are the cause lol ... listen to the sound of silence ...
it 's okay to cry ... Real men should not be afraid to cry ... Men who cry are confident with themselves that they are true men who are brave to accept their weakness ... who understand that breaking down or crying is not a sign of being sissies rather it is a natural human emotion that everyone has to go through . i have read somewhere that the percentage of breakdowns / suicides are higher in males than females ... females have the capacity to handle problems/situations because aside from friends and families who give them moral support , their tears give way to bottled up emotions ... once they have a good cry , they feel better and relieved .
Its healthy to cry to ease the pain .
why you always cry ? thats why you 're healthy ? Thank you and Best wishes ** Dont get discourage when things go beyond your imagination because the greatest glory in life is not falling but rising everytime you fall . Life is what you make it **

woman is more patient than man does am i right ? Thank you and Best wishes ** Dont get discourage when things go beyond your imagination because the greatest glory in life is not falling but rising everytime you fall . Life is what you make it **
A man should never cry like a woman , rather he should tackle his problems bravely , it 's not a manly thing , this crying , but untill unless he loses a loved one , then he would shed a few tears , and carry on .
i dont think so ... i disagree with that because no one on earth cries without any reason unless insane lol .

it is not okay to cry even for babies unless they hurt !!!!!!!!!!!!! . but for you it is okay cause you need it bad lol !
i do n't see any reason why not ... You wo n't fully enjoy a swing unless you raise your feet from the ground ... .
sure go ahead ... ... listen to the sound of silence ...
its ok . . if they r hurt they can cry . .
everyone cries no matter what . `` human emotions ' . ` coz others perception is that when a man cries that means weak , which i disagree . its no longer an issue i knw but still exists .

i have updated my s2 with ics 4.0.3 officially ! i got the download file from the hungary website of samsung , anyway it sucks ! there are lots of lags and it does n't even look like the ics in Galaxy nexus .

u both kidding right ?
make a list of your preferred parts , bring it to sofitel for a price qoute at least 3 shops , then compare it online .
i want a computer that will run Crysis 2 smoothly . do u think i can get high-end parts in sofitel ?
I would not trust the Sofitel one bit . Fine for cheap cheap junk but not high end computer gear . I 'd also like to get a gaming rig . 2 options I 've seen are an Alienware M15X laptop at Jarir Bookstore and PC One on Salwa Road will import and Alienware machine for you if you take a print out of the specs to them .
There a shop <b> facing Sofitel </b> that stocks some good parts -LRB- Outside - do n't remember the name , but it 's the only one -RRB- .

@ Absolutejaguar . PC One . haa . i 've seen that place before . but what did you mean import an Alienware machine for me . ca n't they assemble one for me with the same specs and configurations . if they import it for me . what if there 's any mistake ,
PC One do n't carry enough components , you spec the machine on the Alienware site , then take that spec to the . They arrange to import of the machine from states , shipping , customes etc. . The shop outside the Sofitel that bleu might be refering to is around the back , away from the main road , Gigabyte I think , and that is the brand they stock , had a lot of over priced liquid cooled cases last time I looked .

Yes you do need it I am afraid , unless your work for any government department . .
Of course you can bring it but beware ! A new car bought in UAE will probably not be serviced by the main dealer here under warranty . A friend tried to import an old car and they would n't let it in , cost almost 100,000 QR in port charges , before it was resolved . You have the added complication of driving through Saudi if coming overland . Check everything before you try this .
Hey Johnboy , Is that true ? Five years old ? I was told it is now 3 years old . I have a similar problem . I want to import my car ; however , it is 5 years old .
HI I THINK POEPLE ARE GAUDING U WRONG . UPON MY INFORMATION IF THE PERSON IS ALREADY IN UAE AND HE MIGRATE ON NEW VISA -LRB- WORK PERMET -RRB- AND HE WANA BROUGHT HIS CAR ALONG WITH HIM . SO I THINK WITHOUT ANY COST HE WILL BRING IT . BECAUSE I BEEN IN SAUDI ONCE FOR PURPOSE OF UMMRA OVER THERE , AND MY COUSINE IS IN RIYADH SO HE WANA BUY MY CAR . SO WHEN I BACK TO DOHA , I ASK ON MY SOURCES SO I GOT THAT I M NOT ABLE .
I want that , too .
OHHH . . GEE . . NOT AGAIN ! : -RRB-
Always heard about that black oil . . but nobody can tell where to find and buy some . Better switch to pure high grade honey and it 's good to our health . . they are available at villagio , but so expensive !
Huh not again :-LRB- -LRB- Dracy likes only Garlic oil : P
Please give us a shout when you find it .
black seeds are available in dry fruit shops in souk waqif you ask them if they keep oil too .
you can find in Almeera , family food center , Al safeer , Indian Supermarket , Irani Market -LRB- Souq wagif -RRB- , Retail Mart , Shopirte . I hope this would help you .
My husband has been using it . . it has medicinal benefits didnot know before he had his angioplasty ... it has to be taken in the morning 1 table spoon around 15 ml and is available at the Al Safeer Shopping Centre ...
I think the Sudanese sell the black cum seeds but I have never heard it curing any diseases ...
It works , ES . But you have to believe in it .
You 're dirty Xena , the Saffers are next on my satrical hitlist ... you need some Sudanese man juice to cure you of your animal fetish ...
well i never knew its medical benefits ... once u find it pls inform us also ...
You can find it in AL MEERA and will cost you arround 20QR .
Who cares . . its raining in manila and dry out here . . a few drops of water dont make much of a difference

Oh my , did n't think of that . Surely 2 hours is way too much time to spend on buying a car .
you have to pay atleast 10,000 qr more if you buy car over loan . the loan also depends on you salary . the bank will cut min . 1500qr per month and that also depends on how many years you want to pay loan , 3/5 . better contact with any showroom person .
Car loan rates are usually `` Flat '' the average/normal bank rates are between 4.5 to 6 % -LRB- promos excluded -RRB- So if you are buying a car -LRB- eg . CRV - QAR .100,000 / - -RRB- on a 5 year loan @ 5 % ; add 2.5 % - 3 % Processing fee + 25 % interest + first year insurance say 5 % ... your total to pay bank is 100,000 +2500 +25000 +5000 i.e. , 132,000 therefore monthly instalment would be 132,000 / 60 = QAR .2,208 / - and it could vary slightly depending on the grace period you choose or bank offers for the first repayment . You can get the same terms from car dealer 's inhouse financing -LRB- if bankloan doesnt work -RRB- but the rate could be 7.5-8 .5 % Good luck
cant he just pickup a phone and call the relevant agencies and get the rates ? That wouldnt take up much time isnt it ?
thanks express for the info ... so just in case i am changing my job b4 5ys , do i need 2 pay the entire amount to the bank b4 joining a new company ???
No , you can change jobs within qatar , your new company will provide a letter so you can keep the loan at repayment agreed originally . I am leaving Qatar soon and am going to transfer the bank loan I have for my car to the next buyer as long as they are eligable for the loan . You can do this no problem . I have a Toureg V8 if you are interested : -RRB-

no problem at all ... you just have to present an ownership id if and when the police requires you to do so ... just be safe and prevent accidents
I too am interested in this . If my friend lends me his car and I have a valid licence , does his car insurance automatically cover me to drive ? In the UK cars are insured under the name of the driver and if you want anyone else to drive it you have to put their name on the policy . Is that the same here ?
As far as I understand it , it is the car that is insured not the driver . so as long as you have a valid driving licence , Qatari or otherwise you are insured to drive the vehicle .
YES , no problem you can drive other people 's car anytime as long as you did not hit something or worst someone . Cheers ,
Try Sharq also . . they do provide romantic dinners packages ...
If price is not an issue , take him to the ISS -LRB- International Space Station -RRB- !
Sharq doesnt look modern
Imagine making love without gravity . Every push let 's you fly .
Zaoq ... :-RRB- anyway make ur first choice the last , i mean ` W'hotel . Its good .
Take to all those 4 hotels you mentioned .
I can tak him to hardees but there is no bed there
and why do u need a bed ? : -LRB-
so we can make love
oh ok ! Ur house bedroom isnt sufficient ? :-RRB- -LRB- JK -RRB-
Yes you need something with a close sea view . You should try al Sharq . I think it is very romantic . They give you those rooms like little homes , nice sea view and great pools . . If you want to party , it is not the place . W is my fav in terms of service , but it does not fall under the romantic category . 4 seasons sucks . Looks good from far but is far from good . Grand Hayat is OK , it 's got a bit of everything you might need . I 'd still go to Sharq if I am to impress someone and be super romantic tho .
This hotel just opened last sept. . you can take a romantic walk down corniche after your dinner . If you request special pampering or surprise for your dear the staff might be willing to help you since they 're newly opened and would likely accomodate their customers wishes ... ;--RRB- http://doha.frasershospitality.com/
RitzCarlton , would be the best option between the hotels in your mind . .
btw there is a new hotel in Doha , named Doha Torch in aspire . . didnt try , but seems very interesting . .
Two weeks ago I went to see a friendly match near Khalifa Stadium . I passed by a hotel which looks like Hotel de Ville in Paris , illuminated with lights at night . I guess it is really romantic .

That ' s very true
You 're a prisioner as soon as you get your RP , I believe .
yes you can go . if your company is doing online exit they can . ID is required only for cancellation .
Im not sure what u asks for . but if u see in your passport there 's sticker with Qatar logo and your photo , its mean u can go and boarding in airport . and of course your sponsor already put in exit permit for you in MOI that allow u go outside qatar . Qatar ID card is not required at all for going out from qatar . hope this help u
Please note that i donot have sticket on my passport
now Im totally black-out . now you dont have sticker that is your resident permit in any paper in your passport , its yours sponsor have big problem with MOI . big penalty waiting for your sponsor and not you . Sponsor must and their responsible max one month to put all formality resident permit . now tell your sponsor .
better ask the authorities . a friend of mine was issued a residence permit about 3 weeks back , he has the ID , and he got exit permit from his company . all was set for a planned trip to dubai , but , was he aghast when the airline would not let him board . apparently your visa needs to be at least 6 months old before you are granted exit . well , at least to GCC , though im not very sure , perhaps to home country is fine . but otherwise , i think you 're in detention . should be worth it to check with the right people just to save you the hassle .
Check in the LULU and FFC ...
check inorbit mall mumbai , the forum bangalore , bay pride mall kochin , spencer plaza chennai etc. . . i am sure you will get it . . lol . . : -RRB-

6000-6500 sounds about typical . 7000 if you are lucky .
Fairmae , there is no income tax in Qatar so your salary is not low !
why do people always ask how much is the salary range for this or that ? do n't they know how much salary they deserve ? if an engineer with 5 yrs exp is earning 20,000 / month , you being a newcomer should demand the same then ? i do n't know i think it is just weird : p
QR6500 / - per month
there are no taxes in Qatar .

scholar academy is very good . . on E ring road . Call 44630675 for more info .
It is now located in abu hammour . At the back of Woqod Oil Depot .
Inspection centre had been shifted from there . . near to Waqod Petrol station on abu hamour road ... Directions : If you are coming from Ramada to Decoration round about , turn left and go st8 and str8 unless you find waqod petrol station on your left hand side then turn left go str8 take u turn and come back then u will see some big oil tanks , take service road and turn right and you will reach there ...
no more near LULU , it has moved to Abu Hamour
Just call the Main Technical Inspection located at Industrial Area and ask them the same question , you will get the right answer .
there is a map of the locations , including abu hamour at http://www.fahes.com/ you really ca n't miss it - there is a long wide road just before the woqod tanks - it 's at the end of the road . i went a couple of weeks ago , was there at 6:00 am - was done by 7:10 .
I believe you can inspect your car in any Woqod petrol stations .
go for d90 if you 've got the budget
d60 is just fine ... been using nikon since day one and im very much happy with it , i have a friend however who owns a canon and very much happy with it too ... i guess it 's the person behind the camera that matters and not the camera itself ...
u can buy . but wat aobut rates
Carrefour is cheaper & if u have enough money to dispense , say 5 + thousand or so try the nikon d90.it can shoot HD video as well
go to carrefour , there 's plenty there ... which one you looking for point & shoot or DSLR ?
As nomad said , you could check out carrefour for that . Or you could also take a look at Salam plaza , the one near City centre . They 've got Nikon -LRB- & Canon -RRB- stuffs there , bags and filters too , but the items sell at a pretty high price there . And , theres this small shop near Jumbo electronics at the Sofitel area , it 's called Photo Gulf , theyve got some nikon stuff there too , good thing is you can ask for discount ;-RRB- sort of . Hope you find what you 're looking for ! Good day . Live . Learn . Love .
try carrefour or in virgin . . nikon is good dslr cam . . i have my nikon d40 and its good for a starter in photography like myself . . lolz
salam Plaza is the best dealer for Nikon . They got all models from the amateur Cameras to the Nikon D3
Whats your budget ? Nikon D40 is a steal right now , since the arrival of D60 and now D90 .
I think this would be legal .

You can get DVI to HDMI any where I have seen in lulu d ring . Not sure about VGA to HDMI
how many do you need ? I 'll ask my techie friend if he have one .
Do n't think you will get a VGA to HDMI Cable . You would need an adapter to convert the signals . VGA is analogous signal and HDMI is digital . I have n't seen a direct VGA to HDMI adapter around here . You can always get a VGA to DVI Adapter from any computer shop and DVI to HDMI Cable from any electronics shop . But be aware that this will only give you a video signal , no audio .
you can check carrefour or technical care center . . both in city center mall

Yes - If you apply within 3 months of departure , you will get this status . It happened to our family friend whose wife left in June and when he again applied for visit visa in August .
Hemlata : Then what happened ? Did he finally get the visa after he explained ?
You can have Visa if you have all this requirements . 1 , house or apartment most in your name contract 2,10,000 QAR salary 3,6 month financial record is a bank statement if you dont have this all papers dont waste you time to apply your application will failed Be careful some mandop is n't honest .
No . They refused . He submitted application after 3 months and got it
Did you visit Immigration department today regarding you family visa status Mentioning `` POSTPONED ''
Yes . They need a salary letter from my company which should have a breakdown of the basic salary and other allowances . The one that i submitted only mentioned the total salary and did not give a breakdown .
I visited immigration department today for my issue postponed . He ask me to get attested on my marriage certificate in Ministry of external Affairs department QATAR.i had got attested already in Qatar ministry of external affairs department in India .

you can not bring your baby to Qatar without a visa even if he/she is just one day old only . end of discussion .
Hello , I am in same situation as you are . Our company PRO told me that the infant can arrive in Qatar without visa until 90 days -LRB- may be visa on arrival for infant - provided both Parents should have valid visas for Qatar -RRB- . My family will be arriving by Emirates . I can book the infants flight ticket without visa . I hope there wont be any problem at Doha Airport , on arrival .

Thank you so much s_isale . So , all I have to do is just apply for the extension of his visit visa at the immigration ? Thanks again .
no need for the medical exam for infants , just pay 100 QAR and finish ...
u have to pay 100 QR at the medical commision , u dont need to take the child there
shinning , but you need to go to medical office for doctor signature on that form .
You still need to go to medical commission and get the form filled and pay at the counter . There they would just mention that infant is here with mother and that 's it . No medical tests are performed .
Thanks a lot for everyone for their guidance . I really really appreciate that . You guys are awesome !!!
To baldrick ... Boss read the question before you answer ... Your profile is saying you are a manager ... Good luck to your employer . .
You ca n't drive in Egypt with your Qatari Driving Liciense . You need to first get an International Driving License here in Qatar and then you can drive there in Egypt with your International Driving License .
You can not drive in Egypt with your Qatari D/L , You must obtain Egyptian D/L first . Have a nice journey
I beleive you can still take a Interntaional Drivers Lic ense from Qatar for the time being . . : -RRB-
Qatar Driving License General Qatari residents must carry a valid Qatari driving licence . GGC State Nationals are permitted to use their National Driving Licenses . As a visitor -LRB- other nationals -RRB- to Qatar , your national driving licence is acceptable for seven days from your date of arrival in the country . If you wish to rent a car for longer than the seven days -LRB- but do not intend to take up permanent residence -RRB- you will require a temporary driving license . If you are keen to drive during your first few months in Qatar , it is worth obtaining an International Licence before you get here . An International Driving License is valid for 6 months from the date of your arrival in Qatar . Getting a driving license depends on what country you are from . Citizens from most western countries such as Canada and the U.K. can change their drving licenses for Qatari ones . Other nationalities have to do a driving test which is actually quite difficult . In most cases the procedure for issuing a local licence just includes an eye test and a simple written test . However , it is necessary to hold a residence permit in order to apply for a Qatari driving licence . The Procedure Temporary Driving License The following items are required for a Temporary Driver 's license -LRB- TDL -RRB- : a -RRB- Original drivers license from home country . b -RRB- Eye examination . c -RRB- Process fees QR156 -LRB- about $ 45 -RRB- . d -RRB- Four personal photos -LRB- with eye glasses , if required -RRB- . e -RRB- Copy of Passport An appointment for the eye examination will be set up for you by the HR Department and you will be informed of the time and date for the appointment . Permanent Drivers License Converting the Temporary Driver 's License to a Permanent Driver 's License requires the following : a -RRB- Temporary Drivers License -LRB- TDL -RRB- . b -RRB- Two photos . c -RRB- Copy of Passport and Residence Permit . d -RRB- Process fees of QR156 -LRB- about $ 45 -RRB- .

for the driving directions - is it open for sure ?
yes but you have to make an account on the pc and choose the correct country , for me i 'm using france as country . second thing you have to open the nat port on qtel router .

Yes , as above . Or set up a vpn .

I think yes because white color absorb less heat !!
atleast want to believe that it 's one way of preventing accident with other vehicle since white is very visible .
And with all the dust/sand , it does n't show as much as it would on a darker colour
1 . Agreed that White reflects heat , but I doubt that it will do much effect on the car as the body is metal and its a conductor . 2 . Dust does n't show much on a white car . 3 . Easier to touch up white than any other shade of a color . 4 . It has evolved into a choice now . People just go for white cars ! I went to one showroom once and they said they order for 50 % white cars and the rest 50 % other colors .
there are much reasons about it . first one is that arabic peoples like white color ... 2nd is about heat . . 3rd dust . . and so on
WHITE is coooooooooooooooooool in Cars buddy ? AInt it ???
BECOZ `` WHITE THE BEST ''
White is cool , looks good easy on cleaning always looks new with less manintaince.safe in night even from long distance so Natuarally people prefer white.May be your first car here will be white too : -RRB-
sleeping bags that you buy here wont work there coz its winter season in the himalayan region and you need small , and light sleeping bags that can withstand temperatures upto -10 degree celcius or more .
I bought a back pack from Souq Asiri for 180 riyals . Held everything that I needed . Bought a sleeping bag from City Centre for 65QR and the moment I used it , I started regretting my decision . I was still dead freezing . I am paralysed from one lower limb , so I had to carry what I was able to carry and most of the time the stuff I took with me thinking that I might need it sometime later on was not even used . So the next time I go , I will just take myself and some extra cash with me as everything is available wherever you go . I went to Pakistan to the Karakoram and crossed over to China . The best trip of my life and I will be going back again . Visit Hunza in Pakistan and Karakul Lake in China when you go there and make your way to east to Tibet . Its amazing .
I do not remember the name exactly but there is a shop at 3rd floor I think . You can find pants , bags , shoes and such stuff there . They sell nice stuff like Columbia , Titanium , etc. . but its hard to find sizes sometimes . The shop is beside Timberland . `` What does n't kill me ; makes me stronger ... ''
I doubt you will find what are you looking for . Sleeping bags are available but you might need to have at least 3 season for winter hike . Trekking sticks and some good stuff is available in the new sports shop in Villagio , near food courts . Expensive shop but some good stuff is there . If you are not able to find good clothing , go with the layers . The best thing -LRB- if you can find -RRB- is breathable wind breaker/rain jacket .

I attended the OD here in pinas but WAAAAAH they did n't call me for assessment ...
Thanks fRanCisM and CHEF_MACKY for your help . Sorry I did not response for the past week bec . I ready myself for the OD .
HR is not just HR . It is a strategy . Apply , and keep on applying . Do not be disappointed by rejection , they look for specific characters . It is very likely they will reject you 2 to 3 times before even considering you . When going , dress business . Dress like a hostess , make-up and the whole ten yards . Speech , take a part-time job in a call center . They will teach you how to speak English , and in due time you 'll loose your accent -LRB- if you have one -RRB- . Lastly , do not focus on one airliner only . Good luck .
Yeah Dude was right , character is the main factor in your field , just recently 1 crew was commended for a WOW service . Develop your character , you will not only present our country but the Qatar as well , when you 'll become part of the their team , remember you will be dealing with various kinds of nationalities . Cheer Up ! This is not the end . . <em> <aÂ href=http://www.qatarliving.com/node/535563> `` Letting go to know the truth . . Is not so hard to do '' </a> </em>

it was in the news a couple of weeks back . No news updates whether it was lifted or not .
The ban previously was for housemaid visa . It is a personal type of visa . Business and visiting visas are not included . Good Luck .
ok thanks for the info , ok i will check it tomorrow to the agency so that i can more clarify it . ok ill wait till national day . for sure they will open it ?
no ban . this is rumors . take a letter from your work and head to immigration . there is no ban even for maids . the point is that qatari offices stopped bringing maids from philippines because people is boyacatting and do not agree to pay 400 $ as a salary for maids
There 's one at # 42 I think , right at the top end near the roundabout before the road closure . It 's on the side heading into town . It says German on the front sign .
Thanx Tallq , can you describe route from Ramada signal . Thanx
From Ramada signal head out of town on Salwa Road -LRB- i.e. you head out past Jarir book store on your right -RRB- . Keep going and going and going until you get to the roundabout where you have no choice but to u-turn because the road ahead is closed . After you 've u-turned the German place is on the right hand side . Just pull in off the main road and drive along until you find it .
I KNOW HE MEANS GOOD BUT HE GOT YOU LOST THERE ALL WHAT HE SAID IS OK UP TILL THAT U TURN , SO MAKE THE U TURN THEN PASS THE ROUNDABOUT HEADING TO RAMADA AGAIN AND ON THE SECOND ENTRANCE ON YOUR RIGHT HAND SIDE WHERE THEY CALL A SERVICE ROAD YOU SHOULD INTER , YOU WILL KNOW YOU ARE IN THE CORRECT PLACE WHEN YOU SEE A BIG SIGN SAYS GREAT WALL 3 SHOPS AFTER THIS GREAT WALL CHINESE CAR DEALER YOU CAN GET TO GERMAN INSPECTION SHOP , CAR INSPECTION IS 200-250 SUV IS 250-300 BARGAIN ITS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
Thanx for guidin me , whats the exact name for this shop ? is it german inspection shop or something else ?

yap nissan sunny 2001 price 19000Qr
Yes , you are right !! Nissan have better resale than Kia
Well , i would go for neither of them , as both of those companies have low resale values . It is true that Nissan has higher resale value than Kia , but both of them have low . As someone said , that a car does n't matter as long as you like it , but you also need to look after the resale value . The two companies with the highest resale value are Honda and Toyota . I would recommend these 2 out of all .
omega.chri.bas . did you get your passport on that same day ... ?
yeah , even for photo copying , u have to pay for it too .
thanks for clearing that up ... so it 's including the renewal fee ... would 've been outrageous if it was for the photo alone ... now that would be a total rip-off ! : P
or the machine-readable passport ?
the MRP before is 200 QAR for renewal but you need to provide your own photos . With e-Passport , the photo is digitally taken at the embassy itself and they added 40 QAR so now , it 's 240 QAR . But before going to the embassy , better to have your old passport photocopied as photocopying there is a bit more expensive than outside . Lol !
Sorry to confused you , Qr 240 includes the renewal fee and digital photo .

it 's your genes - live with it .
It 's a symbol of wealth : -RRB-
then leave qatar
it 's not always your genes . some people experience temporary , reversible hair loss when they move here . probably due to the hard water .
Yea it is common , come stand next to me ... : -LRB-
who can tell him better than you ... ... ... : -RRB-
Yes it is a common problem with the water here , see a doctor
doctors here are themselves bald ... lols
Shave ur head if it suits ur head profile . . no other way to stop hair loss !!
started using bottled drinking water to wash my hair . lets see if this help to stop losing ! almost can see my scalp in the mirror getting worst .
check if your bottled water has added flouride . most probably it has . use masafi from the emirates . i would suggest evian , with a weekly dose of budweiser or corona beer as conditioner -LRB- because it 's not fit for human consumption anyway -RRB-
my mom used to tell me , we need to store water for atleast 2 hrs before using it on hair . Am trying now . I can see the change . Hair may not grown , but falling off has reduced ... u cn try it ... :-RRB- ... and hv heard d same from a beautician who ws interviewd in TV ... so i guess thats one way ...
Did you ever get chect your Vit D , Iodine and Magnesium level . You will be deficient in them . If you are Iodine deficient your TSH maybe elevated which also causes hair loss .

ACCA , CFA , CPA , CAT . . or some local degree like B.com etc. . .
Chartered Accountants ACCA - visit www.accaglobal.com , he can write exams via British Council . or CIMA globally recognised professional management accounting qualification . visit www.cimaglobal.com / or Distance Undergraduate Courses from various Int universities or There are lot of undergraduate courses like B.com / BBA in various institutions in Qatr .
Let him take bachelor degree first . That is the basement for any professional certificate . I will suggest B.Com . After that he can try for CMA -LRB- Certified Management Accountant -RRB- , which has great value across the world . Also he can try for CIA -LRB- Certified Internal Auditor -RRB- . . Then CFA , CPA etc. . Here is the address for CMA center in Doha INFOCENTER TRAINING & CONSULTING Ras Abu Aboud Road , Old Alghanim Area DOHA PO BOX 24855 PH : 974Â 444Â 4497 ACCA also another choice .

the gps should be able to give ur position almost properly but dont rely on the maps cause the maps are n't updated usually . . beta be careful otherwise u will land up on some closed road if u are following gps : P
try this app . Sygic . . Google it . . or youtube it . .
GPS works exceptionally well in Desert countries like the Gulf as there is very less tree cover . Desert Storm was a GPS war ... lol You can not lose your way even in low visiblity times like sand stroms etc. . While in places with very dense tree cover , GPS signal is interrupted ... its definitely a problem in Kerala ... because of so much Coconut and other tree cover . GPS war would prove ineffective there ... lol Most of the phones have 2 modes of connection : 1 . Assisted GPS Will use cell site to connect , quick connect , but it has charges . This is usless in places where there is no cell-site like sealine ... etc. . I suggest to switch it off unless you literally can not get a GPS signal even after 15minutes . 2 . Integrated GPS Uses the true satellite signal to connect . It takes about 1 to 3 minutes to find a minimum of 3 satellites , depending on where you stand . It can not function without reaching 3 or 4 satellites . Advantages of Phones over stand alone SAT NAV units are : 1 . You carry the phone everywhere ... chances of forgeting it are next to zero . 2 . You can send your coordinates as MMS so someone comming to meet you in a remote place ... say you are meeting a group in the desert . 3 . Convenience ... It has everything in a single unit ... especially the camera . 4 . Its dirt cheap if you split the cost as below : -LRB- a -RRB- Phone , -LRB- b -RRB- Camera , -LRB- c -RRB- music/video player -LRB- d -RRB- camera -LRB- e -RRB- GPS <b> Best GPS Mobile is Samsung Omnia QR 1850 </b> -LRB- Carrefour -RRB- 8GB card , 5MP camera , Excellent WIFI , due to Windows OS , Touch Screen , Garmin XT Mobile GPS software ,
Does any cne know about shary qtel cost of ramadan offers ?
I have an Iphone 3GS . Both the GPS and Maps are just fine . I can pinpoint my location even inside the office .
C'mon guys ! Comment on something that is useful . @jailbroken114 , for you it works perfectly because your 're connected to your office 's Wireless network , so the iphone can download the maps live from the net . Give it a try and go to Mesaeed in the desert and you will see that you will still have GPS -LRB- free all over the world - GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM -RRB- signal but no map . So , how can you navigate back to safety during a sand storm for example . Nor QTEL or Vodafone offer 3G support for iPhone , hence you have no internet , hence you have no map . HENCE - You ca n't call that navigation , right ?
My experience is excellent using Cygic and Google Maps and the built in Maps app preloaded into the iphone . Tried it and tested it to work perfectly with Cygic you do n't need the internet connection . to pre register from my 1st hand experience .
Yup i think it would work fine anywhere , even in the loo . But it wo n't be able to determine the exact precise location of yours , maybe within a few 100 metres would do . `` Everything is okay in the end , if it 's not ok , then it 's not the end . '' `` When one door closes , another opens ; but we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one that has opened for us . ''
I found out a great solution . . alternative to Tom Tom and Garmin . . workz with charm in my iphone 3g much beter and with routing and turn by turn voice help . . much much better than Garmin . . Checkout my post on the Forum topic in Section `` Advice and Help '' . .
YES ...
It 's safer than Australia for both men and women . There are lots of kindergartens , just do n't procrastinate finding one and getting acceptance . And yes , be prepared to be stared at constantly . Either just stare back or ignore it .
IN THE MIDDLE EAST THIS IS THE SAFEST PLACE AND VOID OF ANY PUBLIC INDECENCY AS IN DUBAI OR BAHARAIN .
do n't worry , this is a safe country ... being stared constantly is just a normal thing here . also , better to have a car when you 're here than commuting ... not only to avoid the stares but also the B.O of other passengers :-LRB- ewwwwww !!!!
Women stare just as much as men , particularly at Western people . Apart from the rudeness I encounter from other women occasionally , and the competition to have had the most babies , I do n't find living here a problem .
It is safe but I was a working mum and I found these diffciulties ... I had a business visa and could not sponsor a nnanny therefore I was left with maids who had company visas and or were illegal or not experienced but immediately looking foir the next jobs . I tested three but found none to satisfactory - my children were 2 and 4 so I kept them home as the fees for school a driver and the time the kids would have to get up were crazy I had a one hour commute each way so my days was wasted driving not with my kids . The nearest park to my home could be reached by car only , and the traffic sometimes made it a two hour exercise just in driving . The hospitals were OK but the public ones were accessible for appointments during work hours and the private ones expensive . I had a contract that allowed no unpaid leave and had penalties for missed work even if your kids were sick . Needless to say when my husabnd wanted to return home and resume his work and I had been unable to hire help and my son had an epileptic seizure - i gave notice and came home . As an expatriate worker with family I have found much friendly countries to work in where larger percentages of your pay stay with you and are not absorbed by high rents school fees and food prices . You need a good salary if you want to do all you want . in your contract get a vila provided and education for kids and a vihicle rent allowance and you can have an OK expat lifestyle . It depends on your salary - a labourer might be conned into coming for 280 Riyal a month - god knows how they survive . I got 14,000 + and I decided I was better taking 40,000 aud per annum salary cut and working somewhere costs were cheaper and lifestyle more family friendly I still do n't have a job but I am very happy with my decision to prioritse my kids and leave Qatar for the Qataris - mostly I found people with families where the women or both parents worked less then satisfied with the cost access to care and quality of care for their kids - People on huge salaries who can afford to join the intercontinental beach club and the wife and kids spent every after schoool moment there seemed satisfied - live in a compound with play facilities and you may be OK . Good luck .

Try with your company if they can sponsor them until you get your RP . .
Best way , just wait for your RP , do n't be hurry before that , for all reasons it will be the best solution ... Al the best .
try going to travel agents . . they can do something . . or go to the hotels . . in the hotels , tourist visa is 200QR but the problem you have to check-in for about two to three nights . . i did that last time , when my wife came here ... quite costly though . .
one year is enough for NAQL KAFALA -LRB- sponsorship change -RRB-
Sponshorship change does n't matter if its 1 or 2 years . Coz if your current sponsor/employer wo n't give you an NOC -LRB- No Objection Certification -RRB- , you ca n't change sponsorship ... UNLESS it 'll a transfer to a family/husband/wife visa .
Thank you for the input . I have some clarity now . There were contradictory views when I checked ; some said for the first transfer one has to wait for 2 years with first sponspor even if he gives NOC , some said one year is fine provided NOC is there etc. . Thanks again
hi fairdeal ? ANy updates ? did you manage to change sponsor ?? we have same situation now . .
Its great that you have NOC . You can transfer your sponsorship after one year .
normally it 's 2 years . Could be 1 , in certain circumstances and on the exceptional bases .
The rule is you have to have been with your first sponsor for 2 yrs before you can transfer to another and that too only if you get an NOC . If the employer for some reason does give u an NOC before the 2 yr period is over you still can not trf your sponsor to a new guy cuz the immigration will not accept . so for such cases you will be working as a ` borrowed ' employee till you complete the 2 yrs . we just faced this situ in our office
Tinker ... I changed my sponsorship from my first sponsor right after one year . There were no special circumstances involved , so I suppose , its one year . Two years ban is mostly for those whose visa has been cancelled .
Khattak - was this recently ? cuz this happend for us just abt 3 months ago . the guy is a Lebanese . so we now have another 3 months to go before he can change over to us .
Khattak - u r rite about that . no one knows when rules change in this part of the world .

anything that has a word GUN is banned and you are talking about carrying something that not only has the word GUN , but also explodes and makes noice and is bound to go wrong without notice . I do n't know if there is any charge , but yes there is a spring that makes noice and can create panic if explodes .
No . Even if it is a plastic toy , They will not allow . I had similar experience .
Not allowed even in hold baggage . Do n't even try , unless you want to miss your flight . Remember you have to answer a declaration when you check in , any false statements lead to arrest -LRB- always ! -RRB-

Goto German embassy and get Chengen visa & enjoy 14/15 countries for six months
Nationality : India So there is no requirement to stay/arrive in the country from whose embassy we take schengen visa ? If yes , then thats great news .
HI . I 'm also applying for Schengen Visa right now and we have the same issue . During the past 3 years I always have to send my documents to Swiss Embassy in Kuwait but since Oct 1 , 2012 , they implemented VIS which requires personal appearance so they can take your biometric data which will be valid for 5 years . I called the embassy if there is no other alternative than going to Kuwait and i was told none . so i decided to change my itinerary and go to Germany first so I can apply in German embassy instead . Tips . You have to show them that your point of entry is Germany and/or you will spend most of your stay in Germany . -LRB- tickets and hotel bookings as proof -RRB- . Goodluck !

The Royal Bintang , which one ? In Bukit Bintang ? Or the one at the Curve ? Bukit Bintang area is great to walk about and snap shots . If you 've been to KL before , then you 'd know . Careful of the `` working ladies '' around some of the pubs - enforcement not as strict as Qatar : -0 Renaissance Melaka - nice . Evergreen Laurel in Penang - not sure but think should be fine . Penang Island is very nice . Japamala Resort in Tioman - this one , my pals said is really very nice . Langkawi is also very nice , maybe better as on the west coast and away from the monsoon side . Duty free alcohol too . / Are you sure you do n't want to change venue ? The accommodation may be cheap for an expensive resort like that but if it 's raining all the time and seas are rough , do n't think you can go diving or snorkeling even . Best timing for East Coast of Malaysia is March to October or early Nov. before monsoon season starts . ***************************************** Do n't want no drama , No , no drama , no , no , no , no drama

why do n't you go to the Bahamas ! I am THE PRODIGY
Try Al Khor for a change .
If i were you i will use KL as a base ... So KL - Penang - KL , then KL - Tioman - KL . Which way you want to do them first doesnt matter . I am not sure if you can fly from Penang direct to Tioman ... but worth to check with Berjaya Air . Penang should be fine for 1 week ... make sure you visit Kek Lok Si Temple and take alot of photos . I dont know what is your liking ... but me think a week in Tioman might be a bit too long ? Except if you like diving they have a beautiful diving spots in Tioman . You need to go to Subang Airport ... to go to Tioman and book a flight with Berjaya Air . Make sure when you tell the taxi you want Subang Aiport not Kuala Lumpur International Airport .
Also google Melaka , quite interesting place to walk around ... especially the chinatown and its redsquare ...
My pals and I believe Tioman 's fine for a non-diving holiday too . But December should be right smack in the middle of the monsoon season which hits the east coast of Malaysia -LRB- Nov to Feb/March . But there 's the Monsoon Cup - 3-7 December 08 if you can make it and take some nice shots . As for Penang and Malacca - yes , you should go esp . if you 're a photographer . I dunno but I 'm assuming you are . The sights and colours would be very interesting indeed . East Malaysia is also beautiful but not sure if you can fit all that in . Mt. Kinabalu , the highest peak in South East Asia & a World Heritage Site , Maliau Basin Conservation Area , Mulu Caves , etc. . There 're so many things to see . ***************************************** Life is short . Live it to the fullest !

At blue/bleu salon .
Just got my new Nespresso machine today and bought it at Blue Salon on C Ring road , after La Cigale on the same side if you go from Ramada signal . Every flavour available at 24 Riyals for 10 pieces . Am in heaven !
<P> Thanks everyone - new in Doha so even trying to figure out what above means , but will get there with a map ... </P>
If you google Blue Salon in Doha you will find a map with GPS coordinates too . The GPS was the best purchase I made when I arrived and I highly recommend you to buy a Garmin .
<p> </p> <p> You can order Nespresso Capsules Through the phone , their toll free number is 8000888 </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>
@alumnar - what brand did you bought ? and how much is it ?
Just bring your stuff , it will work either within the ` European ' sockets or you get adadpters .
3 pin plugs will work in Qatar no problem as the sockets are the same -LRB- they were the last time I was there in 2004 -RRB- TV am not sure as we bought ours in Qatar . We bought a DVD player in Qatar and it worked fine in the UK with UK bought DVDs but again they are cheap enough to buy in Qatar .
Plug sockets here are all 3-pin UK style . However , you might want to bring a stock of 3-pin to 2-pin adaptors with you because anything you by out here will be 2-pin , and the adapters you buy here are very low quality and I 've seen many catch fire or melt .
so if all the plus sockets are 3 pin why are the products 2 pin ? So do you mean I need a 2 pin to 3 pin adaptor ? I am confused ... sorry !
I expect plug sockets are 3-pin cos Qatar used to be protected by the British . Just a guess . Appliances are 2-pin cos they come from Asia I think . It 's juts one of many wonderful things that defies logic here in Qatar . You 'll need adapters that plug into the 3-pin wall socket and take a 2-pin plug .
Have some patience and change the plugs on new items to 3-pin plugs . I hate the adapters here , as previously mentioned the quality is rubbish and they can melt .
The same applies to the 3-pin plugs you buy here as the adapters - they are cheap and prone to catching fire . Best to bring your own from the UK .
While you may find someone to install it , I believe the reason you ca n't find them here is that being `` radio controlled '' they have to be allowed by the government -LRB- in order that the frequency used does n't interfere with any of the official radio frequencies -RRB- - at least that 's what I was told 8 years ago .
sorry i wanted to say government not police
These devices utilise the unlicensed frequency range which does n't interfere with any gov official radio freq range , just like your cordless phone . Any skilled Auto electrician should be able to install it , but be careful unskilled technician can damage your car . These remote starters are available for sale at any cars ' access shop -LRB- around 500 QR -RRB- , I have one for sale if you are interested -LRB- brand new , still in box -RRB- .
As a single `` user '' perhaps you do n't have to worry . I inquired with a North American manufacturer in order to import and sell them here - they advised that one of the documents required was a government permit for the radio frequency concerned . As I said , it was 8 years ago . Times change .
Thank you hamadaCZ for the info . But did you know anyone good in Doha and if it 's possible close to Salwa ?
interesting question . . I too need the answer . . qlates . . put some worthful ... plzz
Yes , you can sponsor your first line relatives and bring them on visit under Qatar airways visa provided you meet the application criteria -LRB- simple : yours and your wife 's passport/id copies , confirmed return ticket booking on QA and the visitor 's pp copies -RRB- -LRB- You can apply direct at immigration also for first line relatives -RRB-
yes you can but your salary should be 12000 qr per month minimum

LCD is not good for eyes LED is better than LCD from experience if you want to check any television Touch the screen of LED , LCD , or plasma by soft skin when TV is on for more than 1hrs than you will fill the difference More hot screen will damage your eye sight that 's why LED 's price are more than LCD , or plasma . | Thank you

For sure you can ship your car for the purpose . Its called as an ESCORT . It is the same procedure that you take the vehicle to other GCC places . You have to apply for a permission to export the vehicle as an ESCORT . But make sure that the vehicle is registered under your name and not in the bank . Otherwise you have to obtain an NOC from the bank . Also there is an additional charge for Insurance . Then you have to consult a shipment company and you have to make a two way bill . Once it reach there in India no need to pay any Taxes . As per my knowledge you can use the vehicle there in India up to 1 year
come again ???
I m almost two years in qatar , but i havent got any chance , I love hockey . Indoor hockey with 5-6 players is possible but , players are less , facility is available , players are not there ... . .

Mazda CX9 all the way . . it was named best sporty suv of year 2009 and has won several awards ... the only disadvantage would be resell value compared to any toyota . check it out in the market . but the driving experience of the mazda CX9 is way better then prado . . you can watch the reviews on serveral website such as http://www.edmunds.com/

CX9 is more crossoverish whereas Prado is a proper SUV and looks like one too . A Toyota is definitely more reliable than Mazda .
The ONLY advantage of Prado is the resale value . Both are not real Off-road options . So for on-road CX-9 is much more fun to drive -LRB- acceleration & Stability -RRB- and much better looking . The myth of the Toyota being more reliable is a very local belief that has no facts to support it . Also do n't fall for the claim of low cost maintenance of Toyota . I have a LC ; the brakes Master and booster costs 8000 QAR which is double the CADILAC ESCALADE that is claimed to be one of the highest when it comes to maintenance cost .
Do n't sell you car before buying . . go for better option & comfort rather pricing it before buying !!

if you are looking for a class building with full maintenance along with fully furnished , you can expect the rent at least 5,500 permonth plus electricity & water .
In some places the cost is so high that you have to pay by hour for one bedroom ...
I 'd go with Ezdan 5k approx per month plus or minus 500
when are you planning to move here ... i have a two bedroom fully furnished flat in ezdaan , al wakra for 4000 . . fully furnished in the sense you dont have to get anything including bedsheet . . :-RRB- its jus 20 mins drive from doha and available from 15th of oct. . .

IKEA
If you 're looking for restaurant quality the New House Complex on B ring road near the Muntazah intersection carries a wide variety . They are expensive but worth it in my opinion
Tavola has the most expensive kitchenware , so I assume it 's good .
Ikea is a good start they sale dutch ovens ... but a bit small in my taste .
Go to any Super Market -LRB- Carrefour , Lulu , etc. . -RRB- , they have Tefal , the quality is very good . Also others like Prestige is good as well .
thanks for your informations ! : - -RRB-

Nara Salon is on Al Waab Street -LRB- same street as Villagio -RRB- . It 's about 300m from the Teyseer petrol station as you head toward the new junction . My wife owns it . I think it 's about QR60 for a regular manicure and QR80 for a regular pedicure -LRB- she 's not here right now so I ca n't ask her -RRB- , and they also do haircuts , hair treatments , make up , facial treatments , waxing and threading , and henna art . You can call 44478008 for an appointment - there 's also a mobile number for the manager -LRB- Joanne -RRB- 33843371 and if you want to see some pictures there 's a Facebook page -LRB- just search for Nara Salon -RRB- . Right now they are also having a sale on Makeup Forever products . If you tell them you heard of the salon through me -LRB- Steve -RRB- you should get a discount on treatments as well . If you do go , please let me know what you think as my wife is always looking for feedback on improving the salon and services .
Steve , if I 'm leaving Villagio , is it before or after Al Bustan St. ?
No idea , lol . It 's at the opposite end of Al Waab , and on the opposite side . When you see the Teyseer Petrol Station on your right , take the cut into the service road that runs parallel to Al Waab . You will see a row of shops -LRB- the usual supermarket , men 's barber , electrical shop , grocer and supermarket -RRB- and the salon is right next to them . Good luck !!
No , you should be fine to return .
NO . you do n't need any NOC . you can enter easily ... . ;-RRB-
Thanks Mandilulur , i appreciate your replies for all my previous questions .
Vegetable market You probably went to the one where you park your car in front of a row of shops selling produce ? They sell in volume -LRB- boxes only -RRB- RIGHT ACROSS from it is the other more visited market . You have to go inside one of the open doors to see the true market . There you can buy just 1 tomato , 1 carrot etc. . They are next to each other .
I completely disagree with that . In my experience -LRB- over 5 years here now -RRB- the Fruit & Vegetable market produce is BY AND FAR the best you can buy in Doha . The grocery stores have improved , but they can not match the freshness from of the wholesale market .
thanks everybody ! will try again this weekend and see if we can find it ... it was chaos anyway but a wonderful experience nevertheless !!!
is the market open during the evenings ? ????? whats the timings for retail sellers ?
use brake oil ... i m serious this time !!
I do n't know but just guessing , you can buy a pain killer maybe .
yes use brake oil to loosen the tooth then when it 's loose pull it out , mafi mushkila ! mafi tooth ! khalas !
visit the dentist as early as possible , meanwhile take some pain killer or chew clove ,
Gargle with luke warm water
visit the dentist and curse him while he is touching and making us scream .
it Hurts !!!!!!!!!!! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
come here let me punch it out for you . either you swallow it or spit it out
very bad Darudu !!!! :-LRB- :-LRB- :-LRB- -LRB- :-LRB- :-LRB- :-LRB- :-LRB- :-LRB- :-LRB- :
to take a day off and see a good Dentist .
No need 2 see a doctor , just stop eating at that side for a wek then everything will be ok
use Xylocaine Spray & Brufen tablets . . both are available in pharmacies . . if the pain is so much then use Brufen 900 else Brufen 600 is ok . . hope it will help you . .
BR it really works if you tried to drop small amount of perfume , believe me .
Yes clove will help .
at office how can i get clove :-LRB- :P -LRB-
toothache . . visit a dentist
hmm at office u can drink green tea . . that might have herbs of clove also . . am not sure . . bt may be green tea will help
you have teeth ?? :P strange :D hehe

aroob . . u commented on other thread abt the inside fear of snake . . thot maybe u do n't have teeth too like snake :P ok then count and temme how many teeth u have ?? :D hehe
use ice cubes , and rub it on area between your thumb and pointer finger , this is the V-shape area where the bones of the thumb and forefinger meet and a little pressure while you do it . It will relieve the pain in minutes . This is true I watched The Doctors program on TV last time . Here is the site which prove it works . http://www.discountdental4u.net/toothache.htm So I guess your office has ref right ? go check if it has some cold drinks or fruits . . improvise . For me i use small pieces of a cold apple . . it works really !
still countin the teeth ??? hehe , , ,32 hein keh 64 ?? : P
Aroob say AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
drink mixed juice or strawberry or orange juice and use cataflame tablet ... and use Colgate -LRB- original -RRB- mouthwash or Listerine mouthwash ... it works ...

thanks whyteknight ... that 's good to hear . . are you from phils ?
lp , it 's true
Based on my experience , yes its quite safe than in agency . . more cost beneficial between the employer and employee ...
If your cousin have the visa already from her present employer ... my advice is to present a Standard Employment contract which i have a format here if you want i will send you the format on which you will attest or her employer in POLO . You can follow there the req . for direct hire .
ilazzie , ask lng sana . na email ko na sa frend ko ang work visa from the company . . I advised her to go to the nearest DHL office para sa authentication ng visa nya . . is it the right step ? and can you please tell me what she needs to do next ? is medical check-up required ? please do advice me , excited na yung frend ko na mkawork dito pero nalilito kami paano i-process ang papers nya sa pinas . .
meryl , English only in the main forum . . what kind of visa does your friend have ? if it 's only visit visa , no need for medical check up , just authentication from the Embassy .
if she 's holding a work visa she needs to undergo medical examination in the Philippines . it 's better to be sure she have all necessary documents , you never know what documents the officers in our airport require . . sometimes , they can be very strict . .
if she is holding a working visa , she really needs to undergo medical exam , visa stamping in Qatar Embassy in Phils , also in POEA she will be required to submit original copy of her contract .
Lp , fortunately the contract i submitted in POEA was accepted even when it did not have authentication yet from qatar embassy
as per the procedures given to me , i will go to POEA only when visa has already been stamped by Qatar Embassy here in Phils ... here is what 's written ... 5 . Once the passport with stamped visa was received , proceed to Philippine Overseas Employment Administration -LRB- POEA -RRB- for verification of the of employment contract and submit the following document for issuance of exit pass or Overseas Employment Certificate -LRB- OEC -RRB- : Original employment contract Visa Medical Certificate PRC License Pre-departure orientation seminar certificate -LRB- to be scheduled and provided by POEA -RRB- got very nice support from the employer , it was them who introduced QL to me . = -RRB-
will it be safe if i go to poea only after visa stamping or should i go there even before that ?
with your Medical Certificate because it usually takes 3 days to a week for the results . They will only release the results once you have the visa . But it 's better to start it so that if you have problems -LRB- like high sugar , high blood pressure , etc. -RRB- you can take corrective actions or take a second opinion and try to get better medical results and have `` fit to work '' evaluation .
i was supposed to have the medical earlier than receviing the visa but unfortunately the clinic i went required me to present my visa first . hopefully my health did not go bad after undertaking annual physical exam for my current employer . another thing , do you know of any qatar embassy accredited clinics are worth visiting ? i have read in some posts that there are really those clinics who tend to harvest money from aspiring ofws . i wish to go to a clinic that can me fair result whether or not positive but at least it is true . wish ko lang ... heheh . . sa mga taga jan baka meron sila mairecommend na clinics dito sa pinas ...
maybe , just make sure you check the company that you will be working for ... like i told you , my cousin used to work there but resigned , but she was not directly employed from the Phils ...
thank you so much mj . will you be kind to let me contact your cousin ? i wish to at least ask some few questions ... she/he can contact me at jolisa.b.calib@gmail.com . . would really appreciate it ...
LOG ON TO QL ! Lol ! Good luck , make sure you have the OEC and that you will be a documented OFW !
so by direct hire you meant , they will be sending you a working visa from here ? correct me if i 'm wrong . .
thanks , will do that ... = -RRB-
If you are asking about direct employment versus contract employment , I would prefer direct .
but many try their luck . Many safenets were placed to make sure that an OFW will be safe once in foreign country . If you are a direct hire but goes with the official protocols -LRB- except you did not pass through an agency -RRB- , it 's okay because you will be a documented OFW . But if you are a direct hire and not an official OFW , I also discouraged it !
it 's direct employment against employment via recruitment agency
recruitment agencies are only after their commissions so is generally better to go direct , unless the company is disreputable ... ... in which case there are many here .
I am a direct hire . What you need to do is check first the company hiring you . For me it was easy because I knew some compatriots who worked for the company in its different branches here in the Gulf Region . Also please check the process in POEA , I believe they have changed it last year . So the process I went through is not the same anymore where I had to go through each step myself . As far as I know it is not anymore `` direct hire '' or `` named hire '' per se as you will need to have your documents processed through an employment agency and not by yourself .
and its safe . . but as Mr. Treysdad sez , , , check first the company and then later there are still some papers to process from POEA ... Congratz and Goodluck ! : -RRB-
i will do as you say ... but the soon-to-be employer even sent me a lengthy step by step procedure to accomplish up to POEA ... treysdad hopefully , i wont need agency anymore . my papers are already with the employer for visa processing.hope it would be released this week . jaryz , thanks for your comment ...
Dieting is effective but its quite slow process , Most effective is Exercise specially if u do it for abdominal muscles . And make sure to Quit 3 things , 1 . Sweets 2 . Rice 3 . Sleeping immediately after having meal . I m sure U wil see better results :-RRB- Good Luck
CMD ???? what is that ?? give me that : - -RRB-
Hi , Honestly , there is no quick way . An unhealthy way is to take a diaretic , but you will lose only water , not fat . That is a temp . fix . As far as medication , there is only one which is called Orlistat . It inhibits the enzyme that breaks down fat , so this will allow fats to pass through you . Other than that , the other diet aids are false , or caffiene-based . In that case , drink coffee . The not eating rice at night is good advice . Remember , it is down to physics : when you eat about 7500 more calories than you burned , you gained a kg . the same is true for losing it .

It should n't matter if this is an Islamic country or not . With all the expats living in this county we could start calling this country cosmopolitan soon . In the UK , we celebrate christmas , chinese new year , diwali , eid , etc. . We welcome all races and cultures and join in regardless . `` Opinions are like bottoms - neither should be shown in public ''
Damn you Pajju . Get your own Chinese dolls to celebrate . . Once they 've met the `` thriller from Kerala '' , they do n't want to know me :O -LRB-

they do n't celebrate new year coz its a muslim state , not allowed here Mamooo ... !! ... understood !!
Denali TROLL mean Masala Dosa
Masala Dosa = in english ?
Because qatar is an Islamic Country & It is not allowed in islam to celebrate the new year , being a responsible resident we should respect the culture of this country and not do such think which should be against islamic culture or rules ... :-RRB- SK
Islamic calendar has different new year date and is celebrated in much different ways .
Masala Dosa = Dosa Masala ; -RRB-
Nothing is more relaxing than flying like an Eagle in Heaven !! Islamic calendar is so different ... it is hijri and if u go back to islam rules its haram to celebrate new year eve ! -LRB- our new year -RRB- but most of them they do . We celebrate in different ways : night clubs , parties , family gatherings ... its haram basically .

Nurses salary are very low here and are not based on anything - they just pay you a salary and thats it . Not too sure about allowances .
Staff Nurse First Level Basic = QR 5500 Transport allowance = QR 1250 Shift allowance = 10 % of basic Special allowance 10 % of basic for ER/DR/OR and some special area Yearly return Ticket or cash equivalent if desired 45 days paid leave yearly or about 3.5 days accumulation per month of service . . can be converted to cash if desired 40 hours work week -LRB- 5 days with 8 hour shift -RRB- Free accommodation for bachelors -LRB- if overseas contract and married with wife or children in Qatar , you can take the money instead = about 5000 QR/month .

An engine that runs at 1200 rpm can live for a million kilometers . An engine that revs above 5000 rpm is finished after 200000 kilometers .
One more example , a Formula 1 engine which revs at 18 000 rpm lasts for approximately 900 to 1000 km , and then it 's trash , although it costs US$ 500 000 . !

although it is called emergency center but in fact all types of sickness are considered emergency here
Two other options - there is a paracetomol suppository for kids called Adol available in most pharmacies here . Also I have calpol if you are near Abu Hamour .
try paracetamol suppositories if oral paracetamol is not appealing to ur child ... u can buy the suppository over-the-counter . . hope ur child will be better soon ...
i thankyou both : - -RRB-
there is a paracetamol suppository called ` Enelfa 250 ' for kids from 1-6 years . we use this for my son who doesnt like to take the oral medicines . hope ur child will get well soon .
Dont use your brain on care for children health , If he has got fever take him direct to the doc . immediately and let the doc take care of him . Sorry its nothing to hurt anyone .
Thank you all for your help . He still has a fever but I have managed to get him to take some medicine . He is congested with a cold so I am fairly sure it is just a virus and he does not need antibiotics but I will take him to the hospital as recommended by some of you if he is still ill tomorrow morning . Thank you once again . I appreciate the support
I would just like to thank those who recommended the children 's emergceny centre . I took my son this morning and it was brilliant . Thank you so much . My poor boy has a bad ear infection and is now on antibiotics . The doctor was great and the whole process only took about 40 mins and cost me 11 Riyals .
take him to children emrgency Hamad in Al sadd ... u only require your passport and ur son passport and they will take care of him ... immedietly
Great is that a hospital ? I do n't think I need to take him yet but if the fever continues to tomorrow I may have to . Thanks again
yes its a well equipped hospital for kids , and i really had a good expierence with them .

This sounds very fishy ... upload a certificate ? Best is to read up on their course content and the institutions accreditation rather than what the certificate looks like .
looks like u r into forging the papers instead of joinning the school ! why do n't u go to the school itself and ask for samples ???
Call aptech to give them the certificates directly ... or even better they will help u in printing the certificates for u. . . pple like u are disgrace , asking openly to be part of a forgery ...
It seems you are more interested in looking at graphics & design of the certificates than acquiring knowledge & skills .

As long as the accommodation is free , you 're good . Is that offer better than your current job ? If yes , then I 'd go for it if I were you . . but I 'm not you so you know best = P
the package is not attractive make sure what type of accommodation they will provide , otherwise demand for acco . allowance and ask for more basic salary
Yup . . not bad .
The title of this post should actually be salary FIRST and safety NEXT
LOL XD
what about 4000 qr + accomodation of HMC ? will that be fine for indian perspective ?
Ask what type of accomodation and also how many sharing . Same about transport . Otherwise , go for it . . Good Luck !
accomodation will be in a shared flat , max 2-3 person each having 1 room.transport will b on own .
` afwan , mj . Edit : on behalf of everyone above .
This kind of practices could have been paced out sooner for white collar jobs however for technical jobs it could be the different in approach and superiority to do trouble shooting and problem solving . However for companys doing a simple processes and routines , theres no reason for differences in pay .
Supply and demand , capitalism 101 pure and simple . If enough well educated , well trained , well experienced , well qualified ` Asians ' -LRB- Japanese usually get higher offer -RRB- refused to work for a quarter of salary of a comparable Europeans then in theory the companies will have to offer more to attract them . Unfortunately , in practice for every Asian that refuse to work for a quarter of the European 's salary there are ten more lining up to work for one-fifth . I think the question should be re-phrased : Why would company hire a European/American/Australian / Japanese etc for four times the salary of a comparably qualified ` Asians ' ????? Cheers SK
sabrang kidul , that looks reasonable and probably right .
Sorry to say my friends that discriminations are well alive in this country . Most of the time Asians has more experience and even got higher degree of educations against Westerns . The sad reality is that most company are impressed with the way they look and converse in English ... but of course !! that 's their mother tongue . But let them write a proper business letter ... most of them are unprofessional . Some company look also for the passport when hiring people . But you know what ? If your company got nonsense recruitment personnel and system ... they easily deceived by westerns . No offense to Western people but these point of view are based on facts ... however some of them are qualified as well ... not being unfair and speaking generally .
It 's to do with the cost of living in home countries and other aspects . If you look around , on the whole , a Western Expat will get more in Asia , Russia and africa also .
Nobody is Perfect - I am Nobody I think arabs are in awe of Europeans and afraid of them . I think maybe they feel inferior to them or do not want to look cheap in front of them so they give them more salary to show that they are also superior and can afford them ... even though the European guy maybe out of work and usless in his country and desperate to get some work here.He just wants to come here for a couple of years to have some fun & sun and escape the cold and rain for while and spice up his resume to resettle back with some real work experience . At least thats what i have seen in Doha for the last 10 years . I have no grouse against them nor have i been affected adversly by them at any point of time . ... ... Just my opinion .
Hi Alexa , I 'm asking a rethorical question about why would companies hire a ` Westerner ' -LRB- I prefer to use this term -RRB- for 4 times the salary of ` Asians ' . According to a pure cost-benefit point of view , they would expect and should get a quadruple of productivity from the Westerner . Question is , do they -LRB- companies or state for this matter -RRB- get what they bargained for ? The answer is -LRB- if indeed it is true that westerner are paid 4 times more , a proposition that need to be investigated further -RRB- a resounding YES , as we can see more westerner is arriving and based on the cost benefit principle above , companies feel that they still get ahead by hiring westerners . Here we assume that no one -LRB- companies or states -RRB- is stupid enough to prefer losing instead of winning . There 's a catch though . By ` productivity ' they may not only refer to tangible things such as amount of product you produce or sales achievement . It may also include things such as prestige -LRB- ie . this real estate company is under British management -RRB- or something as cynical -LRB- as another poster put it -RRB- fear or subconcious inferiority complex . True or nor , I do n't know ... Myself , If I think I am underpaid -LRB- dont really care what my colleages get -RRB- , then I 'll try to negotiate a better deal . If I can not get a better deal , then I try to prove that I am underpaid by looking at a better job that give me more . If I can not find a better job , then may be I 'm paid exactly what my market worth is ... . . might as well shut my mouth and enjoy ... . -LRB- NOte : ` paid ' here mean the total compensation I get : sallary , job satisfaction , quality of live , traffic , red tapes etc -RRB- . Enough bubling past my curfew . Adios for tonight , cheers SK

Three cheers to you . It 's happened in Kuwait and in Saudi , it 's been discussed time and time again and it 's a matter of economics . That 's my last post in this topic .
Unfortunately it matters where you come from , not what you know or what kind of qualifications you have . If that is not racist discrimination , I do n't know what is .
get married to a european .
maybe because the cost of living in europe is much much higher than in asia ?
thats the way it is , unfortunate , but reality of favoritism in this country . * Bunga *

... of ` Pay for Nationality ' . The labour laws of Qatar are primitive and pre industrialization practices have continued to date . Companies need to realize that the world has moved forward . The logic behind this practice is not ignorance as many would think , it is more of a feeling of applying economics around cost of living in the country of origin and extrapolating it to arrive at the salary figures . This has been taken directly from SaudiAramco . Source : - A study Conducted by FriedUnicorn - Vol I -LRB- September ,1999 -RRB-
I want to tell all my Indian friends that if these idiots want to spend their money by paying four times whatever a white skinned drunkard racist braggart is worth , why should we mind it ? It 's not that if they do n't pay them , that money will come to us . Let them pay peanuts and enjoy monkey 's work performance . Nothing in this world is unfair . There is always a way of getting things even . Are you nuts ? ... . no doubt I am crazy about you !

Can we really class Canadians as westerners ?
Is anyone here an employer who could answer the question why hire more expensive Europeans rather than the cheaper Asians ?
These discussions invariably lead nowhere . The bottom line is that we all sign contracts that we are happy with . So why worry about what the other guy is earning ?
They think west is best , how correct . Back in Dubai , we used to sell rubbish products at sky-high prices just because they were made in EU and always struggled to sell products made in Asia at low prices also even though they were exceeding the required specification . <aÂ href=http://s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/?action=view&current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpgÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpgÂ border=0Â alt=Photobucket> </a>

When they had Local or Asian in the job it all went to Crap so to say , I was hired to clean the place up and set it back on track . The procedures were in place but the Asians or Local where too lazy to follow the path . Safety was one of the main issues , Accountability and having the work complete not just having the box ticked . I am happy they employ Asians here , it makes us guys look good . So thank you for your poor quality of workmanship and organization skill , you qualification may be high on paper . . But thats as far as it goes . Again . Thank you Rules are a guideline for intelligent people , but they must be adhered to by idiots .
@ miss pakistan , i did n't know we 've met !!! yes i 'm jobless , i live @ home with my parents , you forgot to add , live off them as well & basically waste my time on the internet 24/7 , spot on ! you 'd put Sherlock Holmes to shame with your investiga
to be individualistic , , , which is not the case at all in the east , , , this allows westerners to make an informed decision on the spot ... and westerners come in all colours , I was not narrowing the field to whites , , , , like it , lump it , do what you want with it , but its the truth , , , I am just being objective ...
What is a Westerner ? Someone who is from Europe , US , Canada Etc. ? or someone who comes from a developed country ? There are many of us going around whom are paid salaries that is the same as local hire or asian hire also in many countries ! Do not think it is fair to generalise that Westerners get paid more for everything . It depends on the job and scope that you are involved in . Also bear in mind , even though Qatar is personal income tax free , some expats still have to pay taxes or other in their home countries which also accounts for higher pays .
... ca n't afford to spend a lot of time during the day on QL - too much work and responsibilities ... and that 's just ONE reason . For once I have to agree with Jackfrost : Quote : ' I have worked in 4 countries where it positions are for only western . When they had Local or Asian in the job it all went to Crap so to say , I was hired to clean the place up and set it back on track . The procedures were in place but the Asians or Local where too lazy to follow the path .

My husband has been working overseas for over 30 years now and the responsibility will only be given to somebody who can take the shit the position makes you go through and actually deal with it . You need to be firm , have capacity to argue the necessary points and leadership personality . And unfortunately there are a lot of people who lack these requirements .
really fair ... if it does then there would no poor or rich and just same stature in life . we just need to accept the fact and live with it `` We can not change the past , we only learnt from it ''
That could be a reason arabic_nightingale along with the colour of the skin too . . All the other reasons mentioned above are plain nonsense in my opinion . I am willing to put my education and knowledge to the test against any of the western expatriates working here in similar field and there wo n't be much difference . As for someone mentioning above that Indians come here because they ca n't get job anywhere else , well I work for the same company here for which I was working in India , the company which picked me from my campus so maybe the desire of not leaving that company got me here rather than any lack of job opportunity . <aÂ href=http://s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/?action=view&current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpgÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpgÂ border=0Â alt=Photobucket> </a>
MP I love what I do and I get paid 4 times here for the same thing I was doing back home so I stay . . I already accepted that , I am just saying he gets more pay because of higher cost of living in his home country and his skin colour , not because he is better than me at what we do like some people are suggesting here . <aÂ href=http://s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/?action=view&current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpgÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpgÂ border=0Â alt=Photobucket> </a>
Colour discrimination occurs everywhere , if you do n't know that then you have lived in a very protective world . Higher cost of living back home matters as most of the expats are working here to save money and one day go back home to settle down with their savings here . <aÂ href=http://s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/?action=view&current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpgÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpgÂ border=0Â alt=Photobucket> </a>
Westerners come in all colours , y' know ? There 's probably a big difference in cost of living in home countries though . ***** If you have n't got anything nice to say , do n't say anything at all *****
I am talking from my experience snessy , We have only whites from those countries in our company and knowing their salaries , I know how much more they are getting paid for the same and at times even lesser jobs ... <aÂ href=http://s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/?action=view&current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpgÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpgÂ border=0Â alt=Photobucket> </a>
I empathise Sandeep , I agree you should earn the same as your western colleagues . For hubby & I , we 're not earning enough to save either , our mortgage and bills back in the UK eat away at all our money :--LRB- ***** If you have n't got anything nice to say , do n't say anything at all *****
That 's a pathetic excuse , colour should never ever come into it , why would a white person deserve more money , that 's absolutely ridiculous ! I wish you were getting paid the same as them :--LRB- ***** If you have n't got anything nice to say , do n't say anything at all *****

I have a basic question . For how many Indians , middle east is first choice for work ? Usually , those who work here are already rejected from US and european countries -LRB- and 70 % are rejected by their own country -RRB- I do n't know about other fields , but the doctors working in middle east are substandard compared to their own counterparts in India and the european doctors are even more substandard to these already substandard doctors . Now , the conclusion is that quality control is a joke here . Employing few europeans -LRB- and one or two Americans -RRB- makes things look good . But they ca n't afford more than few and so they employ majority asians at cheapest rates to be cost effective , And the end result is a substandard organisation which spends lots of money , has poor performance and manipulated quality control -LRB- usually through media -RRB- . Are you nuts ? ... . no doubt I am crazy about you !
Quite clearly , you have n't the faintest idea what you 're talking about & you have n't interacted with a lot of educated , informed , well travelled NON-WESTERNERS ... probably has something to do with the fact that you 're a racist bigot ... THERE 'S an informed decision ... from a NON-WESTERNER ... deal with it ...
@ sun26872 ... middle east is first choice for MANY Indians so you 're completely wrong about that one , for a lot of Indians , they do n't mind coming to the mideast ` cos it 's just a 3hr . flight from home , earnings are tax-free & there are a lot of p
Life Is UnFair and Thats It
@ Alexa , you 're confusing me with someone else luv ! ... i lived briefly in the UK & briefly in the Caribbean but i was educated & trained in my home country i.e India @ well reputed institutions & i 'm very proud of it ...
Shahzad It 's just human nature . If I was paid higher than the westerners at the same post , I wo n't see a problem and will justify it someway or another . They are doing the same but I expect the status quo to remain as it is and I have made peace with it . <aÂ href=http://s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/?action=view&current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpgÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpgÂ border=0Â alt=Photobucket> </a>
sorry sandeep for misuderstandin actually i was quotin britexpat where he said that Y WORRY WHAT OTHER IS EARNING . . for me as well its kinda weird that .
if you knew my salary , Jackfrost , you will get a frostbite . I am agree with everyone that if you have signed a contract , you should n't complaint . Likewise , I maintain that Europeans and Americans working here are of inferior quality than their Asian counterpart , but I do n't have a problem with that too because their salary does n't come from my account . Europeans are very good only in one aspect that they can convince people of their lies.But I personally consider a great quality to be a convincing liar because nothing succeeds like money . I wish we Asians learn to stop working hard and start convincing people of our leadership qualities and individualism . But then who will do the real work ? Are you nuts ? ... . no doubt I am crazy about you !
i have seen this incident in one of the renowed compnay here . They do not have any auditing on that . HOW MUCH Company pay to whom and pay for what Even to contractors they are not paying equal .
Quoting sun : ` Europeans are very good only in one aspect that they can convince people of their lies ' . They do n't need to do that as their professionalism speaks for itself .
Ok who wants to bet a month 's salary with me that this pink advertising campaign which is irritating everyone is designed by either American or European . <aÂ href=http://s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/?action=view&current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpgÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpgÂ border=0Â alt=Photobucket> </a>

How many Asian Universities are in the top 100 worldwide ?
ES that can become a never ending discussion . . Somebody soon will mention the large number of Indians working in NASA , Google , Microsoft in US if they had such good students coming out of US or why most of the doctors in UK are from India and so on and so on . . <aÂ href=http://s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/?action=view&current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpgÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpgÂ border=0Â alt=Photobucket> </a>
Ghandhi and Nehru were both educated at UK universities and look what they went on to achieve ... It is a never ending discussion Sandeepkadian and although some companies here do not discriminate others do for some reasons . So while some companies are willing to pay more for ` westerners ' some people will feel aggrieved . However I would like to make 10 times my salary that I could get back home like some of the Asians that work here !

I will give you an example that might show you a reason why lets say Filipinos as mentioned in this thread are earning little bit less than other nationalities : Check this address , or else read below my comment to one filipina lady who envy others who get more than her husband : http://www.qatarliving.com/node/825227 X is a civil Engineer from Manila working in W Consturction Company and earning 5000 USD per month . Y is a civil Engineer from US working in W Construction Company and earning 7500 USD per month . Both X and Y has 13 years experiance in thier field . Why X earns 5000 USD and Y earns 7500 USD per month ? Discrimination ? My opinion is : - X needs to work in W Construction Company for 5 years to save money for buying a house back home in the Philippines . - Y needs to work in W Construction Company for 15 years to save money for buying a house back home in the US . - X has one son only who goes to Z university -LRB- One of the best well known expensive universities in the Philippines -RRB- where the fees are 30 000 peso -LRB- 2300 QR !! -RRB- per year . - Y has one son also who goes to G University -LRB- which is one of the humble small universities in California -RRB- where the fees are 20 000 USD -LRB- 73 000 QR -RRB- . - X has a wife working in Kuwait with one son only and a mistress in Manila and a gf in Qatar . He has to support himself only and maybe send some gifts for his son from time to time . - Y has a wife who is taking care of 6 children back home and he is the only one responsible for the whole family . - If X is single and would like to get married , it wo n't cost him more than lets say 100 000 Peso -LRB- 7600 QR -RRB- for one of the best wedding in a luxarious Cruise in the Ocean . - If Y is single and originate , but a Muslim , he can not get married with less than 100 000 USD -LRB- 365 000 QR -RRB- due to how expensive are weddings in the US , Hotels , Wedding Planner Companies , The Mahr -LRB- might reach millions -RRB- which is supposed to be given to the wife as a gift to buy all what she needs and would love to have . Many Empployers know these facts and many others when recruiting staff . If any of us is not satisfied with his job , then he better go straight home , or is it only Jelousy and Envy ? For what ? Although his income is more than yours , most probably you got better life than him back home . Better House , Your kids are enrolling in better schools and universities ... etc So please enough Envy .
is how much you have negotiated your salary ? I have one main principle regarding this story : you are asking for an amount . If you are receiving what you have asked for , why are you complaining . If the offer is lower , why have you accepted it ? On the other hand I know a lot of Indians or Iranians that are paid better than me . So , maybe is not the nationality . Each of us consider himself the most beautiful/handsome , the smartest , the most skilled etc. person . Maybe is not true , have you think about this ??
laurana , Romania comes below India and Iran in the Qatari HR guidelines for salary allocation .
It 's the effect of petrodollars on unused brains , associated with lack of education and real expertise !

So that is why Microsoft Vista was crap and Windows 7 gives the black screen of death ? You are not helping the Indians case here ...
Agree with my exiled friend -LRB- hope I can call you a friend -RRB- . It is not racism per se but rather a nationalism , pasportism or perhaps Jawaazsafarism -LRB- please correctt my Arabic -RRB- . In many companies Mr Tendulkar will get the same package as Mr Collingwood eventhough he just get his british passport last week . However without an Australian passport Mr Afridi will not get the same as Mr Ponting despite the fact that he had lived , study and work all his live there . Oh well , in the end no one force us to sign that dotted line and no one -LRB- I assume -RRB- hold our passports and prevent us to say goodbye . Cheers SK
On a general level , westerners seem to be able to DEMONSTRATE better levels of leadership and trouble shooting . -LRB- Just see how many countries are there in the west that are poor/under developed/developing compared to Asia/Africa . and its not that they have an advantage of natural resources or climate over others -RRB- They can also sell themselves well . They also tend to grasp the bigger picture well , compared to the Asians who excel in specialising in a particular discipline of study . But then , this is only a generalisation . This is not to say there arent any asians who cant do the same . Whether you look at Mittal/TATA/SONY etc and what they have achieved in the west , the Asians who work at high profile jobs in western countries or the IIM/IIT graduates who are almost completely recruited by western companies , there are enough proofs for Asian talent and capabilities . But the issue is that , due to the problems intrinsic to the demographics of Asian population , there is quite a sizeable chunk of the population who have not been fortunate enough to get the same kind of education and exposure that their more fortunate counterparts could attain . This particular section , which is quite sizeable , tips the balance when it comes to the general world view of the quality of asian workforce . Also , I am not quite sure how it works out in the west . Do they pay less for asian employees , like here in the middle east ? if not , that is another pointer , which could tell us that the workforce from Asia that ends up in gulf -LRB- that includes yours truly -RRB- is somehow the ones that couldnt make it in their own homes or in the west . It could also mean the ME perception of Asians has a hand in this . Before accusing anybody of RACISM in this matter , what the Asians should think about is , what exactly weighs in favor of the westerner and how to make the same factor work for them . Its not skin , its more than passport , its the BRAND that has been created around it . Like how sony made it in the west.Morita knew how to combine creative , cost-effective engineering -LRB- their core philosophy -RRB- with product marketing and brand creation.End of the day , its about brand creation . As much as I have seen brilliant managers from west , I have also seen ones who have reached that position simply by virtue of their passport . That is what you call brand value . -LRB- Not saying that there arent local/Asian managers who have been lucky in a similiar way , for them its other reasons -RRB- Have we reached a place where we are ready to launch that brand that would do half the selling for us ? Till then , Asians will have to put up with lesser pays . Coz like everything , one day , `` this too shall pass ''
My god i bet you have had heaps of good quqlity jobs in the past with your education , Where is Asia . . wher is teh Middle east . . all the same . . ok i wil hire you . . now go make me some tea
Estong , If certain westerns were offered what certain Asian countries pay their citizens , I do n't think that you would have a single one of those westerners working here . This country is not a country where we settle here with our families for good , its just a base camp , to make some money to fuel our lives back home , and that we all know have different costs . Not saying that this is correct but its one of the factors that ME does what they do and gets away with it !
hey jackfrost ... where 's my tea ?
http://www.qatarliving.com/node/165018 Rules are a guideline for intelligent people , but they must be adhered to by idiots .
do n't agree to work for 5000 , ask 50,000 . Simple as that . You AGREE to work for 5000 . WHO to be blamed ? I do n't think any canadian would agree to come to qatar and work here for 5000 QR . Home he/she will get this QR5000 -LRB- about CAN$ 1,500 -RRB- as unemployment benefit . Blame rather YOUR government which makes you guys working for US$ 100-200 a month , and to be happy that you got a chance at least to get this job . <i> <b> ********************* `` What lies behind us and what lies before us are small compared to what lies within us .

Anyone of you who does n't think this is because of your passport is welcome to send me a message and I will show them the power of the colour of the passport , atleast at 50 places in a single day in Qatar . . Get real people ... STOP PRETENDING THAT RACISM HAS GONE AWAY !!!!!!
The color of the passport may be the first selection criteria -LRB- we all agree that this is wrong and subjective -RRB- but I hope that most of the cases the evaluation of skills , competences , education and experience will be the determining factors ! I am obviously referring to Lead Positions !
Laurana , I was teasing you in response to the way you referred to 2 countries ; -RRB-
Its not racism , it may be nationalitism to create a new word but they are people with western passports who are non-white that earn ` western ' money . It may be wrong but you signed the contract when you came so it was your decision . Maybe go home and negotiate better for your next contract and if they do n't give you what you want , then do n't come .
@ Dohadiesel , eh ? are n't you on the wrong thread about this ?! ... there 's a LOT more choice in Singapore than there is here , as for the prices , since you 're living there & i have n't been there for a good few months now , your beer will be cheaper
I can take it even if it was for real . My point was just : `` if you do n't like it who 's keeping you here ? There are two full lists for every of us regarding pro- or anti- working as an expat . We are the sole responsible for our acts and decisions . I could work in Germany for almost the same money as here . Part of my decision was to gain some ME experience and to live in a more quite environment . I am not sure 100 % it was the wisest thing but I am not complaining about it . . Anyhow , nice to meet you . Hope you are enjoying the life here ... :-RRB-
Laurana , Honestly , after all the professional frustrations I 've been through here , the only reason that retains me in this country is the money ! I can ensure you that ME experience is NOT an asset and it is often seen as a disadvantage when you 'll try to reintegrate the western job market . It is well known in the west that the professional standards in the ME are very low . There are several reasons , just to name a few : blind localization and promotions of unqualified , non-competent and uneducated local people in lead positions ; low work-force salaries , non-existent real HR policies , etc. . . Nobody is motivated here to pursue a career as all know that wo n't happen ... and so many more ... in summary this is not a normal country where hard work , innovation , leadership and results are rewarded accordingly . This is a country where the wealth pours out of the soil , regardless people being hard working or being passive and do the minimum to get the most ... the second scenario is the actual reality and the locals are to lazy or to incompetent or the hopeless to control this disgrace .
I have n't seen your comment before coming here ... I agree with you . But now I will finish what I have started . After that , we 'll see ...
right aluminar and we have to work harder to get atleast somethin called SALARY which all gone on the 5th of every month .
I would disagree and suggest that It 's probably a Lebanese outfit . .
It depends on the company , and the contract . In my company , the position dictates the salary and there is some `` wiggle room '' in negotiating a higher salary or benefits if you bring something spectacular to the table -LRB- like great negotiating skills , I guess -RRB- . I do n't know how it is elsewhere , but I guess my question is : if you are so unhappy with your contract , why did you sign it ?
People who complain why others get more than them are usually social climbers who ca n't eat back home , and once they come here they forget about thier origin and start comparing themself with others . Why and Why ? To make it short , If you do n't like it , get the hell out of here and go somewhere else . Thats it .
Damn . . You sounded just like Mrs. Expat there :O -LRB-
that 's a REALITY that we should accept . .
Remember the white population have always been the boss , the asian have always been the workers , take it or leave it , go home and get bread crumbs . . but doo tell me as i would love to get frostbite ... too affraid hay ... thought so lier Rules are a guideline for intelligent people , but they must be adhered to by idiots .

There are several swimming schools in Qatar . Pick one that works for you . Good luck

What is a swimming school ? Never heard of such a thing . You can try Aspire , they have , as far as I know , swimming courses .

For a Racecar it will make a difference , for you - nothing . The advantage of Nitrogen in tires is that the Airpressure will raise less than with Air when you drive fast .
i have it before on my previous car and it really helps on the tires , especially during summer , because this nitro air will help to cool your tire.if you want nitro air on your tire , Q TYRES in salwa road have it ... . keep it cool ...
hi . . i am using this Nitrogen in my car 's tires . . really it is good . . I use it because i travel alot with my car it keep the wheel cold in summer . . hardly increase or loss in pressure during driving and with time . . goodluck
N2 -LRB- nitrogen -RRB- is the stabil gas will not change the composition when receive heat . normally in summer the road is litle bit hot the friction between road and tire can change the composition of normal air in side tire . if you will make along journey or you want to make race recommended to pressurise with Nitrogen but ensure quality of tire in excelent condition .
btw , if your children in nursery you only can leave them at 7.45 in their classroom .

us young expats really do seem to be a rare bunch here on oldliving.com lol
well im 23 and i just got here on the 5th of sept from london . im loving it so far . its been so much fun so far . i have a friend shes 25 and she moved here 2 weeks ago . i met her here in doha .
Hey ! been here for 2 weeks now . . and it is not that bad , ignore the negative comments .
I 'm new here too and met alot of my friends at work.Living in Ezdan helps too you can always go down for a game of pool or pong if you have nothing else to do .
The best thing to do , is to go out and meet people and slowly you 'll build up your friends . But just think about the places you go to meet people and the kinds of people you would want to be friends with :-RRB- Also love the line , live the way you love :-RRB- ^ ^
Hey everyone , I am moving to Doha later this month from the UK . I 'm 26 and would love to meet some like-minded expats . Whats the best way to meet people ?
depending on what you 're looking for , there is everything available in Doha ... you just have to know the right people and do the right networking . There are bars and clubs where you can go and meet and mingle with eligible youngsters like yourself and TinkerBell : - -RRB-
yes dnt have to worry there is a guide ready for you : P
Doha is not such a bad place , , , I 've been here since a long while and its a place that initially when you land , you may have a cultural shock ... but this place tends to grow on you :--RRB- Like someone earlier said on this thread , that you can start making friends at work , , , , and then in a few weeks , you 'll have yourself sorted with more friends ... Wish you a pleasant stay in Doha ...
yr right adix iam also new to doha and young as well but from india hope to get new friends
Radoha , Awesome . I play a lot of footy back here in LDN so would be very keen for that . Does anyone know if 19,000 K a month incl accom & travel is enough to live on and have a nice flat ?
I guess there are lots of young expat here including me . but sorri i dun think u can make any frn here based on Doha daily life style .
Agree with Adix . . I have lived in a few Gulf countries earlier but I like Doha the most . This is a place where you can pursue your interests like sports , music or arts etc. . Dubai was good too but a bit fast and busy . This is a nice laid back city .
It 's mostly the young generation that moves to Qatar . They want the kind of future the previous generations were n't given .
I 'd love to make friends with you , but considering what your job title is , I 'm having second thoughts : - -LRB-
u can live of we can live off ... lols
Hi Dan , There 's more mid age expats here than young ones . But there are young pple as well and i 'm sure you 'll meet some . You need to be patient though . Social life here seems a bit SLOW - even inshallah sounds too fast to describe it . You meet people but because of cultural differences it takes time to find someone on the same wavelength .
Families are a minority in Qatar . It 's actually a bachelor country . However , most of them are kept in ghettoes .
My issue is that my Offices are in Dubai , and i am a Key Account Manager looking after this region , so i wouldnt have any work colleagues in Doha
lolz LP
Hi . Iam a very young expat . I just got married recently . Iam no more a very young expat .
Travel to Dubai as often as you can for `` official meetings '' then
whats wrong with expats like my age . . ?? well most sales ladies and cashiers are young . .
ull find lot of them in various groups on friday evenings near arab roudabout , national and souq area discussing social life
Lol Oryx . Good one ! Never thought of that . Whatever you vividly imagine , Ardently desire , Sincerely believe and Enthusiastically act upon , Must inevitably come to pass .

we pray 5 times aday each prayer time differs on daily basis according to the day or night lenghth -LRB- the difference may be 1 minute every day `` more or less '' -RRB- the timing is avilable everywhere : on the net , on ATHAN softwares or in the calendars in a small table in everyday 's paper . the Mo'athen who is responsible for making Athan which is cosidered as the official announcement of prayer time thae mo'athen make the Athan in the mic . at the specific time . then after a pre-determined time he make Iqama which is the announcement for people who came to the Masjid after Athan to stand up for the prayer the time between Athan & Iqama is varied between 5 to 25 minutes according to the prayer e.g : Fajr -LRB- dawn -RRB- 25 , Maghhrib -LRB- sunset -RRB- 5 ... etc. .
The only reason i 'm asking is because I 'm unfamilar with the Islam culture and the religion . I just wanted to get a idea of how the prayer time were set because i do n't want to cross path with anyone during that time . You see , I 'm moving to Qatar in May and I think it would beneficial to me to know at least the basic of Islam . Since Islam require the follower to pray five times a day , I was wondering if it troublesome for someone who is not islam to be sound asleep during the PA call out .
so it is all about sleep !! do n't worry it is not very loud and if : it wo n't take more than 3 minutes ! and u will be awake in 3 prayers AT LEAST !! happy dreams
Inside each mosque there 's a mic . The imam or the personne in charge makes the first call to allow people to get ready after few mn he makes the second call and the prayer begins .
Jani what is that suppossed to mean ? World affairs and his nationality dont really have much to do with what he is asking . ____________________________________________________ `` Diplomacy is the art of saying ` Nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers ''
If you 're few meters away from the mosque you can here the adhan -LRB- call for pray -RRB- done by the muezzin -LRB- one who calls for pray -RRB- and after few minutes istiqama -LRB- stand up for pray -RRB- . < img src = http://www.wonderfulinfo.com/funny/actualphotos/zidaneheadbutt.gif >
It 's already very nice to him to ask about it . Your comment is a nonsens.Why did you post it in first place ...
Brainless guys like jani3 give Islam a bad name . Pekkier posted a question , which to me seems very genuine . He probly has very little knowledge about Islam . jani3 , first read carefully pekkier 's Q . Then reply . Instead of posting dumb replies and scaring someone who is interested in Islam .
thx for puzzle . . come back with some more good eveng to u too
Ohh herbert y gettin angry if u r wrong ... n y the hell u call ur name , others u dumb . . now its my turn to say u sound WEIRD
Now i know my ABC 's . . Boys and girls come sing with me . . : P
You are wrong mauvecraze ... read the question carefully . .
pri ... no
Hmmmm its ... `` U '' letter !
Please Explain why Q is one of the answer . .
every word that begins with `` q '' is followed by `` u '' , except for Qatar that is ...
Visper ... simple . . u will never be able to pronounce `` Q '' without the help of `` U '' ... So `` Q '' always carry `` U '' . . And the other answer is `` W '' None of the other letters need `` U 's '' help . .

gudone , was that a complement ??
we -LRB- V -RRB- go , U follows , , rite ?

afrinnabees , sorry , that 's not the answer . . actually there are two answers for that question . . as Visper said -LRB- though to me -RRB- , twist your brain . . you will get it . . `` O '' does n't carry `` U '' always
pri its not `` V '' Mysense its not `` I ''
you are ` L'ove ... : -RRB-
Its letter '' Q ''
Guys ... am talking about Letter `` U '' . Not the word `` You ''

Boat Restaurant ?? Near the sheraton ?? ... Is there one ?? and to my knowledge can you please give some more detail !!
when was the last time you saw it ?
that didnot last for long and was closed after 3 months . its parked in wakra all messed up now .
You could try the Yamaha showroom beside 51 East -LRB- Modern Home -RRB- .
Yamaha music showroom besides Jarir Bookstore on Salwa Road . This place is just 50yards after Ramada Signal towards Midmac r/a . Are you new to Doha ? I bought an acoustic for QR750 last year !
There is this shop besides Jarir Bookstore . Yamaha . .
Try the Badie Studio near souq Ahmed . its the best music eqpt showroom in Doha .
Badie Studio near the Souqs is definitely the best place . You will get personal attention and very good advice . I bought a guitar there last September . Ray was very helpful . THey also have a website . Tel 4423554
Badie studio is probably the best bet for stylish electric guitars , though they have a good deal of acoustics too . Yamaha on the other hand , probably best known for amateurs , does n't have a appeal to both sound and style . If you are really a music guru , then you should buy a fender . details : Music Corner Fax : +974Â 4374586 , mail : musiccorner@qatar.net.qa

Thanks for your reply ! That is interesting . I am coming from N America ... so you really think I can ask for 25 % more , when in Qatar I 'll be earning tax free dollars ?
Watch out for those `` tax free dollars . '' You still owe taxes in the US and if you are Canadian you have to divest of all property and financial ties in order to qualify for tax free status . And yes , 25 % is considered fair , if not minimal . Mandi
Yes , I am divesting , so all $ will be tax free . However , I was recently offered a job in Saudi for half the gross I am currently earning -LRB- consultant -RRB- , and they did n't budge in negotiations . I am hoping that Qatar has deeper pockets , or it wo n't be worth it . So ... I 'm thinking that going in with a starting position of current gross plus 25 might be a little extreme , given the regional remuneration .
Oh yes , I am very Western and very white . May I ask how you come by your advice ?
25 % plus plus has been the standard package for westerners for Hamad Medical Corp and for the six American universities in Qatar . Well , with the exception of Texas A&M which offers very competitive salary in the US plus 30 % . We 've been in medical in the Gulf for ten years now . Feel free to PM me . Mandi
Hi , am a Canadian trained specialist family physician doing excellently here and was looking for opportunities in Qatar due to family situation . It was really disappointing . Can someone help with contacts . I read the posts above . There is no way they 'll pay 20-25 % above what I make here . Thanks Asmeralda
No , the private clinics wo n't pay anything and you can see why when you look at their fees . Compared to the West , medical care is vey cheap here . The only places that MAY pay Western rates for Western physicians are HMC -LRB- if they recruit you -RRB- and Aspetar . Mandi
i am not a MD but what i know you worth way more than that ... you are sacrificing to change your life style and cross Atlantic ... noo.noooo do n't settle with less or you gon na regret it ... Oooo yeah
thanks for your thoughts Accolade .
Please be Vettel !
It 's a dillema . . Want Red Bull to triumph because they deserve it . However , ca n't stand Mark webber . . As for Vettel ...
Poor Button getting nearly carjacked in Brazil . . It is going to the last race , ca n't see Alonso winning from 5th on the grid .
Is there any place/cafe/club where Formula - 1 racing is shown today ... ??
keeping my fingers crossed for any of the red bull drivers to win the championship .
If Redbull has to win , this is their year , coz i really doubt they ll get this close next season . . Its good for F1 if there are more competitors than jus the Mc Larens and Ferraris
Down to the last race where Alonso can finish 2nd and still win the title . . Webber under pressure now . .
It will be interesting . Red Bull sided with Vettel and Webber ca n't be happy . Not simple for Alonso . Red Bulls easily outpaced the Ferrari . Let 's hope that McLaren can help Alonso in Abu Dhabi .
Is n't it ?
1 - its easy to get it , it takes time though 1-2 weeks , even if you have one in your own country . 2 - depends on the model and condition 3 - yeah they are but most of them are garbage . and the good ones cost too much . riding in traffic is suicide however , qatar has , without a shadow of a doubt , the WORST traffic in the world . All they like to do is blame other nationalities for being bad drivers while its them who contributes to it . I have motorcycles here btw , but only ride at night well after 11 usually . Cause yeah , car drivers are depressingly bad here . They are usually surprised when they see a motorcycle and dont know how to react to one near them . They will turn without looking , get into the fast lane and drive 20 below the limit , stomp on the brakes and come to a virtual stop at the speed cameras . I can go on and on but I dont wan na stay here all night to describe just how horrible car drivers in qatar are .

i like editors ;--RRB- i can understand that ; - -RRB-
Maybe I will check one of those places out then . Thanks for the input .
The Pearl has some nice restaurants by the way . Not the nightclub at the Marriott , I mean THE Pearl . Bit pricey but you can get a nice bottle of wine and sit in Dubai-esq surroundings , nice atmosphere and food in some places is nice . Thought I should contribute something to here other than sarcasm .
Thanks Qhris . Some wine and a walk around the water sounds like it could be a lot of fun , actually .
irish club ??? maybe he has a problem with irish people ; -RRB-
Irish and Scots are on good terms . McD + O'xxx = ??
McDO'olahan ?
eat . . kitchen/restaurant socialize . . FB/QL : D
Clever response .
There are loads of places to go . But if you are on your own they are not much fun . I guess the easy response would be somewhere like the Qube Night Club at Ramada . You may at least bump into people and get chatting at the bar there .
Irish Pub , Pearl Lounge , Qube , Waterhole , Paloma etc. . for socialising

How about exploring the unexplored areas around the Industrial area . Will be one hell of a memorable experience
Pearl Qatar or Villagio
u can go to corniche , boating , museum , family park .
Departure Lounge at the airport

The new museum of Islamic arts is worth a look . After that go to Golf Club for a beer & a burger .

There is one more outlet at the petrol station near the zoo opposite the Hyatt Plaza . Cheers

~ 300 meter on B ring from Sana'a to crazy traffic lights
there is one near sana r/a along B-ring road . besides the new KFC store .
there is one opposite hyatt , there is also one in abu hamour petrol station .
Theres a new one at the Bluewater Shopping Centre Just eat another doughnut if you cant get a pie
Wow ... where do I start ... haha Give us some more information , what year ? Model ? From the dealer or 2nd hand ? Then , I can tell you more !
Not a good buy . I would never recommend it even as a second car for off road activity .
All Ammrican cars have bad resale value in Qatar . You should expect to loose around 30 % to 35 % on the cost of the car in the first year .
I had a Jeep not so long ago and I pleased to say ` Goodbye '
Hasan is right on the resale value . The 4-door wrangler should do you fine as a daily driver and work out for camping trips . I guess you got ta love the car if you 're going to buy an older one . Either way , good luck finding a car that suits you !
Id watch out if i were you in regards to the resale value for sure in addition , i prefer the older engines , 2004 and down if im not mistaken . the 4.0 ? the new 3.7 feels so tied up while flooring it . dam all the eco constraints theyre enforcing on the big boy cars nowadays conclusion : if you want it for an everyday car , then dont want it that much , you could do better if you are into poping the bonnet every now and then and enjoy it , go for it -LRB- preferably older -RRB- as mentioned in previous threads
I follow carefully reports and reviews on cars regarding durability , maintenance and reliability . To be honest , Dodge and Chrysler -LRB- including Jeep -RRB- are among the least reliable cars around . A recent study by Forbes in the USA shows that these manufacturers along with GMC top their list of least reliable cars . A list which no Japanese or Korean manufacturer made ! Interestingly , cars manufactured by FORD for the past five years are among the most reliable . Jeeps have been well known for their mountain and dune climbing capabilities , but when it comes to road driving , you 'd better slow down before buying one and see all other alternatives . A Ford Explorer may be a good choice if you are looking for an American car at the same price tag -LRB- or even cheaper -RRB- than the Jeep . But for Qatar , if you can , get your self one of these : 1 - Toyota Prado . 2 - Nissan Pathfinder or X-Terra 3 - Mitsubishi Pajero 4 - Honda Pilot They are the least to lose at reselling by order . They are also very reliable and have a large range of options to choose from .
Overplay.net Prices are on the site , think I pay 30 dollars for 3 months or something . Works well and can log on to any country , handy for us irish - UK and Irish TV players .
Hi , I would recommend using http://www.RoadWarriorVPN.com The service is excellent and guys are very responsive . Them them out !
Ive been using www.laptoptelly.com in Qatar early on in the year . had pretty good speed and quick links to BBC & ITV . think was fiver a month or something .
ask Mr. Google , there are lots of reviews online . just find time reading it . HTH
definetly LG
The best-rated front loader in the reviews we found is the LG SteamWasher WM3875HWCA , which receives very good to excellent marks in professional tests for cleaning performance , efficiency and gentleness on clothing . Price : # 1.150 http://www.consumersearch.com/washing-machine-reviews
One of the famous names is Fair & Lovely , you can get it from all major stores . Good Luck
Dear Friends , , No other recomendation ? / ? pls ???
You can used eskinol clear and let it dry followed by tsing tsang su . its effective.You can buy it to any supermarket . Goodluck
you can used also magic cream and astringent during night time or daytime also but not expose to sunlight when applying this stuff
i know of one special formula and its effective . dont know if the ingredients are here in qatar but I can teach you .
MY FRIEND , THE BEST IS GO TO DERMATOLOGIST AND EXAMINE YOUR FACE SENSITIVITY . YOU MAY APPLY A LOT OF FACIAL CREAM AND YOUR FACE MIGHT REACT ON IT DIFFERENTLY . SOME ARE CHEAP AND SOME ARE EXPENSIVE BUT MUST BE SURE FIRST OF YOUR SKIN PROPERTIES BEFORE APPLYING ON IT .
TRY ... TEA TREE FROM BODY SHOP
You are quite a brave man to ask this question . However , since you are a Qatari , I do n't think that there is any cream that can turn you inot an Ammerican .
All you have to do is to take ur RESUME -LRB- CV -RRB- to Hamad Hospital Human Resources Department they will gv u a form to fill then u submit . Wish u good luck cheers ...

Thank you for your help
one shop in shahra kaharaba just opposite to damas jewellery and before bombay silk center
Just try in the shops inside Al Waqif Souq near Arab Round About ...
In Souk Wakif , you have an exclusive shop which sells Honey . It is along side with the shops which sells spices . It is really very good . I have tried it .
From any Drugstore .
south of france , spain .
If I am not mistaken , they are around 2500 - 2700 riyals in Doha for 16gb . . This was from while ago , so prices may have changed - if u do a search on qatar living u can find ur answer ! good luck
Thanks chmb . So it means I 'd be better off bringing from the States ? mainly because it would be cheaper , is that correct ?
if you get a phone from australia , it is factory unlocked ... i guess thats the best option . and a new 3GS 32 GB should cost you just Qr3100 brand new .
No probs Uzee , yeah , i think getting from the US would be cheaper , and it can be unlocked here for 150-200 riyals i think . .
also you can use wifi to get skype application and use skype calling for free . The new palm is pretty cool too
@crazyjoy , find me a 32GB factory unlocked 3GS in Qatar and I 'll buy 10 . The cheapest I 've seen so far is Starlink at 3,800 and also seen them for 3,100 in HongKong . If you bought it for 3,100 then there 's delivery , risk of customs tax , and/or dam

I thought it was asked in a manner that suggested a desire for titillation rather than information . Perhaps that was the impetus for the removal by the moderator . Mandi
ann summers suppose to open at the city centre when we arrived in Doha 2001 . I saw the shops name at the mall directory . I guess it did not go very far ...
As we say . dont ask the question ... if you dont want the real answer , can you handle they truth ?? It is always the lost that need my guidance
We had that done at a relatives house here . it wasnt the entire ceremony as there are restrictions to that and not possible to bring in a priest so it was a simple ceremony but we got registerd at the embassy legalising it .
That clears a lot of things . I was specifically talking about the Qatari family court . Some expat communities in Qatar have some kind of marriage officials over here , whether it is at their embassies or outside . In my case , since my wife and I are of different nationalities , we could not get married at the embassy .
IchWill - some laws in this country just amaze me . different rules for diff nationalities for the same issue . at the end of the day it all boils down to money ... dont understand why they cant just take the cash and make things simpler !!!!
As far as the family court is concerned only one law applies to all nationalities . They genuinely did not care what our nationalities were . They only care about religion ... I am not saying that is any better .
Ichwill - yeah that too ... case to case scenario actually . in this instance yes its religion but there are many other issues pertaining to visas etc and every nationality has something diff to produce . believe me the ppl sitting at the counters themselves have differing opinions on what papaers need to be submitted for what ... recent hair raising exp with my labour card ... & ^ & & %
i know ... plz dont remind me ... im yet to get out of that nightmare and thank god i have it done now ... :--LRB- but yes one good thing that came out of that nightmare is now i KNOW the exact procedure -LRB- as long as they dont change anything in the next 24hrs ! -RRB- ... : - -RRB-
Britey - if u cud sue them i wud ... can not ... :--LRB- -LRB- i wish they had tied me down with chains and refused to sign that blessed paper ... :--LRB- -LRB- IchWill - this rule is for those who have diff sponsors . Reason being the sponsor is responsible for his employee .
It is a violation of a basic human right . Responsibility or not . The freedom of choice of a partner is not available in this country . It is , indeed , modern slavery again .
LP - tell me something new . most things in this blessed place is a violation of basich human rights and freedom . Modern day slavery at its best Vision - ur welcome . :-RRB- and congratulations - one more bites the dust ... : p
britexpat ; yes , someone who was employed by a company here and on a seperate RP . Employer / Sponsor has NOTHING to do with marriage of employee . Provided both bride and groom have valid RPs in Qatar , the family court in Qatar will only ask for a letter of approval from the father of the bride if he is not physically present in the court during the wedding , and an attested/translated civic record or something that proves the bride is not married . In addition to doing a medical test and bringing 2 witnesses to court , there is nothing else to it . However , keep in mind that the family court here will only marry a Muslim male to a Muslim or Christian female . They will not carry out the marriage of the groom is not a Muslim or if the bride is not a Muslim nor Christian . Only one exception to this rule : Female cabin crew working at Qatar Airways .
Yes Ichwill i did get married here according to our religious rites and then had to get a formal one done at our embassy and submitted the NOC to my embassy and attested it . when i had my child here i had to submit a similar letter stating i was sponsored by my company to HMC ...
britey - that happens when both have diff sponsors ... i had to give one too many yrs back .
Well QL teaches us something new every day . . Why should the company care who you marry ? What if they said No ? Anyway , i do n't want to hijack his post . . Visionint : Good Luck
do n't you tinks ;-P Wish that your company never issued NOC ?
Xena - dont remind me ... ;--LRB- -LRB-
I agree with Tinkerbell10 . A colleague of mine had a similar issue and had to get an NOC . I did wonder myself at that point in time why this was necessary . But now I understand it is because of the difference in Sponsors .
funny lol
I heard some pretty disgusting stuff in the gulf but that is in the top 10 . Slaves have to get permission to get married . What is this ? The 7th century ? That is just sick
To whom it may concern Mr. X was married to me for xx years and performed his duties to the best of his abilities . I have no objection to him entering into another marriage contract . Regards Mrs. X

a south indian grocery store
Safari Mole
The one near my 20 is good too.A very good indian guy , he has everything that you need.its a Supermarket but a bit smaller , i mean a lot smaller .
Carrefour , Spinneys and Foodworld Choice . I really enjoy shopping at Foodworld Choice . They really have a very friendly and clean shopping environment . And their Customer Service is excellent which you can not find in other supermarkets like Lulu and Safari . Although some items are expensive they make it sure they have the highest quality of the product.And they have imported items from UK and USA .
Do you know if they have an organic greenbox ?
<B> No advertising please <b>
ok TFS
i am wondering why no one said LULU ?
Shop Rite , Spinneys and the supermart at Parco Mall -LRB- forgot the name -RRB- .
All supermarkets in Doha are poorly managed . Too many times I read `` sorry , we are out of stock . '' Guess , they 've never heard of proper PLANNING . Bloody amateurs wherever you look .
The greenbox stuff is pretty good . you can have locally grown -LRB- I think -RRB- and imported . The good thing about them is that they take care that their produce is not left in the heat and immediately distributed , so it really is fresh .
Spinneys appears to treat their staff well or at least provide them with adequate training as most of them are very sociable , friendly and appear to genuinely smile at you . Something new in Doha !

There is no separate quota for Russians but yes she can find a job here
there are many jobs for ladies but i think she will face problum in getting VISA as she is single . -LRB- no VISA class for GF in Qatar -RRB- . unless she applied for some peramadical staff which dont requied any blood relation or husband to be here in Qatar . or if your goin marry soon then she can have many options .
It 's quite hard to get work visa for single ladies these days unless your employer is one of the Q companies . Our company tried to hire single ladies for office administration jobs but found it hard to get a work visa for them . Finally settled on hiring husband sponsored ladies . I also heard some single lady teacher assistants in some private schools unfortunately were let go because of the same situation and had to be replaced also with ladies with husband-sponsored visas . But you can try your luck .
yes they are at both Virgin megastore locations .
i believe so , you can find them at Virgin Megastores . thats where i bought them .

Back when i was in Philippines , i sell authentic skullcandy from US at a much lower price . I have to find courier here in Qatar which i can send my orders from US .

100 QR , and the traffic department only accepts debit card or visa card . they do not accept cash .

Hi Johanna and welcome . Maid 's salaries run from 1200 QR on up for live-in , 25-35 QR an hour for live-out . Come to the Mums in Doha or the Expatwoman coffee mornings at Villagio and you will have all your questions answered ! Mandi
Maid 's salaries run from 600 QR on up for live-in ...
Not for westerners bleu they corrupt the Market !
Hi Mandi thank you so much it will be great .
People do n't get paid what they deserve they get paid what they negotiate . It may not be fair but it 's the truth
400 $ is a bit too much . If you add to this 400 $ maid 's accommodation , let 's say a room 3500QAR -LRB- 1000 $ -RRB- , then her food about $ 200 , then her cloths , etc , about another $ 100-200 . . ops . . it comes to over QAR6000 ... than it turns that the office clerk makes less then maid ? ... <i> <b> ********************* `` What lies behind us and what lies before us are small compared to what lies within us .

I agree with you Alumnar . You can not treat someone like a slave ... If you want a job doing right you have to pay and look after them properly ...
... people seem to not realize that when they take somebody on and this person lives with them , this person becomes part of not only your household but also your family . You trust them with your lifes and belongings , and most important with your children . That comes at a price , and the price I mentioned is VERY fair !
I pay according to experience , competence and professionalism rather than nationality . Mandi

with 2 small kids ? better not ...
People here move away in summer & u planning to move in here ???!! who initiated this idea ??!! :D wel . . dont trouble yourself to get into more trouble here ... it was 48degrees yesterday & may reach above 50degree later , , nothing unusual for Qatar !
Chooose some cold place , Qatar is not right place to VISIT in Summer .
It 's my partner idea he wrks there and wants us to cum out for the summer to him i dont no what to do , i have being there before on my own and with my oldest boy who is 6 years , it was very hot when we were there alrite , i did ' t like where we were staying out in alkor , if we go for the summer we would be staying in doha , i just dnt no what to do becoz my baby is only 8 months and being from ireland we are use to the rain ha ha !!!!
Dear Helena , I m in Doha since 15 days , my family -LRB- wife and my 6 y.o boy , supposed to arrive on 15 days -RRB- I am actually trying to convive my wife to come as late as she will , because the temperature is realy bad -LRB- yesterady 48 on my area -RRB- ... Prepare to suffer ... .
Bring chiller if you do n't like hot water bath .
bad idea ... as you said you have an 8 months old baby then it will be useless to spend summer here ... bcoz you will have to stay at home all the time with kids in the A/C ... secondly you stay in Al-Khor and its a boring place . . atleast in doha city a person never gets bored . . anyways all of us gave you our suggestions and the rest depends on you ... if you still plan to spend summer vaccations then you are welcome ... how long your hubby has been staying here ?
thanks for all the answers , he is there nearly 8 months , i no it is going to be very hot thats what is putting me off about going out for the summer with the kids , anyways i 'm just going to have to make my mind up soon ha!thanks for the help
Not a good idea at all . Most mums going home with the kids , playgroup and coffee morning shuts . Very hot to go outdoor . Your life will confine house - car - shops
Would be too hat to walk or sit in any place without A/C you and your family will spend all day in one of the Malls and that is it
do you know the summer here today its hell 47c here . arrrrrrrrrgh
It would be very hot I guess . . and in the later summer months a lot of humidity for the icing on the cake ... !!! This is my first summer here as well ... but thats what I heard from my friends here , who are here for the past few years ...
Yes you can . .
There have n't been enough cases for them to collaborate statistics on which cultures are more prone to being infected . An no , I highly doubt Asians , or those who eat those types of food have any particular immunity to it . It is very similar to the common cold , however because it is new , no one has an immunity to it because no one has ever been exposed to it before . The best you can do is eat healthily and provide your body with adequate nutrition so that your immune system is as strong as it can be to fight it off .

D-Link make a USB wifi receiver . Available at Sofitel .
Any PCI wireless Card would do the job for you . there are many brands available in the market . Linksys , Belkin and D-Link . . and it costs around 100QR . hope it helps :-RRB- Happy Browsing ; -RRB-
The best USB Wireless Adapter is Linksys PCI wireless adapter is not recommendable the advantage of using USB wifi adapter is , you can also use a 5 metres of USB Cable to put the adapter in an appropriate place where the receiption is gud .
You have to purchase a USB Adapter that you can put in your desktop USB slot , brand name like Linksys or Dlink . It is available at any electronic section of carryfour or Lulu . Price may vary from QR 99 - Qr 120 of better go at sofitel where prices are very cheap . Hope this information had help you !
Very well said valleyofdevils . : -RRB-
Many thanks for all ... ... I think I can solve the problem
I think the D-link or Linsky devices will be cheaper in the shops at Rayyan Road compared to the shops in Sofitel Complex .
The salary is too less .
People need to stop taking these low paid jobs . I understand that it probably is an opportunity to learn and gain more experience , but that is a very low salary and it 's time people started saying `` no , thank you '' to offers like this . It upsets me that someone even thinks it 's okay to offer someone that level of salary in Qatar .
Hi Everyone !! Thanks for all your response . Cheers !
maybe you can ask for more . .

hey , is your husband 's name not mentioned in your passport , just flash that .
No his name is not mentioned in my passport . Thanks anyways . I wondering if it will be easier to book in a smaller or bigger hotel . And i guess it much depends on the person standing in the reception at the time if they will let him in or not .
Thanks to you all for your advice , we are planning to stay at the Mvenpick Tower Hotel since it is very close to City centre mall so I just have to wish they will not ask . And if they will we have to take it from there . We are married but does not have a marriage certificate with stamp .
I do not want to hide anything , I am not that kind of person . If it is ment that he will be able to stay with me then it is ment if not then this is something that we just have to accept . We have been married for less then a year .
you 're a good trooper gypsy for sharing your own experience . Just act like you know what you 're doing and no problem .
Check in as single into two different rooms ;-RRB- then invite your spouse for a bottle of wine ... play some good music ... etc. .
even if he is not a qatari citizen , he can apply a tourist visa for you . the only thing he will do is to ask any of the travel agency here in doha and apply a tourist visa for you which is valid for 15 days up to maximum of 30 days . your passport is the only requirements .
i smell some fishy business here .
Let him pay for his pleasure !
Girl , if he is really a qatari he is the first one who should know ; he has all the resources to get you one .
Dears , Its a matter of support what these companies are getting in based country ; as well as there own resources ; however I experienced FedEx excellent in UAE , as well as DHL here in Qatar . ARAMEX , no idea Sorry .
Writing my experience with all of them , , I found DHL best in sending Time Sensative Documents . . !! Moreover , as per my conversation with one of the Managers in DHL -LRB- who is also my friend -RRB- told me , the pressure is much less due to lack of business in recessions . . so , this makes me sure that their service will be better & faster as none of your things would be queued or neglected .
-LRB- Dalsey , Hillblom and Lynn -RRB- DHL ... -LRB- period -RRB-
I 've sent n received too many times with all of them.Each time i experienced to send sensetive papers as you meantioned.But what I noticed that DHL is the fastest one incase you have limited time n hurry for something . And as a personal view I say all are safe enough and well servicing.The worse thing is ; you have to pick up ur stuff from their office after they informed u that you have a shipment.Would be better if they could delivery at the door . wish you the best .
well i dont know about others but found DHL good always as i only have used DHL always .
My choice is DHL
Although I have tried Aramex for Auto parts , I still prefer DHL or Fed Ex . They can all deliver door-to-door . I was not very impressed with Aramex 's delivery time .
me and my wife would use aramex to send documents for our distance educ classes based in australia . we chose aramex over DHL because of the pricing they give . they can deliver it quickly enough , though of course dhl and fedex -LSB- or ups -RSB- are better at that . but with pricing , i 'd say aramex . for documents that is . but with jewelries or gadgets , etc , im not really sure i 'd chose aramex to deliver those for me .
... no objection letter for ? Driving license ? Employment ?
Hi Alumnar , `` because im under family visit visa . . objection letter for employment ... thanks for the reply ''
or No objection letter ?
yeah No objection letter sory . . thanks for the reply i just need the format as my guide coz my husband is making me one
do you need the no objection letter to transfer your sponsorship to a company ?
persons under visit visa are not allowed to work in Doha .
A letter from him with his name , address , passport number , visa number stating that he allows you , name , passport number , family visa number to work for company ABC . That is basically it .
Hi Alumnar , `` because im under family visit visa . . objection letter for employment ... thanks for the reply ''
You need a release letter from whoever is sponsoring your visit here . The rest is all up to the company who is taking you on . If your visit sponsor is a philippino person please check directly with the Philippino Embassy -LRB- give them a call in the morning -RRB- , they will give you the exact information the letter needs to have .
bianne . I have sent to your email the format of the letter , make sure that the company is a good company . Before you give the no objection letter , it is better to ask for the acceptance letter from the company . = = = = Alumnar , you have an impeccable character . I 'll apply to join your group .

There 's no Ikea in Doha . They 've been playing with plans of opening one up for years . Closest is in Dubai . I just came from there today . They will ship your purchases to Doha , but you have to go there in person and buy the stuff . Delivery time is 5-7 days . The price is 3.7 Dirham per kg , but a minimum fee of 300 Dihram . Worth it , if you buy a lot . Supposedly there 's a catch my friends told me about AFTER I got back from Dubai -LRB- I 'm currently looking for new friends ;-RRB- -RRB- . The weight price they quote is not just regular kg 's , but kg in terms of volume . In essence they said you can expect to pay twice of what they 've quoted you . But , I guess I 'll know the exact answer to that in 5-7 days , when my goods arrive . If everything seems under control , you 're just not going fast enough ...
Ikea no , but CRAP from equal quality is easy to find .
No there is n't any Target or WalMart or anything like that . There are not really any American chain stores . -LRB- Ca n't speak for Canadian stores as I have never been to Canada -RRB- There are a few UK department stores .

First u should complet 2 years with the previous company to have right in changing sponsorship otherwise u can get 6 months -LRB- IAARA -RRB- . awaiting for the 2 years to be complet then u can change sponsorship . best of luck .
I think coyboy , emy and translator is correct . You can get the Iaara till you complete two years .
Iaara not acceptable . Any other opton ?
If Iyara na possible , then exit Qatar and come back with the new visa , you mentioned they 've give you an NOC . Simple as that !
Follow mccoyvq 's idea . Exit Qatar & come back with new visa . u have NOC in hand . Gudluck .
Yes as long as you have a NOC letter from your previous Employer !
No you cant until unless you complete 2 years . then only you can transfer sponsorship . But you have option that you can take 6 months `` YARA '' or `` VARA '' I do n't know the exact word . but your company Madoop -LRB- PRO -RRB- knows very well . By this procedure you can legally work for new company . After completing 2 years you can transfer sponsorship permanently . All the Best .
As coyboy2k12 mentioned , you can take I3ara `` Borrowing '' for 6 months , and after the 2 years they can transfer the sponsorship .

well 2 bed rooms flat can start from 4500 Q.R around 1230 US $ , the maximum it can goes up to 50000 Q.R u have to communicate and apply for the university online so at least u can ask about admission and so . u should also take an idea about the tutuions as education is expinsive in the area .
Do a search on QL and you would see that it is really expensive . an example , I 'm paying 17500 rials for a 4 bedroom apartment

Are you crazy ? One you are Iranian and it 's hard to get visa , second it 's very expensive here and no way could you sponsor your family to come . Unless your family is very rich and you buy your way in

dont get married . you might regret it later !
Your boy friend who is egyptian should ask his embassy as you did and asked your embassy . For your information the egyptian emabssy does not register foreign marriage here in qatar . you have an option to go to normal islamic marriage here in qatar and get a marriage certificate from qatari authorities submit it to the egyptian embassy then they will give you a visit visa to Egypt accompanied with your husband . than go to egypt and register your marriage in Egypt all the best and good luck .
first of all he is agree to marry you ? go with him to consult with your embassy first then qatar authoriti certificates in order to . . follow the planning man advise
think many many times before you get married to other nationalities and different religion as the others said you might regret it someday ! The phil embassy will not marry you , sorry for that but you might find another legal way . goodluck !
i have the same case and interested to know about muslim-christian marriages . though i am satisfied and happy with my relationship with my egyptian boyfriend , i also advise you think about this a lot of times before deciding to marry him ... and make sure that he is not married in egypt , he may be seem like the perfect man but as you know , some people are deceiving .

When on the Qtel website looking at TV packages , it states in small print that that cost of each package includes basic 1mb and landline . Had mine installed the other week . I think many people , including myself have to have the basic 250QR package installed then can update once installed . I expected the internet to be appalling but it actually isnt that bad ! When streaming UK sites through my VPN connection , it runs smoothly and does not cut out . I 've added the sports channels now but to be fair , even if you paid top dollar for all the tv channels , the vast majority of them are pretty naff .
cheers ben . think i 'd better find a place to live before i worry about internet providers ! Every place seems to be full ! The search goes on and on .
Wow paki_bacha80 , how did you manage to find that information so quickly ?
There is a full package available for 250QR and if you need additional channels , then you have to choose and pay for them separately .

TO GET FAMILY VISA HE NEEDS TO SHOW HIS MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE AND OTHER RELATED DOC . AFTER MARRIAGE HE CAN BRING HIS WIFE ON VISIT.AFTER ENTERING SPOUSE NAME ON PASSPORT . AFTER HIS WIFE COMING FOR VISITING IF HE HAS QATAR RIYAL 7000 HE WIL GET FAMILY VISA . AS MUCH AS I KNOW .
A would-be wife can not be considered to have a Family Visa . After marriage , only then that the Immigration will consider his would-be wife under family status upon submission of the Marriage Certificate . Your friend must wait then .
Dear Proposer , In normal case , you friend will need to have a short wait where he completes the paperworks for his wife to join him . Yes , there 's a way if he wants his wife to come along with him . His marriage is on June '09 -LRB- ie the custom or social marriage -RRB- . But he could go for a court marriage at an earlier date , and be legally married -LRB- if not socially -RRB- . He could then submit all the necessary papers and get his wife 's visa well in advance -LRB- of course , if he meets other criterion -RRB-

To my understanding there is a Sailing club in the Ritz-Carlton / Diplomatic club area . You might want to try it in there . As per Jetskiing may be go aside to Intercon and there you can rent a jetski either for 1/2 hr or 1 hr and have some fun . Best of luck ... regards
When I visited Doha I 've been at the Sailing Club and it is really cheap compared to European costs . For about 2000 QR per year you can access to the Club and use the Lasers and 470 boats . I suppose they can offer also lessons , but with the quite wind that blow in Doha it is really easy to learn . Actually I hate the noisy and polluted jet sky , so my suggestion is lear to sail and you will never live without . Cheers from Italy !
Sasuke , where is that Sailing Club ? Is the one at the Diplomatic Club or another one ?
The Doha Sailing club is located when you come from the Mariott back to Doha , it is the first gate on your right on the mainroad , immediately after the Mariott roundabout . Go down to the clubhouse & inquire there . -LRB- Big parking in front -RRB-
I agree with other posts the Doha Sailing club is great - nice idea to leave the Jet skis at home

. . it is . . . . though , a very tight one . . a car can pass through on either side . . does that make it ok . . ? . . . . still , the question remains - what to do , yanni . . ? ...
You park your car in the middle of the road sooner or later you 'll be obstructing others . Some people are just too lazy to use even their common sense .
This is a violation I think people who deliberately do this is a very selfish person . This often happens here , but that does not mean we can not do something to give a lesson to them . take a picture or video and report it to police .
. . we already tried the `` legal '' and proper means to address the situation . . . . a phone call to MOI Traffic Department was made and received a reply of `` go to moroor and report there '' . . or may be we dialled the wrong number from the website . . ? . . . . we figured we 'd just manage the situation ourselves by being blind to the situation . . . . @drsam , posting it here was a result of frustration . . please , try to avoid assuming that all people are too quick to `` insult or publicly denounce '' an OFFENDER -LRB- your words -RRB- . . . . any better suggestions . . ? . . @brit , i ca n't help but agree . . tiidas rule . . especially in our area where there 's so many of them . . c '' , -RRB-
Paying fine is not enough , people who do this should be jailed then maybe they will learn .

You are banned ! If you did the honourable thing a resigned here you * might * have got an NOC and been able to return . As it is , see you in 16 months ... <aÂ href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3262305312/Â title=MonotoneÂ MIAÂ byÂ baldrick2dogs,Â onÂ Flickr> <imgÂ src=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3389/3262305312_f781590578_m.jpgÂ width=240Â height=97Â alt=MonotoneÂ MIAÂ /> </a>
Thanx for the reply sir . i arrived in Qatar last March 17 2007 . just in case i dont have the NOC , can i still go this March 2009 ? TIA
No , it is not from the date you entered Qatar but from the date you officially left . As you didnt cancel your RP that date will probably start 6 months after you left the country as your RP will be automatically cancelled if you are out of Qatar for more than 6 months . _____________________________________________________ `` Diplomacy is the art of saying ` Nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers ''
You will most likely be banned from whenever -LRB- if at all -RRB- your previous sponsor cancelled your visa , which , if you were there 8 months will probably mean he canceeled your visa in November/December07 so you still have a good year to go . <aÂ href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3262305312/Â title=MonotoneÂ MIAÂ byÂ baldrick2dogs,Â onÂ Flickr> <imgÂ src=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3389/3262305312_f781590578_m.jpgÂ width=240Â height=97Â alt=MonotoneÂ MIAÂ /> </a>

where can i buy salicylic acid . ? is there a need for prescription ?
U can use Doufilm solution on it . . two or three times per day.it will go easily.it is available in pharmacies ans does n't need prescription .
If you can chill it real cold ... they die ... you may use the heat approach also ... but thats more painful . Put an ice cube on it for say 15 minutes ... press hard .

just went yesterday for finger printing for my wife . its along salwa road . after industrial r/a just before clover leaf flyover . turn right before the clover leaf flyover and you will see on the right side ministry of interior where you can get your finger print . you can check this also in google map . there 's another area which you can get your finger print . its located in industrial area . if your going to salwa road from industrial area , before the last r/a take the road on the right side and a few meters you will see the office of CEID where you can get finger printing . It is better to take the first area since processing is faster .
Thanks for your info Mr. Dumlao , is highly appreciated .

Hi travieso , I am in a very similair position to you in regards to employment with Aspetar . What did you decide to do in the end and what swayed you in making that decision ?
Hi AngelinaBallerina , What is the staff accomodation provided by Aspetar like ? Do u get a choice of accomodation or is it more or less handed out ? Is there also a half decent social scence happening there as well ? Thanks in advance
personal expperience stay clear , it is a snake pit .
I know a Canadian physio who used to work there . she hated it and left . I was interviewed there 2 years ago , was told I got the job and they subsequently gave the job to someone else -LRB- cheaper , less experienced -RRB- and the place fell apart .

Honestly - do n't bother calling as they will never answer ! Forget fax and email as well ! You have to go down in person to the Animal Resource Department on Airport Road and talk to someone there . They 're open between 6.30 am and 1.30 pm Sunday - Thursday . If it 's one or two cats they will lend you traps that you can set , trap the cats and take in before 10am for neutering . They can be collected the following morning and you can re-release them into your area If it 's a large population then they will probably arange to come and trap them themselves and release them .
Chelsea Thank you for that info - we also have a major cat problem on our compound and I need to get hold of them but I work -LRB- and they really wo n't give me time off to go to the Animal welfare place -RRB- . You do n't happen to know if they are open a little later in the day ? Many thanks J

is there a shop here with exotic animals ? how can i bring them to my country ?
there is no particular shop for such animals but you can find something strange from time to time or by luck in any of the pet shops , thats why the prices are a bit high . and Leiza , there are many different kinds and sizes of snakes . you could start with one that does n't grow much . have to handle them regularly so they get use to it and then chances of biting is very less .
most of the snakes here are illegally brought from dubai or bahrain . I hav n't found any snake with documents here ! for export or import you need a licence for them which I think the goverment has a restriction .
You plonker . . We usually call these type - The Pajju Ants -LRB- Antus Lungiitus -RRB- They usually appear at feast time and then disappear . .
are they robots too like QL user exotic girl 3 : P
how 'd you handle all that animals ?
well its not that difficult if you have some knowledge about them and its my hobby !

hi rizks , no problems ! I am not sure about being legal or not but they are openly sold at some shops ...
I use to get it from the pet shop guys , they catch some for me , but now due to colder weather approaching they will be hard to find , so alternate are chicks and hamsters .
Angus logitus hahaha . good one .
Is it open again ?
I quite some time ago with cigarette smoking . Side effects were minimal .
I like Girls who know how to smoke .
i did . . side effect ?? i diverted into food . . now im turning into cow . .
I didnt smoke since yesterday.May be its the heat . Dont feel like smoking anymore .
The only thing you need to stop smoking is Courage . giving up on anything is not easy . But a brave heart guys/girls can stop smoking if they really want to . it is just a habbit which you engaged with . and Habbits can be changed . Train yourself . First prepare your mind . If your mind is healthy then anything is possible dude . I stoppped smoking . And I really feel great about myself . coz I am not slave of my habbits .
Smokers does n't quit and Quitters does n't smoke
Absolutely no side effects . I am still smoking .
Absolutely no side effects.I quite smoking three years before .
@newtaxi :D hahahhaha i also quit for more than 4hrz :P now its time to ... :P ; - -RRB-
Yes , i did ! but i sneak in a cigg or two in a week !
NO SIDE EFFECTS AT ALL !
keep smoking and kill yourself ... and take others with you as well .
i smoked for almost 24 years and when my daughter asked me why I smoke . . i ca n't provide any good reason why . . so i decided to quit and I never regretted it .

We are very glad to inform you that ur own Gerry 's grill is opening shortly in Doha . . by our hospitality group named as SAVY . . who has taken the franchise from Philipines . . the address is Al Nasr Street opp to FFC in Doh Qatar . . Thanks . .
yes , there will be a Gerry 's Grill in Doha which will be opened sometime September/October 2012 . hope to hang-out there : -RRB-
hi Archie , hello All ya , it is actually October now and I am still waiting for Gerry 's Grill to open . Hope together with Octoberfest ! :D I heard their chefs and staff are really the Gerry 's Grill staff from the head office so let 's see . No date yet ... it has FB page that we can follow : https://www.facebook.com/pages/Gerrys-Grill-Qatar/275112475937870 or the Phil site http://www.gerrysgrill.com/ph/?r=1
is it opening ?
Location please ... ???
the birdy , you know that you are teaching how to violate a law of Qatar ? and you want this poor man to commit a crime , and to push his pronsor to commit a crime too . .
May be it is a violation , I agree . But denyng a person to bring his wife -- also a violation of his human rights . what I told him is not a big crime . He is bringing undrs the same sponsor .
gotcha did you try searching on the net before posting ?? I found this http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_meaning_of_arhan Regards !!
yes , i searched on net , it is not clear , in your link its showing the meaning of Arhan or arahan .
To use the same source as the first answer , but with the spelling you gave http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_meaning_of_arhaan Means Ruler , but does not define origin , which my earlier post suggests is Aboriginal not Islamic .
Beloved Brother/Sister , there is no such thing as a ` muslim ' name ; for one is recognized as a believer in the sight of Allah SWT because of his belief and deeds , not because of his name . The meaning of this name is `` ruler '' and it 's origin is Indian . And If one wishes to name their child ` Arhaan ' , it would be a perfectly acceptable name in Islam . If the question was ` is it a good name ? ' , then we would advice that there are plenty of better names one may keep for their children .

How did you find this out . As far as I 'm aware thread authors can not edit other peoples comments . For example , can you edit this comment ?
Only the Moderator has that kind of access ----------------- HE WHO DARES WINS
what we can do is just edit our own comments and nothing more , at least where the main forum is concerned , that is ... :-RRB- <aÂ target=_blankÂ href=http://www.blingcheese.com/> <imgÂ src=http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s235/revmyspace2/graphics/Misc/Smileys/smiley_25009t7y685v0e.gifÂ title=MySpaceÂ CommentsÂ border=0> </a> <br> < a target = '' _ blank '' href = `` http://www.blingchees
thread authors can now edit others peoples comment ??????? hmmm i just check it and its not posible ...

I was just surprised that many of my comments in our group are deleted but when you asked the Admins , they are claiming that it 's the author -LRB- the author is not an admin -RRB- of the thread doing the deletion ! That 's why I am asking for clarifications from the authorities of this site ! ... ... tsk ! tsk ! tsk !

are you insinuating something ? `` ABUSE OF POWER '' sort of ... hmmmmm
I recall one of my Post was deleted from a group after the Manager of that Group suggested that it should be in the main forum . So the Manager of that group just deleted it .

dmigty - you 're more likely to get a response using the contact link . Though I think your question has already been answered by everyone else .
wait for further response ! I 'm talking about my letter to QL Mods , not this thread ! ... ... tsk ! tsk ! tsk ! Ganun pala nangyari sa miting ng mga Heneral !!!!!! `` Do n't let a little dispute injure a great friendship ''
that 's one more :P -LRB- if only knew it was this easy LOL -RRB-
Ok , my bad . Did n't know you 'd written a letter to QL Mods .
I guess they did n't consider it worthy of a response ! I do n't think anyone works on QL full time , so they probably only send a reply to those that really need one .
NO . It 's respect to someone asking question . Are you fun of just disregarding queries ? And by saying nobody works fulltime , are you insinuating that Mods are not doing their work with a little sense of responsibility ? It 's just just !!!!! Lol !!!!!! I do n't think so !!! ... ... tsk ! tsk ! tsk ! Ganun pala nangyari sa miting ng mga Heneral !!!!!! `` Do n't let a little dispute injure a great friendship ''
chill out dude ! All I know is that QL is n't run as a business , and the owners and mods all have their own lives to lead outside of the website , so it 's inevitible that some questions go unanswered and some threads/classifieds go unmoderated . If it 's that important ask them again , though personally I ca n't see that anything to do with QL can be THAT important .
hahahahaha !
or Jungle Zone in Hyatt Plaza ?
YES , AS HIS VISA IS STILL ACTIVE TILL JANUARY , HE CAN COME BACK EVEN IF HE HAS ANY OTHER GCC COUNTRY VISA . BUT ONCE HE WILL BE HERE DEFINITELY THE COMPANY WILL ASK AS HOW HE MANAGED TO GET THE VISA BUT THAT IS NOT A PROBLEM . SO YOUR FRIEND CAN COME ANY TIME BEFORE EXPIRY OF THE RP . THANKS
i would recommend you aspire park , very beautiful and quiet place
inside the Musuem of Islamic Arts ... there 's one spot there facing the sea : -RRB-
aspire park - pearl qatar - cornishe
The Departure Lounge at the Airport ...
ASPIRE AREA
Yeah , as many fellows recommended , aspire park & the Museum of Islamic Art Qatar , both are peaceful , beautiful and appropriate places where one can write with peace of mind ...
Go sport , they should have .
Just googled it thanks
Thaer my friend , it is not the same Arabic at all . And as a learner it is complicated for me to learn with someone Lebanese or Qatari for example . Yes , i am referring to dialect .
am Tunisian living in Doha any time you can contact me 33967933 Nadim it will be with pleasure to share
Arabic is Arabic . You mean you 're looking for someone with a Tunisian Dialect . Just saying .
patience , please ... They will come and do it for you , if you give them some time . But Mozaic is worth the wait :--RRB-
explain !
read the leaflet -LRB- manual -RRB- attached with this packet , then you can solve any issues very easily
tell me man what help you need with thomson or mozaic ?
I know I am bad . And yup I went against the advice . But the theme of the thread still seems to be , that the curry is just as good , if not better in the UK . And back home I live in a sleepy little city that has no Thai , no Lebanese , and no Turkish restaurants . So it 's best to give him food experiences he ca n't get back there .
Aryaas is mid level ... everyday food at low cost . And it 's mainly veg . But if you are in for a good diniing out experience I would n't chose it . There 's Maaza , they do a mean `` Kadai chicken '' . There 's Asiana , not typical Indian food , but it 's OK . Then there is Shalimar for the banana leaf Sadya . Their butter chicken is also good .
How is a restaurant called Aryan or Arias ?
nomerci its Aryas . . It is ok , nothing special . I like their North Indian meal which they served during lunch hours . .
She was damn good about food.Her posts her pics her love for food was more than amazing.I still go through her posts so many times.She is really worth missing .
Safron Restaurant in Katara , doubtless . It might seem expensive compared to other places , but the food and the setting itself are worth the expense .
The best curry house for me is called Spices - round the corner from where we live . They do take out as well as sit in . It is great food .
Did you go or not ?????? What 's the verdict ...
britexpat . . 80 % of the curry houses in the Uk are run by Bangadeshi . Chingari has nice ambient . For value curries Qutba in Bin Dirhem is nice !
Brit I have given up on curry as an idea in Qatar . I have decided that it would be better to look for other food experiences for my son while he is here . As the curry back home is better . So we had Thai today , and it 's going to be Lebanese tomorrow .
TB thats cuz you never listen ! ... Bad TB ... :--LRB- -LRB- You took all our advice and finally ate on a banana leaf !!! ... and cold food that that ! ... serves you right ! ... j/k ... take Cabbages advice and try SPICES . : - -RRB-
B2D !!! Ahhh now that calls for a party !!! ... LOLZ Really nice to see this ... :--RRB- -RRB-
I notice nobody mentioned Aalishaan near Muntazah . Its quite nice and you can order a boneless meat dish . . Enjoy the curries . .
Riz , someone stole my effin F !
lol b2d ! ... Star of India too have some fine curries .
I ordered a boneless curry from Welcome Dine -LRB- behind Sana -RRB- . It came with bones . I do n't eat there any more : oS
Now come to KFC Bin Omran and Pay for the Snack Box and Potato Mesh Gravy I had . . I am inside doing dishes : -LRB-

RofL Khanan ! wait wait he will surely come , make sure you are waiting out of KFC not Inside coz the temperature out if ONLY 47degress ... : -LRB-

Okie Dokes ! ... Rizku - so true - the buffet at Star of india is really good !!! ... B2D - change that keyborad . . it uses the F in all the wrong places ... : D
Went to Saffron once . It was Crap and extremely expensive .
Britey - i went there too - just once ! even though the food seemed OK i was feeling so conscious cuz of the ever so nice waiters who were hovering around me all the time and i hate that !!!! Its basically for the local qataris who love indian food and have the cash to pay for it ...
britey can u take me to Saffron ? :-LRB- We can have Hot Milk with Saffron mix in it over there ... : -RRB-
Let 's go to a decent restaurant . . i 'll bring the hot Milk and Saffron :O -RRB-
@ britexpat , the stuff i ate @ Saffron was pretty good but yes bloody expensive & portions were TINY by Indian standards ... all style no substance , story of this town really , for the most case ! :-RRB- ...
It is ungreatfull for any body to say all this . You guys have come here not because you did not know the weather , the rules or what ever , the fact is all of us have come here because you earn so much more and you have high saving potential and that is the only thing that brings you here . My friend you also are moving from your home country to Doha not for any thing but the money you are offered , and now please understand to gain some thing you defenitely have to sacrifice some thing and i do not know what you sacrifice , but it is all for MONEY YOU COME so just decide what you want . It is meaningless to having such debates on this subject . i am sorry guys , i felt like telling the REAL FACT .
You will always be a slave , as this is their policy here . Buy a car ? No , sponsor needed . Open a giro bank account ? No , sponsor required . Bring your wife ? No , sponsor required . Leave for a holiday ? No , sponsor required . And so on and so on . The biggest disadvantage is that water costs twice as much as petrol . You sometimes wish you were a car .
It is drinkable but not advisable .
there are no random shootings or gunmen on the loose .
Too bad you are only looking at the dark side , lol . Climate would be a disadvantage - it 's really hot right now . But many expats have the ability to leave in the summer . Climate is also an advantage - no snow and Christmas dinner outside on the patio . I suppose that drinking water can be a problem depending on where you live . I drink the water out of the tap all the time . Cars - disadvantages include absolutely insane drivers although it has been getting better . An advantage includes cheap gas and the ability to buy a better vehicle than you probably had at home . Social life - disadvantages - you probably will remain within your ethnic group , i 've found it hard to mix and mingle with the Qataris . On the other hand , you will make excellent friends and have the time to socialize with them . Vacation time - only an advantage here . We have almost triple the vacation time we had at home , the money to go places , and you do n't have to travel as far to go to exotic destinations .
You should consult a doctor fist and tell him about your medication . He/she will provide you the necessary prescription or advice .
sorry for the spelling mistake `` fist '' should be `` first ''
you can consult any physicians in any Doha clinics , and have yourself examined , then they would write you the prescription that you need ...
certain medications are controlled by prescriptions , like anti biotics , steroids and psychatric drugs . most others you can avail over the counter , if the drugs is controlled you need to get a prescription
Even for controlled drugs ; you ca n't have a permanent prescription , you have to consult your physician everytime -LRB- frequently at least once in 2 months -RRB- to obtain presecriptions for regular medicine .
lol ... !
i also had the same problem couple of years back . i would suggest a very good homemade recipie which helped me . first thing in the morning as soon as you get up , Squeeze one lime in a glass of warm water add a pinch of salt and drink on empty stomach , do this every morning for at least 15-20 days you 'll start feeling the difference , for the time being apply some JOGEL gel -LRB- available in any pharmacy -RRB- on the ulcers
my brother had it before and it was always coming back ... my mom noticed it was induced of a particular food he takes ... so he avoided that food and it is now okey ... there is a powder called alum . . you can place it in the ulcer area ... it will hurt so much that time then it will help cure the area fast ... before i did n't believe because i know that this alum was used cosmetically until one day i was desperate to find a cure and i tried ... and now i am recommending it . .
Why cant ' t people give a straight answer and recommend a good dentist ?? suddenly everyong has a medical degree and giving advices ... the gentleman asked for a good doctor not how to heal his ulcers . PM at your convienience and i will be happy to discuss your condition
I will try lemon remedy and ya i read about alum is effective on canker sore but alum , omg . thanks for suggestion of all and pm , but still i am searching any answer if anybody suffered and consulted right doctor .
buy listerine mouthwash . gargle at least 4 times a day . within 2-3 days your mouth ulcer will be cured .
Best and simple answer is Drink two glasses of hot water -LRB- equivalent to tea hot -RRB- and drink -LRB- sip by sip like tea -RRB- in the morning empty stomach and in evening after meals before sleep evreyday as long as you can . 100 % effective I was a real sufferer but no more . . try mate ...
Nothing works or it is temporary ... I can bet you all ... drink hot water as hot as tea . . two glasses in morning empty stomach and two glasses in night after dinner ... and feel the difference
dont know exact soluton , , , but heard that berrygoose is good for this ... AVLA ... in hindi ... ... just eat them kacha .
sorry dint read your complete post . You need to check all the carrefours , i am not sure but you can try either Villagio or Landmark , city center not sure . If you can call them and find out will be even better than roaming around but their customer service sux so i had to visit all the places till i got one .
thanks ! yes its all sold out here : -LRB-
check jarir bookstore if they still have stock for the Live . I bought mine from Amazon US . It turned out expensive since I paid ICTQatar to release it to me . Only the standard one was available that time in the local market . But I saw a couple of months ago from Jarir the Live version of WDTV .
check jarir book store in Rayyan
Available in Jarir books salwaroad QR .449
Just ordered mine on Amazon UK . Like you I could n't find any in Qatar .

There is car accesories shop i Tayseer Airport road , have you try that ?
Novita : Yes , I 've tried it . . unfortunately no more :-RRB- ` thanx

Outside is not Qatar . In Qatar there is no professional stuff . It 's either Made in China or , if it 's available , it costs ten times more than in the world market !
I dont think white preys mind being the prey ... :-RRB- Hope someone from your part of the world can help you on this thread or else just run a search , almost all the info would be there .
Prism ... thats only old white preys with a pot belly and a villa for himself . . loooool
I have been shopping for clothes today , as I believe they can be a little more expensive out there ? I do not take any medicines really but should I looks to get vaccinations before I make the move ? so last minute its unbelievable . By the sounds of it , I can get most things out there , so I am looking forward to making the move .
bring along your car and your flat cause , you may be able to find a good car after a while but a flat/aapartments are a bit expensive so bring your flat , lol
You wo n't get any professional stuff in Qatar whatever it may be .
I have tried to catalog my wife 's and my experiences of moving here at http://waggingthedog.wordpress.com/category/qatar/ Please let me know if it helps .
You get almost everything here . . no need to worry . . dont pack any winter clothes . . maybe couple of light jackets . . winter is very mild compared to Uk . If you are taking some medicines its better to bring it as you may not find the same brand ... same applies for any particular brand of toiletries . Other than work mates , it takes time to make friends here be active on QL , you will find like minded peopleIf its your first time in the Middle east . . please be little cautious about over friendly girls from a particular countrythey are just waiting for a white prey . . lol
You get almost nothing here . I tried to find fretwire for my Adamas guitar . Not available . Ordered it from the US . I tried to get an HD capture card for my PC . Not available , ordered it from Australia . I tried to get an HD satellite receiver PCIexpress card . Not available , ordered it from Germany . If you need professional gear you are fukced in Qatar !
LP we are talking about Ordinary people with ordinary requirements . .
a picture of a spaced out hippy on magic mushrooms dancing on top of a mountain have to do with the question ?
Failures are stepping stones to success -LRB- at least that is what I tried to convince my dad when I failed hindi -RRB- :--LRB- To me not trying is the sign of a loser ; - -RRB-
failing is better atleast u give it a try never trying means u r already afraid that u will fail
Lol LIS ! ... Colt u bloody Indian , how can u fail in Hindi ? :-RRB- Neva tryin , is a big time loser .
failing ... at least u give it a shot than nothing at all . once u failed , take it as an experience and learn from it .
Failing to Try
Take a risk ... try ... fail ... and learn from our mistakes !
Depends ... If its suicide ... Never trying is better option ; -RRB-
... never trying , how would you know if you 'd fail or not if you will never ever try . . ? ... but I would agree with jackmohan if that is the case ; - P
wrong is failing without trying . TRying is better that losing without figthing : -RRB-
I tried singing and failed ... everyone in the room wished I never tried
I believe once u think u can do it u have achieved 75 %
u cant succeed if u dont fall its part of our lives !
the worst is succeeding in never trying !!! WHAT , why i ca n't understand my own words :-LRB- anyway ...
worst . . never trying ! fail at least u try and u will not have any regrets !
You Cant have a resident in 2 GCC country . you can choose one . . QATAR 2022 will bring alot of oppurtunities . .
Does that mean if you buy a property in Dubai that comes with residency status you can not get a residency permit to allow you to work in Qatar , and vice versa ??
you can have residency of more than one GCC country . It all depends on the type of residency that you have ...
isale is right . even when you pay extra QR , you can carry 2 GCC work permits . Check Hukoomi website
i am interested with this topic . . I know that you can not have to resident Visas in GCC countries . . but it 's too broad ... i would like to ask if the resident visa is a work visa , would it possible to get a new work visa here in Qatar ? Is 6-month autimatic cancellation true ?
it depends ...
i think you can contact the embassy in Kuwait and ask them when they are coming to Qatar so you can see them . last April i went and to meet them in Sheraton hotel to take some letters . or also you can do it with them in Kuwait via DHL . sorry if i do n't know .
Police clearance from Canada needs to be done from Canada through the RCMP and the local police . Far as I know this can not be done through the embassy and will take 6 months or so . Make sure you actually need this , I was exempted .
2 years back I tried RCMP and didnt get the reply yet from Canada , May i ask what could make someone exempted from obtaining it ? , is that related to Company itself , nationality , duration of stay in Doha !!!! Any help plz

Really , the best way to <i> `` maintain parent control over internet use by kids '' </i> is to browse the web with them . This way you can tell them which site to go or not to go to . Plus , you get to spend quality time with them which they -LRB- your kids -RRB- will appreciate later on . I can recommend using <b> OpenDNS </b> if you insist on using an automated way of restricting their web access . Just <i> Google </i> the word <i> Opendns </i> . ...
You can use the properties in Internet Explorer program to control the internet with your kids without other program .

oh really avatar ????? what a sorry a55 u r. ... i pity you ...
The temples I 've gone to women had to be in salwar/saree and men in Mundu -LRB- ie the white lungi -RRB- / pants . Maybe it 's different in the Golden triangle .
yeah avatar - and you were such a sorry wimp i threw u out on your sorry a55
avatar , pls slow down ... take a break ...
avatar ... mind ur words . .
why were u watching us avatar ???? ... . . cheap voyeurism ?????
Please behave people . . what 's this with all personal insults .
DOC - we have KIDS who like cheap thrills ... . first he was after WK ... the faggot and now me ... he swings both ways
This could 've been such an interesting thread for a holiday destination for me : - -LRB-
Why not try the Bermuda Triangle instead ? I hear it 's lovely there . .
avatar is a ` she ' as per her profile ... u stop ur personal insults n i 'll stay out of this . .
Calm down everyone .
I am shocked at such language from ladies . . especially on this day of festival and fasting :O -LRB-
Birt , I was thinking the same , since you posted it , I changed my mind ... well , how about trying the Bermuda itself ? : -RRB-
Does sound like a better option does n't it :O -RRB-
Oh brit , so you know about the fast that INDIAN WOMEN are doing today ??? :-RRB- -RRB-
I have a better idea Brit - shall we send many of the contributors on this thread there instead ?
Lol . . Oh boy what happened here . . Anyway lakes have a nice trip and let me know if you need any info on Delhi & Jaipur ... Never lived in Agra , only visited a couple of times so limited knowledge of that place ...
train journey is safe but take care of our luggage and do n't travel in sleeper class . no one will stop you from wearing shorts but u 'll feel really awkward and maybe people stare at you ...
we did the triangle couple of years back , i recommend you take a package from any tour operator , we took the package from RBS travels . i feel road is better than the rail , and if possible change the order of your visit , delhi > jaipur > agra , coz once you visit taj in agra nothing in jaipur will look good -LRB- jaipur is wonderful though -RRB- taj is best at dusk and dawn ... i can go on and on ... ... ... ...
Wow thanks those are very helpful !
why avatar ... r ur friends on duty there in Delhi ?
I thought shorts were not allowed in temples WK ?
IM I have never seen anyone being denied entry to a temple because of what dress one is wearing . . Shorts are fine as long as they are atleast knee length . . With the temperature dropping in these parts these days , it will take a brave man to wear shorts by the way .
Avatar - rite now i have a better agenda ... .
thats really a nice pic of you avatar , , , , , ,
oh your soooo outdated avatar , . , , , , Mr. tinkerbull most def looks worse than that , , , , he also has 2 horns ... . and a longer tail ... AND he is JET BLACK
you know avatar i actually used to enjoy your silly comments and it used to make me laugh but off late i feel u really need to grow up and stop this childish bickering ... . just a thot
yeah and im coming at you with it ... .
in Barwa towards wakrah there is a Garage for Jeep
Yes , he is good but expensive -LRB- because he 's good -RRB- . He 's a Jordanian weighing about 100 kg or more . But he 's good .
The number I posted is for an Indian . He weighs about 50 kg -LRB- 500 N to be precise -RRB- but he 's also good .
yup before his garage was near shawerma restaurant at teyseer so he is 100 kg or more ;-RRB-
Thank you all , I am sure Ill try one of these recommended . I appreciate your help !
Try 55383551 -LRB- Mumtaz -RRB- near MidMac flyover .
just the two parties involved be present at the counter of the Traffic Office and present filled-up form of transfer -LRB- usually in sales -RRB- and copies of your RP 's , pay the small fee and voila ! Kalas ! Finish !
Agree with flor1212 , per my knowledge . I think it is Qr .100.00 by credit/debit card
No need to show the car . Only both parties to go and submit the form . Pay QR .200 for transfer by e-cash card or debit card .
The form , and the insurance already transferred under the new owner ... no insurance-no transfer .
welcome
This is already a terrible thread .
i knew it when you came already ! number 1 idle Boston !!!!!
I better go , too many girls here .

what a question ... lol
Hi , Dear Better to go al saad sport club at al saab area there is good Swimming pool with trainer ... Best Luck
try to visit AL ZAINA CENTER ... U CAN CALL . .77991669 .
there are many organisations/clubs for such purpose - tidal waves swim squad , dolphins , H2O etc. . . google these and you will get their details . . my child going to tidal waves and they are good .
Hi , you can try Al Gazal Club.my 5kids was there also . . they will start on march 3 for 1st batch.only 300/head .
Thanks everyone for the feedback .
hi , im mother of three its quite normal to have a cross line as yo have put on weight and this line appears if u sit for long hours . . but dont keep any doubts in mind consult ur doctor , it wll give u peace of mind ... live and let live
Do n't worry ! It is quite normal to have lines and marks during pregnancy . Once you 'll have a baby , all will disappear .
I have no idea ... as I said its normal for a line to appear up the tummy , as this comes due to the increase in hormones ... but across I am baffled ... as its not from sitting , & stretch marks ... I am not worried or anything ! :-RRB- just like to know other peoples opinions and experiences , as this is my first ... arrives this Month .
it should go away in no time after birth , for now continue applying creams to lessen the pigmentation . <aÂ href=http://photobucket.com/images/glitter%20iconsÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://i117.photobucket.com/albums/o74/jlb0512/icons/glitter.gifÂ border=0Â alt=glitterÂ Pictures,Â ImagesÂ andÂ Photos/> </a> <i> Life 's a bitch and then you die ! ;-RRB- </i>
bitdefender ...
Avast
Microsoft essentials . it 's free and updates regularly .
AVG - you can download a full Internet Security trial for 30 days and then it defaults to the FREE version which is more than satisfactory ! Have been using AVG for nearly 10 years now and not a problem - very thorough in keeping those hackers and viruses OUT ! Norton in my humble opinion takes up a lot of computer memory and likes to stick it 's nose in everywhere including your internet browsing ! Not to mention expensive ! It came free with my new desktop and I could n't delete it quick enough ! I think it does an all right job with anti-virusing but for me , AVG !!! Good luck
I would say try all of the suggestion above and see which better , you can sometimes keep 2 Antivirus at once , See which one performs better and get that : -RRB-
you can use itt easily !!!! tell me ur handset model which u r going to connect 2 laptop
Should be plug and play .

Normal delivery is QR10,000-12 ,000 , Caeserean is QR12,000-15 ,000 . They charge per night and normally want the baby in for 2 nights . If I remember rightly it was about QR1 ,500 per night .
Well , if AHLI HOSPITAL is being covered by your insurance company then why u r worrying about such things .
12000-18000 according to my colleague who 's planning to deliver there . if ur baby needs to go to ICU , u need to pay for that too .
what ? they 're selling babies now ?
What I heardfrom my friends Relative is Qr-6000 / - for normal and Qr-10000 / - For cezzarene ... Other charges different Bill ...
I 've seen some men 's pajamas in the following places City Center : try in Carrefour , Splash , Asnar Gallery , Debenham . Landmark Mall : Try Carrefour , Marks and Spencer , BHS Villagio Mall : Try Carrefour , Splash . If something else comes to my mind I 'll let you know !! Best of luck !!

A good native speaker English teacher is going to charge a minimum of 200 QR per hour but you might be able to find some one for 150 QR if you are patient ...

a mixed crowd , who you looking to bring :-RRB- ... let me know , i will confirm numbers tommorow , ideally i want a good mix of people so the evening is interesting .
its Orion i believe are you keen ?
4 guys and 6 girls at the moment , any more takers ?
. . entry visas may be finished in one day . . that is , if the person doing it has no other things to do . . but , visa issuance to an applicant has so many requirements . . are you sure it is only the visa you 're waiting for . . ? . . have you received a job offer . . ? . . as i previously stated , mine took only a week -LRB- if i remember it right -RRB- . . and then there was a mistake on the name printed . . and then it took them less than a week to have it corrected ...
I have pretty much given them everything they need . I have already been offered the job and signed the contract . I was told they are sorting out my entry visa which is a 3-8 week process , and when this is sorted they would organise my flights to come to Doha . So I 'm really not sure how it all works from here ...
Individual visa should n't take as long . I think if you have already signed the contract then there is nothing to worry about . Relax , HMC is not going to cheat you . They might have applied for a bunch of visas , hence the delay . Good luck .
Thank you for your responses . It has now been over 3 months and is getting very frustrating ! I am being kicked out of my current job because they can no longer afford to keep me here any longer . 3 months for an entry visa and still counting ! I can only imagine what more things I have to do before they will fly me to Qatar . Is this normal ? Every story I hear , it seems the maximum one has to wait is 4 weeks for an entry visa !
which kind of visa did HMC applied for ? is it visit ? business ? or working visa ?
haha why not , it might be fun ? * - * - * Life is too short to be taken seriously * - * - *
Oh I am very good with research :-RRB- `` Live with passion , Die with style ''
Sounds good !!! I was actually thinking about that idea yesterday and I was wondering how come they did n't come up with it yet ! `` I 'd love to change the world , but I ca n't find a big enough diaper ''
They did long back . There was a chat room on QL , got discontinued . `` Live with passion , Die with style ''
No thax , but this was discussed b4 a zillion times and the result at the END was a big NO !! QL is not any kinda dating or chating site . There are many other sites were u can go and have chit-chats ... <aÂ title=EverythingÂ youÂ needÂ toÂ knowÂ aboutÂ livingÂ inÂ Doha,Â QatarÂ href=http://www.qatarliving.com> <imgÂ src=http://static.qatarliving.com/badges/150x50_iloveqatarliving.gifÂ alt=EverythingÂ youÂ needÂ toÂ knowÂ aboutÂ livingÂ inÂ Doha,Â QatarÂ /> </a>
hahaha TUTOR1 that was a funny post ! `` I 'd love to change the world , but I ca n't find a big enough diaper ''
A big NO would be the answer .
YES is my answer
I think we should leave QL the way it is ... if you wan na chat then find a chatting site , many of them around ...
it 's not necessary
I believe the idea is that if it is discussed in the main forum , someone else with the same question can then search the forum for the answer -LRB- Although they rarely do , hence this question AGAIN ! -RRB- . If it is in a private chat room , all the historical answers will not be available . <aÂ href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3615935822/Â title=TheÂ PearlÂ DevelopmentÂ PanoramaÂ byÂ baldrick2dogs,Â onÂ Flickr> < img src = `` http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3351/3615935822_2ca87f726f_m.jpg '' width = `` 240 '' height = `` 57 '' alt = `` The Pearl Development Panor

Yes you can Visit Qatar in the month of June and you can renew your Passport at your concern Embassy . Regards , SM
1 yes , 1 no . Ask your embassy for the correct answer .
YES , If you have Existing Visa on other Country . NO , If you do n't have Work Visa/Residence Permit to your destination . If your Visa is Visit , your Passport should valid within 6 months .
no you cant as any visit visa requires a 6 months minimum validity on passport . if you 've had a US passport , perhaps they would 've allowed you with a shorter validity -LRB- may be 4 months -RRB- , but otherwise no ...
I dont think even a father -LRB- legal -RRB- can sponsor his daughter alone .
why not marry again n then sponsor
You can . The daughter is always under the father 's sponsorship until she gets married -LRB- even if she is 50 years old -RRB- !
Father can sponsor for sure . Anyways why ask these things in QL ???? you can directly apply the visa and know the outcome for yourself ??? Am I wrong ????
Offcourse Father can sponsor -LRB- resident permit -RRB- for his daughter but he needs to have a family status in Qatar and if the daughter is unmarried and dependent on father then it is easy to sponsor . For visit visas no issues .
i was expecting the positive response . . @salim000 ... what you mean by family satus . .
ofcourse , not bad , nice salary ! if ur in sales , u vil b getting incentives also , any way , u can get a partially furnished accomodation with in QR .5000 / - , n can save minimum QR .5000 / month , if ur not addicted 2 other habits . Best of luck !!!
That is a good offer for Sales job . I know some guys working as Supervisors and Managers -LRB- Sales & Marketing -RRB- who are not getting that much . You can get Executive Bachelor accommodation for Qr .2500 / - and you have to consider other expenses like food , medicine , communication etc. which will not be more than Qr . 1500 / - per month -LRB- depends on you way of living -RRB- . You can easily save good money .
its ennough , but also depends on which country you belong to
which co. . Saar , in sales its , stunning !!!! lucky man
Without Accommodation it is a Bad Deal ... But It 's UPON you Either to go for less money OR End paying ...
the words `` bright '' , `` future '' and `` pakistani '' should n't be used in the same sentence .

Exit permits also shows your name , QID , Nationality etc. and not destination .
Onece you got the exit permit , you are free to go anywhere outside Qatar
As per new way of issuing exit permit it is not mentioned any destination . It used to be mentioned almost 2 yrs ago . Need to exit Qatar thats all .
Exit visa means you have non obligation towards any body in country you are gon na to exit & free to go any where the person 's wants . It is issued in a name with visa number on which person come entrie the country . -LRB- without showing any destination where she or he is going -RRB-
Get a Garmin . Nokia 's screen just is n't big enough to be useful while driving <aÂ href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3262305312/Â title=MonotoneÂ MIAÂ byÂ baldrick2dogs,Â onÂ Flickr> <imgÂ src=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3389/3262305312_f781590578_m.jpgÂ width=240Â height=97Â alt=MonotoneÂ MIAÂ /> </a>
I think you can get it in 990 QR from anywhere ... but check it should have a 4GB SD card included and 1 year warranty !!! If you want from me ... I just got it this month , I will give big discount . :-RRB- Adeel Ali
Get a Nokia 500 , as it is cheap now with free 4GB SD card , it can play mp3 and videos . You can unlock it to install iGO , Garmin , TomTom and many others and it works great with all of them . If you unlock it , your life will be easy and you will also be able to play DivX movies on it !!!
Did you get that , Iryssa ?
Samsung Omnia ... is very good since it comes with a touch screen as all navigation hardware should be ... It also has 5MP camera !!! The best thing about Mobile Phone GPS is you can install Other GPS software other than the company provided GPS Free GPS softwares are Google Maps & Nav4All But Garmin has the best `` looking '' software although all the info provided are the same !!! The free software do not provide Voice Assistance & do the Route Plan . Free GPS software : 1 . Shows where you are in real time . 2 . Shows your destination . So the only thing missing is the Voice Assistance . Route planning is hardly required ... . unless you plan to travel into the desert alone . Buying Garmin GPS software cost $ 200 ... almost a third the price of an entry level GPS Phone . Doesnt make sense to buy it when there are free software !
Jackmohan , I disagree 100 % The screen size on a mobile phone is just too small to be useful as a vehicle GPS where you need 100 % concentration on the road without leaning forward to see which way you are going on a 1.5 inch LCD ! Yeah , probaly fine as a back up for walking once you leave your car , but for driving , buy the right tool for the job ! <aÂ href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3262305312/Â title=MonotoneÂ MIAÂ byÂ baldrick2dogs,Â onÂ Flickr> <imgÂ src=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3389/3262305312_f781590578_m.jpgÂ width=240Â height=97Â alt=MonotoneÂ MIAÂ /> </a>
I had been using all the series of Garmin . its all good with different features with each series . Gamin Nuvi is the model for Automobile Navigation . Nuvi 200 series - 205 , 205E ... . Nuvi 300 Series - 350 , 360 ... . Nuvi 500 Series Nuvi 600 Series - this has a flip antenna unlike other nuvis Nuvi 700 Series expensive of other series with lane direction and 3D building maps -LRB- useful in Europe and US -RRB- . so the Middle East Map version 5 2008 costs 550 riyals with the garmin dealer . Except the Nuvi 205W series all other gaming comes with either Europe or US maps pre loaded as compliment . Nuvi 205W series costs 950 riyals comes with ARABIC middle east maps as preloaded map . I can be contacted if you want English Middle East Maps . again if you choose to buy Nuvi 205W , you dont need to buy the Middle east map additional . All the best .
A GPS is only as good as the map data it has on it or that u can download .
Thank u guys ! Really appreciate ur comments . So Garmin it is ! :o-RRB- Darude , and i thought it is only English on the main forum :P <strong> If you 're looking for a problem , you 're probably gon na find one . </strong>
in ur dreams :-RRB- nooo way
no u can not change without NOC
No .
You are here since 2009 and you do n't know the answer ?
Yes without NOC you can ... but signature of existing sponsor is required ... ...
yes but not now maybe after next 5 years and late before worldcup 2022
darude ... thanks for the wrong info ... city center was on family day ... corniche there was no police , but CID operatives were there ... but i haven ' check villagio and the other malls ... ___ well actually this is not anti-bachelors day ... it may be better called as anti-asian bachelors day ... ____
I just returned from Villagio . They rejected some `` smelly , poorly dressed '' singles . Yes .
magic . . its ok if they did not allowed smelly people inside ... but for the so called `` poorly dressed '' singles , what do u mean ? . . maybe thats the only thing that they can afford . . remember , not everybody here in doha is earning that much to spend on fancy clothes . . the thing is , during these mall family days , mall authorities are `` profiling '' single people . . not all bchelors are restricted ... i know you know what i mean .
its very true discrimination is rife here in Qatar and its a shame because its these very people that keep this country functioning . . I myself have been challenged once on the numerous family days i have entered during to which i replied i am meeting my wife and was let in immediately .
sad , but it 's happening in doha ... just go to the mall in good clothes and pray that the guards will let you in ... good luck ...
huh ? is it true ? because i want to go malling and watch movies ...
no its open for all . i just came from corniche there were no police petrol around and all the bachelors were having good time.but the police might get in the evening
I read in the paper a few months back that their definition of a bachelor was and i quote '' a smelly poorly dressed single man '' i saved the article cause i could believe it actually said that . the best thing i would suggest is buy a small child 's coat and bring it with you when they stop you say you had to run out and get your kid 's , who is in the mall with their mother , coat .
i think its QR300
it is 500 and when the person or company you issued the cheque to will file police complain , it will be on your record and you can not leave Doha and you have to submit yourself to the court with all the evidences from the person or company that you have already settled your due .
It Varies from Bank to bank . . from 100Qr to 500QR ... which bank are you dealing with ??
I thought it was jail time . Is n't it illegal to issue a cheque knowing you do n't have the funds to honour it ?
haha u right tigabaguio . ask google.com <imgÂ src=http://2.s01.flagcounter.com/count/fcPpr/bg=00CC66/txt=000000/border=000000/columns=1/maxflags=1/viewers=3/labels=1/Â height=1Â width=1Â /> <imgÂ src=http://s01.flagcounter.com/count/fcPpr/bg=00CC66/txt=000000/border=000000/columns=1/maxflags=1/viewers=3/labels=1/Â height=1Â width=1Â /> <imgÂ src=http://s01.flagcounter.com/map/fcPpr/size=t/txt=000000/border=CCCCCC/pageviews=0/viewers=3Â height=1Â width=1Â />
of course ! ... . . then renew your Philippine license ...
I doubt it ... Qatari License doesnt carry an International License Status .
You have to get International Driver 's Lisence for you to use your Qatar 's driving lisence in the Philippines . You do n't have to renew your old Philippine driver 's lisence . Call 4344457 for more details .
Of course not !! Qatar driving liscense is for Qatar .
I thought you from other nationality .
in my opinion yes you can drive , even tourists without Philippine drivers license can at least for a week upon arrival . renewal of license now is much faster , just go to any LTO on malls like SM Sn.fernando pampanga , they have kiosk just for renewals , what i know you can get it after an hour or two . goodluck
apply for international licence which is for 100 riyal
no worries mate , read the forum about renewal of license in Phils . you can renew it in 30 mins ! http://tsikot.yehey.com/forums/showthread.php?t=54979 hope this will help you .

Yes , Return Ticket is required to show at immigration section in your country itself
not to enter into qatar . maybe to leave ur home country as jotish said , but once in qatar , it 's not needed , not even to extend the visit visa to up to 6 months , u wo n't need it . do n't forget , in case u want to extend the visit visa , to make the blood and x-ray , than the extension procedure BEFORE , 26th of february . may they have a nice stay .
No return ticket is needed for Residency Visit Visa -LRB- once again you make it sure with ticket booking agency - ie Akabar/riya or what ever -RRB- For your Mother return Ticket is necessary
Dear if it is visit visa return ticket will b necessary for them to come out their country and also to come in to this country . even if u go to buy them ticket they wont give u one way as its visit visa n nt residence visa . . so the better choice if u have a friend working in any agency like etihad or anything try to ask him to provide u two ways ticket then u will pay only one ticket and other ticket will be canceled once ure family reach qatar i mean u will call him n ask him to cancel it once they r here . thats wht my husband did for me . . hope this answer wil help u out . . wish nice trip for ure family .
no . visit visa do not need tickets . neither one way nor return . i always get my visitors visa first , than tell them to book their flight . VISIT VISA DO NOT REQUIRE TICKETS . now to come to qatar by plane , u need tickets , if by land or sea , donno !!!
i meant FAMILY visit visa DO NOT REQUIRE TICKETS . not visit visa .
Thanks for your replies . . my family reached here safely . Only visit visas require the return ticket , family visa does n't require the return ticket . .

They will ship it via `` ARAMEX '' ... hummmmm So strange since to my understanding ARAMEX serves via UK and US -LRB- only -RRB- On the other hand , I will have to agree with the above poster : do you have an import/trading license ?? ... no ?? then `` a lot of things will be seized by the authorities '' Regards !!
just about to write the same as polkadots ... do you trust the seller/dealer ?? Regards !!
I think you can do this , but not order too much . Then it will be as if your doing business . So then you need a license . My friend was ordering sometimes personal stuff for him from China .
Yes you can . . I did this without question at all as long they are not the same item as long they are for personal/gift item as long they are not radio equipment such us transmitter or receiver . if as what you mentioned they are just apparels and it is from China you wont be having a problem with the custom even they are 20 items . and Yes China does use the Aramex courier as well .
thank you all , for the great responses . . ^ ^
hey . 1700 is pretty good-but it depends on what car you 're looking for . im also renting a car at the moment but looking to buy one very soon as it works out much cheaper ! Also , if you get in an accident - the car has insurance , but from what I 've seen - the car rental companies require you to pay 2,500 - even its not your fault . furthermore , the insurance will not cover everything , and you may have to pay an additional amount . please be careful :-RRB-
contact this no. 55975297 they have as low as 1200 ask for Imad .
oh this guy has became greedy then lol
No worry just call the Porsche service centre and check with some mechanics or with the supervisor - they will know who is best in private to do the work of such expensive vechiles
It a 2006 i think but i know it has no warranty . I am not sure but trouble is husband likes it but it is a family decision . I like them but know in Dubai my friends and family all use private guys and are happy but Dubai is a lot bigger and we have many special mechanics - we just do n't know any places yet in Doha . I guess i could try Salwa Rd but where ?
You can go to Gulf Automobiles in Industrial area in St 14 i think or 15 . They fix VW , Audi and Prosche . They are cheaper than the Company and experts also
He is honest and give professional service at very affordable prices . He services my Cayenne 2009 Turbo S , I regret did n't know him before when was driving a cayman , Dealer service is very expensive in Doha . Just a tip , he once told me that Cayenne is a beautiful car but that disadvantage is that when is 3 or 4 years the transmission get damaged , can not be repaired and has to be replaced and is expensive , you may want to consider this before buying it and check the car properly , good luck ! .

Here they will pay you according to your passport not where you obtained your degree from ! So as you are a Pakistani do n't expect too much . I would say around 5k at the best .
Salaries are reserved to the policies of respective companies .
it fully depend on the company , 3 year Exp in Gulf ? then u can expect around 6-7k ...
I think Domasco -LRB- HONDA -RRB-
Based on my personal experience , I would have to say Nissan Service Centre . It is nice to know that their Customer Service Advisors give extra value service .
al khalij . . Porsche , audi , VV . . the best for me and cheap ...
Only based on personal experience , I would have to say Honda . Have had my car serviced with them for the last 10 years and they are the best .

All are OK except TOYOTA . Toyota is so bad that if they wish to worsen it any more then they have no more room to do so .

It 's funny how people cries that they are invaded by us , the eveil westerners when all you hear out there is Malayalam , Hindi and Tagalog .
Qadoomy , I got an english version of the Holy Quran . Want a copy ?
Qadoomi , there is a very simple remedy to this . The rest of the world simply have to not let Western people , movies , culture , technology , science , knowledge and products enter their countries . Nobody is forcing them to accept those things and people . The rest of the world may very well use their own people , movies , culture , technology , science , knowledge and products for their advancement .
Qadoomy , you just said : `` You spoke about indians/pinoys/etc are present here more than Westerners , but I tell you that they dnt have any influence on most ppl , as they dnt target us with their movies , songs , etc. . If you think I speak about westerners invading Qatar , then you are wrong , I mean u invaded the whole arabic world . Please do not take it personal as I dnt hate or target the western citizens as ppl , but ur governments , media , etc. '' They do n't have an influence ? Yes they do , the food , the clothing , the manners , especially when the Qataris are a minority in their own country . This is more of the old rotten speech , they hate the west , they hate what they are but they want what they have .
How can arabic die , when its spoken and learned in 21 countries ? ... LOL ! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1is0KjLJIQ&feature=relmfu
The roman empire was larger than the Arab world and Latin was the official language but where is it now ?
Also , arabic is one of the languages in the UN Council and probably its going to stay as long as the Arab world remains a major crude and petroleum supplier to the world .
We have to admit that Arabs are not using their language as before as we are being invaded by the Western culture -LRB- that comes in forms of TV channels , movies , sports , technology , etc. -RRB- However , Arabic is the language of the most read and most memorized book by heart on Earth , which is the Holy Qura ` n . Now all over the world there are millions of people that memorize this book by heart in it 's original language - Arabic . So the only way to eliminate the usage of Arabic is to get rid of the 1.5 billion muslims around the world ... That thing distinguishes us from the Romans and from the Latin language ... so I can say to the Romans : `` In yo ' face '' :-RRB-
Arabic is not going to die as long as The Holy Quran remains , Islam is the fastest religion in the world . there is Story of Guy who wrote about Western tourist , going down into journy into depth of earth . Long story to cut short , when the decide to go back , they want to leave a message there , as mark of them being here . So they choose -LRB- He the writer -RRB- to write in Arabic . When the author was asked by Press , he said Because Arabic language is going to stay as long as their There is holy quran , and it is langauge of the future.And i say ineeded it , What if All Muslims countries united , We Will be More Powerfull than America . Look to Europe , when they knew why USA is Stronger than economcly and Militray , they decied to make Union to catch with Usa , which is like different Countries united with each other .
Abdira , Did I ever say Arabic was going to die ? I was talking about its use in the UN Council .
Arabic will never die , its only a temporary period where there are a lot of non-Arabs living in GCC and that is the reason for the spread of English -LRB- which is supposed to be the international language -RRB- , in the future when the construction boom will end in the GCC the Arabic language will return to its outstanding position . Qatari government has made a very good steps to avoid the loss of the language so most of the legal transaction has to be in Arabic and many formal departments are dealing in Arabic only . the above is only the social part , and the religious part is greater as for every Muslim the Arabic language is necessary coz it is the language of the holy Qur ` an and learning at least a few words is must for them .
MT : why u tried to learn Arabic although ur English is the international language and everybody wants to learn it !? 1 - u think that it will be an advantage learning other language regardless whatever it is . 2 - u think that Arabic is some special language and worth to learn it . 3 - the circumstances around u made u learn it . 4 - some other reason .
I learned it because I have Arabic friends who I go to visit and their families do n't know much English , so sometimes they speak and I dont understand . It is tiring for my friend to always try and translate to me . Also , I really like the Arabic language and would like to know it just so I know what local people and other Arabic people are saying when they are either communicating to me or about me .
good 4 u MT , this is nice of u , in fact for me working in a construction company with many Indians around me makes me feel that i should learn Hindi and i did not coz i like that language but coz i feel that i have to learn it to make my life easier . So my point is that sometimes u will be in a situation which will force u to learn a language of others and that will benefit them in the end and same is happening for Arabic in Qatar coz u should know Arabic if u want to easily get into formal dept. and that will prevent the death of the language .
True that many people who memorize Qura 'n does not totally get what they memorize however lot of the `` Quran People '' go into Quran studies , learn the Arabic language , and become better Arabic speakers than Arabs themselves . You ca n't say Arabic is the language of Allah , but it is the language of Qura ` n. . . also I just wanted to clarify a thing ... There is no english version of the Qura 'n to become more spread and popular than the Qura 'n we have , since Qura 'n is persevered in Arabic , while having side explanations in what ever language . It 's not like the bible where it was translated to tons of languages , the content of Quran is preserved in Arabic , the explanation or say interpretation can be written in other languages . This is done so we keep the Qura 'n change-free book , and not have tens or even hundreds of `` Holy-books '' that contradict with each-other and each one has a meaning of itself ... we avoided what happened to our fellow christians , thats why every muslim can be proud when saying there is one Holy book which is the Qura 'n : -RRB-
There is a major difference . Arabic is the language of many a nation and will not die out . .
Qadoomy , the Qu ` raan is translated into many languages . English being one of them .
I have the Quran in English !
i guess that what qadoomi is trying to say is `` there is no English version of Qur ` an '' but there is `` English translation '' which shows the meaning of the same , and which can vary from translator to other but the Arabic version is the base for all which ca n't vary or change .
Change is the law of nature .
No , Arabic is going to return Stronger than before , With Qatar Univeristy Offering Law and business major in Arabic , This happend this Spring , before it was all in english , except Arabic and Islamic Shaira
Where is the Arabic qatarliving ?
Arabic Is n't dying . actually if you have n't noticed , most Moroccans and algerians used french as their first language but now after they start re-using arabic again . even here in Qatar arabic institutes are becoming more popular since non-arabic speaker are demanding it .
Only hotels sell alcohol in a bar-like atmosphere . And it 's expensive . Very ! And you CAN NOT drive with even a sip of beer on your breath . My husband and I would always say we got ta get out more and then after struggling through the traffic at night for a social event we 'd say , never again . Mandi
Relax at home after a long day 's work ? Swim , play tennis , walk , watch DVDs . Occasional dinners with friends , a movie at City Center . Church . Vacations to the Middle East and Asia . Write a book . Mandi
You will not be able to do much as mentioned by Mandi who is well aware of the difference .
There 's a kind of suburbia effect here ... A lot of people tend to stay home or do chichi things like play tennis at the club and have hotel brunches . You 'll have to get creative . Not impossible , but it can be a stretch sometimes .
Not sure if you have moved here yet but there is lots to do ... golf club , rugby club , eating out , bars , swimming , water sports , shopping , cinema , bowling , skating . I have 3 kids and have been here since June . Ramadan and the summer have been hard but there are lots of different things to do for entertainmant-you just have to go and try everything . If you ca n't stand the awful driving then get a taxi as not that expensive . Who you working for ?? Good luck .
had stuffing mix and cranberries in abundance last week . I have heard that there is no pumpkin yet -LRB- have bought it there before -RRB- They occasionally have marshmallow cream -LRB- can get that almost anywhere at times -RRB- and jello-almost never see the sugar free kind , but the regular is in abundance everywhere .
Megamart has - dried cranberries in the produce section -LRB- but no fresh -RRB- - canned whole cranberries in the reduced-price section - canned pumpkin . I snagged the last 2 cans in the canned veggie aisle , then found a guy stocking some in the baking aisle - I also found pie crust mix . Do n't see it too often . It will go fast . -LRB- I left a few for you guys -RRB- - no marshmallow cream - no stuffing mix - no SF jello
OMG I will have to rush to Megamart for the pie crust mix . I finally got two cans of pumpkin from a friend -LRB- Expat Sueno -RRB- after dashing all over the city and questioning everyone I know . I saw lots of pumpkin before Canadian Thanksgiving and have been blaming all the Canucks for the canned pumpkin shortage . You better give it up , guys , before I sing `` O Canada . '' Mandi
Anyone nice enough to send me a good cornbread recipe ? :-RRB- Pwetty pwease . The internet is our revenge machine
airport road .
dwmsdavis , Oh please do n't tell me there 's no canned pumpkin , thought I had some but just discovered I am out , so will go hunt for it today . Ca n't have Thanksgiving without pumpkin pie !!!!!! Stuffing mix - have never seen it here . Had to learn to make stuffing from scratch once I moved to Qatar . Cranberries - can usually find fresh ones in the supermarkets . Canned , sometimes . Marshmallow cream - again , sometimes SF gelatin - not sure Most of these things are not found all the time . You may have to look in a few stores to find them all . If I see any of them , I 'll post it here . Good luck !
Probably not , but in all cases if its required , its so easy to get in Dubai airport you just have to pay for the stamps and you will get a valid visit visa for 1 month .
Ask Emirate Airline They know better than US
canada and uae they have very bad diplomatic relationship recently . as per the new uae law all canadians required visa entering uae .

There has been much concern about the health of today 's American trucker . Especially within the ranks of the truckers themselves . Trucker health is at the top of the agenda at the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and they are very concerned about driver 's health . And with the rise in diabetes , high blood pressure and sleep apnea in drivers there is good reason . <aÂ href=http://www.vaninsured.com> http://www.VanInsured.com </a>
I would like to live in Qatar for as long as I possibly can . What kinds of jobs are good for Americans ? If I studied Mechanical Engineering in school , would that guarantee me a good job in Qatar . <aÂ href=http://bestacnetreatmenhere.com/> Somer Nikson </a>

You could go to the Human Rights Committee but that could take months and is not guranteed . Your sponsor has you by the balls I 'm afraid ...
Is there any specific reason why your sponsor refuse to give you permit ? I think if you have good reason they will allow . speak with them once again before you take this issue to labour department .
i can see no reason why your employer will refrain from giving you an exit permit . . however just make sure the following before filing a complaint   ; 1 . make sure that they approved your emergency or vacation leave . 2 . just make sure that your mandoob secures it honestly good luck
give some proof that u will come back , sponser will win in the court , not adviceable , request him once more
Go sleep both of you . . ;p <aÂ href=http://s185.photobucket.com/albums/x25/casabella1434/?action=view&current=286.gifÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x25/casabella1434/286.gifÂ border=0Â alt=Photobucket> </a>
epicurean : you must be new here . I guess I thought it was more than one guy . Anyway , I saw a guy cruising around with a cheetah riding shotgun at the Port of Doha .
saw it too ...
ya i too !!
But Elton John is gay . He needs a substitute .
oh no . . i hav never seen ... cheetah !!!!!! in SUV
in case you find his contacts please post it here so that i can get a pic with the cheetah : -RRB-
let 's see what they think of him when the cheetah mauls him on the face one day ...
And its not just one guy . there are many . You need to get a license from the concerned department and you can keep one . Getting the license is not that easy !!! I know an expat staying in Al Khor who is trying hard to get the license .
The person handing out licences is thwarting decades old trade embargoes in cheetahs , an endangered specises ... Who exactly is regulating this ? not this person who is handing out licences ... if he was ... he 'd know that every person with a cheetah in their vehicle is violating the first law of owning a wild animal ... and that is putting the lives of bystanders in danger ... May he soon be dealt with accordingly ...
Xena ... why a child ? the child is innocent . Why not let the cheetah maul its owner !
hehehe i know the guy . You wan na call the cites office to confiscate his cheetah ?? loool This particular guy can get you , your family , your friends , your friends ' friends deported in 12 hours from Doha if he wants . Plus he has license for his Cheetah and is about to own a white tiger soon . Really cool guy though . I can give you his phone number if you insist ... it is a VERY easy number too heheh ;-RRB-
If you find his details - let me know please . Then I 'll report him to the CITES office so they can confiscate the poor cheetah and get it into a proper sanctuary for wild animals .
Not this again ... DEJAVU http://www.qatarliving.com/node/845976 Wonder if it 's a leopard or a cheetah or the both are out there ...
Yes , again and again , until the moron is captured .
while i was in the bus going to uni in a nice sunny day in Brighton i was reading the famous Metro newspaper and was shocked by this article , http://www.metro.co.uk/news/802402-police-knew-john-paul-masseys-home-was-breeding-den-for-dogs to me i would say wild animals with their teeth out are safer than any dog alive , and god bless all cheetahs and some dogs specially huskies -LRB- i like them i always do -RRB- post some pictures of your dogs and maybe i will edit my comment and add your dogs breeds :p
Right ... And you do n't find removing the teeth of a wild animal just so someone can have it as a show-piece pet inhumane ?
its better than keeping them in cages in the zoo or i am wrong ? we let someone to take care of them dont worry about that just try to feed your dogs and keep them alive . some people buy dogs and dont have money to feed them so . . close conversation .
I 'm afraid I disagree . Keeping wild animals as pets is just as cruel as keeping them in a zoo . At least in a zoo they may be kept by professionals who actually know how to keep them , be fed a proper diet and have the chance to live in social groups . People who parade them round as pets rarely feed them the right diet , do n't allow them to behave naturally and then wonder why the animal turns and attacks them .
I am still stuck on the mental image of seeing a cheetah on a leash walking through the lobby of the W. Sorry , I 'm afraid my baser instincts would gain ascendancy and I would gawp like a rubber-necker at an accident . The small-town kid in me would go , `` Oh , my God , that is SO cool ! '' My bad . Mandi
<imgÂ src=/desktop/cheeta1.jpgÂ width=144Â height=50Â /> Do you guys know what is the code to embed a picture from the desktop ? My little html skills do n't seem to work !
I took down this douche 's license plate ages ago and tried to report it , I was told to bugger off and mind my own business unless I wanted a one way ticket out of here . This guy is untouchable , he does have a license for the animal , and I was told -LRB- but I 'm not sure if it 's true -RRB- that he actually rescued the animal from a `` friend '' in Saudi , who was keeping it in a tiny cage , and that the animal ca n't stand to be kept in a cage and is `` afraid '' to leave it 's owners side . Sounds like horseshit to me , but hey , I was told to shut up .
How long have you lived in Qatar now just out of interest ? Telling us to `` level down if we want to earn a living '' is a joke . Do n't insult me by trying to tell me how to live . I 've been a part of animal welfare in Qatar for years now and the `` he 'll get you deported '' card just does n't work anymore . QAWS reports people for a whole number of violations all the time . Every license plate number , mobile number & photo gets delivered to the necessary authorities , whether it be someone driving around with a doped up Cheetah , a pet shop selling illegal animals or someone whose stolen a dog . If it does n't get any further than that then at least we 've tried to help the animal by bringing it to the attention of the authorities . I 'm sure he has a license . Anyone with the right family name can get one . And I 'm sure he treats it as well as he thinks it should be treated . But I doubt it 's enough . Having a piece of paper does n't mean it 's morally right to own a big cat , rip it 's claws out , take it 's teeth out , drug it to the eyeballs and parade it round in public places like some people do . It does n't give you permission to put the lives of hundreds of people in danger by taking your big cat to a crowded car park and getting it out to pose with . Having a license still does n't mean they are regulated by the authorities or have their facilities checked . There are people here with wild animals with so called `` licenses '' that do n't take care of them . Go to any vet and ask them how many sick and dying cheetah cubs they see every year because they 're not looked after . I 'm sure he is a nice guy . I just think he sees his cheetah more of a status symbol then a dangerous wild animal .
me and my friend is arguing what type of animal was that ... but i think and told her it was a cheetah !!! I find it so cooollll !!!
With whom have you complained about the condition of the animals in the zoo ?
The animals at the zoo fall under the Ministry of Environment and any complaints go straight there . We 've worked with the zoo directly trying to get enrichment programs in place for the animals but they do n't ever follow them . The zoo has a tiny budget and the head vet there is a great guy who has huge ideas on how to improve everything but none of his superiors will authorise the budget to do so . The zoo keepers have no training and are just cleaners who do n't care about the animals at all . We 're trying to get as many people as possible to take photos and submit them with a letter of complaint to the Ministry of Enviroment to try and get them to see how bad it is . The same goes for the pet shops and Souq Waqif as well .
A solely chicken diet wo n't be good for him . Assuming he is a 40kg cheetah , he should be having around 2200 - 2500 kcal 6 days a week with supplemented vitamins and calcium . He should be getting a commercial big cat feed daily with chicken/meat added once or twice a week as well as the supplements .
4 weeks old and potty trained ... . there is something wrong here !
Sorry i misunderstood proxy just like you misunderstood everything i am saying . so if it happens that i know a friend with a cheetah and if it also happens that I am telling people that this guy got some power to own a LICENSED Cheetah , then I am a suck up . wow . . I just hope you do not apply this logic in your daily life . If you are at this stage of life , then maybe it is time to go live in a nicer place UK boy ? unless if you really like it here , which would point out your severely bad lifestyle taste . You are not at the stage yet brother , wake up and stop swimming in your own piss .
Someone please explain ... can a wild animal like cheetah be potty trained before 4 weeks of age . Do n't you find it a bit fishy ? I think the ad is a bit exaggerated !
No wonder the falcon was trained to fly back to the original seller ! @ Next time around he will sell it for 100,000 USD ... ... SUCKER ! ~
Quite so JOA ... you are right ! Cat 's do n't use a toilet ! Dogs do if they are trained to do so !
Whoa ! Has anybody read Quagmire 's profile ? So he 's an Italian male escort whose interests are primarily `` haram and illegal '' ? I do n't mean to draw any inferences here , but ... Mandi
sick as in awesome . . sorry my bad hehe But really , why do you guys like to put your nose into everything and anything ? I mean the guy likes wild pets , he can afford having them and feeding them and allowing them space to run . . what is wrong in this ? I understand if it is causing danger to others or him starving it . . Why do actors in Hollywood are allowed having wild animals ? if everyone minds their own business the world would be amazing
This guy was killed by his tiger : http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/01/10/ont-man-tiger.html This kid was killed by a tiger in a zoo : http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=4051469&page=1 This guy was killed by a tiger he worked with : http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1188880/Zoo-keeper-mauled-death-rare-white-tiger-horrified-tourists.html This girl was killed whilst having her photo taken with a tiger : http://topeka.injuryboard.com/miscellaneous/father-files-suit-after-daughter-killed-by-tiger.aspx?googleid=203316 Do I need to go on ...
quagmire I like cocaine . I can afford having it and will have it in the privacy of my home . Should I be allowed to have it ?
So Mandi ? what is your point lol
common sense gkramer , Liking wild animals is not equivalent to liking cocaine . But if you really do , you should go ahead and do it . . u live once buddy ... Just do it where it is allowed . .
Cheetahs can be owned privately . IF they are respected . But they are not . If someone wanted to own a big cat , gave it a specially designed enclosure which satisfied all of it 's natural behaviours , fed it a natural diet , treated it with respect and had strict safety proceedures in place for all aspects of owning the cat and be PROPERLY regulated with all the correct licenses and documents -LRB- not just buying a license from a friend -RRB- then so be it . We do n't like it but at least it 's well looked after . But having it on a collar and lead in a public place , with little respect for it 's power , keeping it in a barren cage in the garden , not feeding it the right diet , de-clawing , drugging and de-fanging it - it 's not on . We are here to educate people on all aspects of animal welfare including wild and endangered animals . QAWS is a member of the Species Survival Network -LRB- SSN -RRB- which works alongside CITES to regulate endangered animals , which a cheetah is . Leaving a cheetah locked in a LandCruiser in the underground car park of LandMark shopping mall with no A/C and no windows cracked ... That 's just animal cruelty .
In Qatar both are illegal mate .
quagmire is that why you are sucking up to him because he can get you deported if he wants ?
So far the cheetahs and all the other wild animals kept here have not mauled anyone , but that is only because they are drugged into oblivion , thing is they get used to it . . and then ... bloodbath .
he 's got a phantom and one of the only very few Rs6s ... He is not an idiot chelsea , not that i agree to owning a wild animal . But to each of us the things we like in life . His cheetah is SICK and very friendly tho ... scary when you see it but as friendly as a dog .
Many times we 've been threatened with deportation over the years because we 're `` interfering '' . Normally it means the person is doing something illegal/morally wrong and they know they 've been caught .
Ah yes , i heard he was to get a new pet ...
If it 's sick it needs to go to a vet . It 's cruel to have a sick animal and not treat it .
Is the Cheetah called Aiisha ?
Was n't Roy -LRB- of Sigfried and Roy -RRB- mauled by his own white tiger ? He almost died . Mandi
Yep attach your old passport with a valid RP and you can come into Qatar , then you need a letter from your Embassy for changing name and you can change your name of the RP .
Thanks so much for the advice ... I am just confuse a little about the letter , shall i get this in my embassy here in Qatar once I come back ? or I could get this letter from my home country at the same time while Im processing my new passport ? God bless to all of you ! Thanks again ! :-RRB-
Sister , Yes , could get this letter from your home country at the same time while processing your new passport . Cheers ,
And you point is ?
so far and to my knowledge this is not allowed in the immigration scheme actually presenet in Qatar . Maybe the source from which you heard is trying to make some easy money and then leave a `` big trouble '' behind . Only wife and kids can get RP . And by the way nothing has been officially notified by Immigration neither in the newspapers nor in any of the government related websites . Regards !!
One of my friends went to the immigration department for visa extension of his parents . The guys filling out the form asked him whether this is for Permanent residence or temporary . I know there is no official annoucement but you never know in this country .
I think that is the normal or standard questions asked by the agents when they type the forms . Nothing to do with visa for parents . i have never heard RP for parents in GCC .
My uncle stays in Riyadh Saudi Arabia with his family and my grandmother also stays with him on a permanent residence since she was 70 . Now she is 86 and still staying with them . My uncle is the only son and since my grandfather is no more , where would an old woman stay ? I think if you have a proper justification , you can sponsor your parents . .
Is Bicycle playing cards a requirement for permanent residence of Parents ?
One of my uncle is being sponsored by his son in the UAE . Its not something impossible in the GCC . For now , Qatar does n't have a rule giving permanent residency for parents but may follow the rest of GCC at some stage , you never know .
did you have to go through to get you mother on your sponsorship . could you elaborate the process for the benefit of all
dear mir2890 : i shared my knowledge ... you can share your knowledge . unless i had mentioned here . how you would have countered me . i do n't think you have the right to stop others from talking . better be careful . you are most welcome to share your knowledge and information . so hope you will be patient and respond in a better friendly manner . if my information is wrong , by your response i can correct it .
anish79 ... can you please help me with the procedure . Even I do n't mind renewing it every year .
Nice and Healthy Discussion ... Quite informative . Thanks a ton guys .
minhajj , have u tried to apply for this visa ?
Hi , Please let me know if for a single dependent parent residence visa is possible in qatar.Regards .
I have not tried to apply for the RP personally , but a friend of mine has been trying for the last three years now but all in vain .
Why should the government here take the burden of parents sponsorship and medical insurances etc ? Will our parents be able to contribute to the economy in any way ? Qatar is a growing economy and it can not afford needless burdens on its shoulders . I would be happy to be proven wrong ; -RRB-
i have a friend whom he applied for a visit visa for his mother -LRB- 68 yrs old -RRB- . the immigration rejected his application for age reason . we 're not sure of the age limit since the officer did ` nt answer my friend 's question regarding max . age allowed .
not possible ...
minhajj , find a good job back in your place and take care of your parents there itself .
Indeed , they are `` no one '' . Great , BLUEBULL .
Right LP ... ... Guest are NOT allowed to bring all HIS dependent to HOST house . It is allowed in UAE for high salaried individuals , by paying Medical / Health Insurance of AED 5000 / - annually for each parent . YOu are right BB ... it carries Economic sense but human values are missing . I know a family in Qatar having 4 brothers staying in Qatar for last over 2 decades ; each brother sponsored their aged mother separately to keep her in Qatar round a year .
Hello Victory_278692 , Your information looks quite relevant . If it 's true is it possible to share some reference though whom i can learn the procedure of parent RP . Thanks , Regards .
It is not RP it is a visit visa , expiring once every 3 months .
Thanks How many times this visit visa can be extended ?
not in possible in qatar

Soniya , I met Mahmoud at Batilco and he was very informative and they have a good list of CV 's with Photographs of the maids for you to select . We finally selected our house help now just praying she arrives before the baby does . Hope you get your maid too soon .
CONTACT YOUR RELATIVES IN INDIA AND LET THEM SEND ANOTHER RELATIVE TO WORKS AS YOUR HOUSEMAID . . OR CALL THE UK OR CANADA OR GERMANY .
I 'm afraid it is illegal to have a full-time housemaid living with you that you do not sponsor .
Other comments are right ... you may find a part timer but not a full time maid . Check with the recruiting agency to sponsor one is the best option .

Da , they do that already . I 've learned to sleep through meowing . BoPeep , that 's what I 'm thinking , cause my older one 's not much of a player , but the younger is ...

What 's one more ? You need a playmate for your younger cat and the cute kitty needs a home ! It 's a win-win situation !

Gypsy - I think you have all the credentials to become Qatar 's Crazy Cat Lady <imgÂ src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OP0uyN5E6G4/SbGQZnvUEGI/AAAAAAAAAEM/4Rg1NGDexSk/s320/simpsons_CrazyCatLady.gif>
you just replace the lack of men in your life with cats ... . I 've seen it happen and once you take that route there is no way back ...
That 's what my boyfriend says too exiledsaint . :P Actaully the women I know with lots of cats all have husbands or long term boyfriends . I think the spinster with cats thing is a myth/stereotype .
I remember this rough american constuction guy once and he applied to one of those russian dating sites back in the 90s when lots of ladies were looking to get out of russia . However he could not understand why all the pictures the agency sent him where of women surrounded by cats . We checked his application form and under interests he wrote pussy . Now obviously the russians translated this and decided that he must have been a cat lover ...
No , it 's NOT pathetic ! You are a loving and giving woman who wants to open her heart to yet another poor orphan . It 's wonderful . Mandi
gypsy , if you think you manage two cats well ... and adding more would n't be a burden to your sched , then by all means go ahead . . they said that a person who likes cats are often referred to as a sensitive person . . :-RRB- -LSB- img_assist | nid = 12867 | link = none | align = left | width = | height = 0 -RSB- <strong> Nothing in life is to be feared .

Get them a scratching post and carry around a spray bottle of water . When you see them scratching anything but the post , spritz them !
Geez
i do n't want to give it away , panda . . this kitten is really adorable , and friendly and quiet too . . i just do n't want him -LRB- her ? -RRB- to scratch my furniture I will try to get this scratching post , gypsy . . do they have it in the stores in qatar ?

there is a story that i know that would probably freak you out.the lady had a few strays in her house and when she accidentally died , one of the stray ate her left face . why dont you adopt some more cats , and see where it takes you ... hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
3 Cats ... . . Not a big deal at all . I know one Western lady in Qatar who has morethan 30 Cats and One Dog ... '' Hatred is the coward 's revenge for being intimidated '' ... G.B. Shaw
30 !?! That 's not the owner of the Vetrinary clinic is it ?
No gypsy . . last week I visted her house . . It was really amazing to see all that cats .
yes , panda . . am sure . . but as they have said also . . there 's always an exception to every saying/rule . . :D -LSB- img_assist | nid = 12867 | link = none | align = left | width = | height = 0 -RSB- <strong> Nothing in life is to be feared . It is only to be understood . </strong>
Hmmm , my boyfriend is trying to say that one more would be too many ... I 'm really torn . The kitty is half blind and desperately needs a home . :-LRB-
Hmmm , My worry is I get 3 , what 's stopping me from 4 ? or 5 ? I need to stop going to QAWS :P
I think 3 is probably a recognised limit before you start getting strange looks from people . Also , if you get any more than 3 then the cat food expense will really start to affect your budget . Ok I 've given you reasons why not to get any more than 3 , and now it 's up to you to maintain that stance !
You need each other I love cats and would have a house full of them , but I 'm allergic :--LRB- And I aint no crazy old spinster , just an animal lover I have 2 , but they have to live outside So adopt that one on my behalf :--RRB-
Go on Gypsy ! Have mercy on the cat . :D <I> Mind your own business , then you will see the joy coming into your life .
tcom she 's too busy playing with her new cat to bother with QL . : P
show , no matter how many of them you adopt , after you die you are r not going to `` see where it takes you '' anyway . . <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed .

No I have n't had time to go get her . I 'm still debating it . : S
Ok things to consider . -LRB- the list is not exhausted -RRB- 1 . Cost . Cost of food , vacination , and other Vets expenses and kennel costs when going away on holiday . 2 . Time , do you have time to take care of them or are you expecting that they take care of themselves , like cleaning the litter bin , making sure that they have food etc and have some time to spend with them . 3 . Welfare , Are the cats going be locked in all the time ? Are they going to be let out ? ----------------- HE WHO DARES WINS
bag of cat food from Royal Canin ;--RRB- ... <p> `` if you do n't like the heat ... get out of the kitchen ... but stop trying to fan the flames before you leave ... it will burn you on the a ** as you go through the doorway ... '' ME </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong> visit www.qaws.org
Oh sure Xena , get my cat hooked on the good stuff early ! I 've already got one who wo n't eat anything but the Royal Canin baby cat food -LRB- even though she 's 4 years old -RRB- and one who can only eat Fancy Feast wet stuff . Uk , that stuff is n't the issue . My issue primarily is that my second cat is VERY needy . She was abused by her previous owner and for that reason she throws up when stressed , bites and in general is a handful . I do n't mind I love her . But I 'm not sure I have time for one more cat that needy . And with her being half blind and Mimi being fond of jumping ontop of other cats and playing , I do n't want to stress her out cause of the other one leaping at her all the time .
Check to all of those , although I 'd love to have more time with them . :-RRB-
Ok so there 's no physical reason why you can not have the 3rd cat . From what I can tell , you 're indecisiveness does not come from the fact that you think 3 cats are too many , it comes from the fact that you think 3 cats may lead you to more cats , and thus the crazy cat lady syndrome . Rest assured , that when you have 3 cats , you will really only have 3 cats . Extra cats will not magically appear no matter how much you worry you will fall into the temptation to have more cats . If you are worried now that 4 or 5 cats are beyond your limit , then I can safely say that the worry will not disperse in your sleep over night , and you will not be forced to watch your feet as they uncontrollably lead you into the cat shelter and pick out another kitty to add to your already full household . I can promise you , your thought processes will still be intact after 3 cats , and even if you want more , you will be able to weigh the consequences and decide against another one , no matter how cute the face staring at you is .
LOL . One can only hope MissX . :-RRB-
I have faith in you Gypsy !
Got a little bit excited about the cat and got click happy ?
LOL . Nah , slow computer . :P
my concern again is their nails . . my kitty started scratching the couches . . but somehow it does n't leave the marks so far . . but i am afraid once he -LRB- or she ? - we still did n't figure it out -RRB- becomes stronger , all my lovely furniture will get ripped ... solution please ? <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed .

both of you just go for full doctor check up and see what might be the reason . . and problem can be cured/solve also . . other option can be test tube baby also . .

DR.ASHRAF AT AL RAFA POLYCLINIC
Dr.M.A.M sahatha in womens hospital has evening clinic which costs QR 100 per visit ... it will take an average of 5 visits . He is an elderly gentleman but has a miracle touch for all his patients wanting babies . The treatment all together at HMC will cost upto 15000QR though
consult DR. Zinath Rizvi at Al Ahli hospital .
souk !
Go to Dukhan beach resort ... Sealine Beach and play with dune sand there ... Al Shamal Beach ... . al Ruwais Beach ... . Thats only few ...
www.q-biker.com You can rent a Ducati or a Buell ... I do not recomend you go to the track with them ...
at Silverstone cicuit in United Kingdom you can rent a Sport bike for about 300GBP per day ... at Pannonia Ring in Hungary there are bikes for about 500-700 euro per weekend ... and so on ... so that is posible and this is not funny ... Thanks for information ...
listen man , In the US you can now schedule a visit to the Moon if you pay enough money . Can you do it in Doha ? Yes it is VERY funny what you asked . Try telling the rental company you will take their bike to the track and even the receptionist will laugh at your silly ars . u need special insurances & proof of racing experience , and in a place like Doha , good luck having a company go an extra step for these processes ! plus of course enough demand for the rental business to survive after renting for a 0.1 % population of bike racers with no bikes . good luck though , tell them in UK they do it if they object .
this forum is for asking ... I don t know what can I find there ...
ok , just keep in mind that tracks do not open until October in here . I actually work in the field of racing , which is why i am trying to educate you , but sure if you think i am wasting your time . Also , the best you could find here anyways is a stock with a bazzaz ECU and a B.S tune as there is n't even a proper dyno in here . Easy on the ego/attitude buddy , i do n't need to see your results because i ca n't care less :-RRB-
To my best of knowledge '' Yes '' , there are a couple of Bike shops in Souq Waqif They have Indian , Chines and other type of standard types of Bicycles at reasonable -LRB- you can call - cheap -RRB- prices . just ask around for them , several can point you out where they are there .
In and around Electricity street are many small shops tha sell bikes for very little .
I have seen a couple on Najma Street . From C ring road coming from Toyota signal take right turn at Doha cenima , drive past the roundabout and you will see one on the left side of the road at the corner of the street . On the airport road coming from toyota towards bank street after dasman center take left at the traffic signal and you will see one on the right side .
i knw its too late , , , but if its nt i do have one trek bike , , selling it 850 it can be less , , , if u r intreasted in buying plzz call 66994106

Company will transfer all your end of service and final settlement of salary to your bank a/c . and will give a notice to bank you are terminated from job . So the bank will freeze your account and transfer the proceeds to Loan settlement .
if u r not having money to pay pls tell them to take the car and close the account , or give the for sale at qatar living and if sold fopr a good price pls close the loan and give the car to the new person . if u are in doubt pls start doing now itself
But what will happen to the balance loan amount , which will be there after all money recovered by way of final settlement , freezing of a/c Will the bank allow him to leave the country with unpaid loan ???
The sponsor will not cancel the RP until receiving a bank letter stating that there are no outstanding liabilities . So if you owe money on a loan you ca n't leave until its is settled . Best to borrow money from friends/family to pay it off , or you might get arrested for being a loan defaulter . There is nothing you can do to avoid paying back the money .
In Our Company There was Same Situation with One Person . . He Was Terminated from His Job ... Then he ask for NOC because He have no money to pay for loan . And He Got NOC now he is doing job in another company and also he paying his loan also every month .
What about the fees which i payed for insurance while taking the loan . Will not they help something by paying the remaining amount to the bank .
thanks 2 all
for the last 28 years , i just did n't understand what kind of celeberation way is this by creating so much trouble for other commuters & police . They will shout like animals , make loud engine noises , burn their tyres . They do n't realize that may be there might be a patient behind them who needs medical attention or has somekind of pain in his ears by hearing loud voices etc. . Sadly speaking -LSB- no offense -RSB- , they are QATARI youths mostly . I wonder whether they give any alms or donations in the name of ALLAH if they get any happiness or victory in their failed but at the same time very popular game FOOTBALL . . They just proof themselves as one of the most IGNORANT people on earth as they just do n't care for others . _______________________________________________________ ***** / / / You remind me of my next girlfriend / / / *****
Actually there celebration reminds me of biker gangs in US . And when you see them you do the exact same two things no matter where you are . 1 -RRB- Ignore them , 2 -RRB- Back in your mind you say ... Idiots
I like it when Qatar win the football , it makes me feel part of a proud country . That said , I do n't live in Doha and it 's a bit different to have a few people roaring round Dukhan waving flags and hooting . If I was on the Corniche at that time it would have probably been different . I have had to wait before on the fast road to Shahhania as 2 cars have blocked the road to have a chat !
It is their way of celebrating the weekend or some even like football etc. and I absolutley do n't find anything wrong with it . Usually there is a huge trail of vehicles honking and blinking musically And the timing they choose is always after 11.30 pm . So , it is certainly not a office timing . And if they encounter an ambulance they give it a way , I have observed it personally . Even once our own car was clinched among them somewhere near Mall R/A and they stayed behind us and gave us a way . There are different ways people celebrate their weekends , some drink , dine and date . What is wrong if some people chose driving as their way to enjoy ? Everything gon na be alright !!!
yah they are Qatari so what is your problem they are celibrating they dont disturb other country so pls . live them alone they are in their own country .
I was at corniche too . My friends waved and shouted ` Mabrook ' and they waved back . Nothing in comparison to a wedding procession in India though , bands and groom on the horse and ...
wedding procession in India is something with reason and has a specific route -LRB- short distance generally -RRB- , but what is the reason for these ??? just read someone supporting this type of ` vulgar display of wealth ' ... wow ! what supporters !
Comm ` on they are passionate about football . They are young with raging hormones and want to express their feelings for something they feel for . Hah !!! I would be with drums cheering for my college cricket team with a hoarse throat in my youthful days . -LRB- not that I am old ... -RRB-
Guys am lookin 4 a contact in qatar foundation 2help get ajob who knows anyone plz
Mom_me ... no you are n't old at all , still you have the spirit ... lol ! My opinion was to critic something which obstructs civic life . Venting out enthusiasm by slowing down traffic is not at all civilsed , what do you say ?
But Siddh , they normally do it only once a week and that too on late Friday nights is what I have observed . Is there any harm in it ? The traffic moves more slowly for say 10-15 mins but come on , it is not office time . Rather than a ` vulgar display of wealth ' I feel it is their way of relaxing on a weekend . As long as they do n't harm anybody I feel its o.k. . They are just having a nice time . Well , I wish to join the convoy sometime just for fun ... :-RRB- Everything gon na be alright !!!
Shreeya - think this way : - Relaxing on public property ? Is it normal ? - Disrupting traffic by stopping cars on the road , speeding etc. for relaxing . Is it sane ? - You compared drink , dine & date with road rage ... the difference is clear between privately celebrating or showing off publicly ? Watch this video ... another kind of ` relaxing ' http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJupNDIKkEk Maybe future of Qatar ? lol !
Rumor . You need a NOC to change sponsor and this is purely upto the sponsor , whether he wants to issue one or not .
In your list , Armada would be the favorite although Prado is not too bad either . But if you want the bestest SUV of all among the Japanese models , then my view is that it is the Nissan Patrol . On the other hand if you want to buy a good SUV but still want to be green and go easy on the environment : then buy either a Prado with 2.7 litre engine or a Toyota Fortuner with the same 2.7 litre engine . The 2.7 engine in the Fortuner is cool on fuel and the car is a reasonably sturdy 4x4 and 7 seater .
Armada ? Is n't that in a different class to the other 2 ? Armada has a 5.6 V8 engine and is more suitable for a family car that only goes to the sand -LRB- beach , dunes , etc. -RRB- rarely or lightly . The Prado and Pajero both offer V6 engines with good -LRB- if not very good -RRB- off-road capabilities . The i4 Prado is not considered good due to lack of power . Both these V6 cars are quite reliable too -LRB- I do n't know enough about the Armada , though -RRB- and can carry up to 7 people with the driver . Maintenance wise , Toyota and Nissan can be difficult due to the long queue at their service stations . Otherwise , you can try your luck with non-dealership service workshops . I 'm sure there are a lot of good ones out there that can work on these three models . You can head to driverarabia dot com for more info on most cars .
Re Choice of SUV Prado > Pajero > Armada ! Toyota Prado 2012 - the TXL scores over VX ` cos you can always get aftermarket GPS whachamacallit to spruce up your Prado TXL . Upper spec trims may be a waste of $ $ $ . Mitsubishi Pajero 2012 - the 3.8 271 HP ranks higher over other Pajero variants and when compared against Prado & Armada , the Pajero may appear ` dated ' Nissan Armada 2012 - v8 beast , gas guzzler !

I Suggest You Al-Ahli Hospital Dr , Sujatha
Khudsia Begum , Hema Rajeev -LRB- AlRaffa -RRB- etc
What elegance has suggested , it 's absolutely right . . Dr.Khudsia is highly recommended one in DOHA . . However , you can even pay visit to APOLLO if u r looking for INDIAN gynaec ... Kindly go through the below link . . http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1173008
Khudsia begum and Hema rajeev and khudsia begum is also from India -LRB- Bangalore -RRB-
Dr. Khudsia has a private clinic on Al Waab street . She is a very good doctor . . although there is a long waiting line outside her clinic even before it opens , so make sure you go early otherwise you 'll have to wait for a looooong time . she does not take phone appointments , so the only option is to go to the clinic and take a number ... Another excellent indian doctor is Dr. Sujatha in Al-Ahli hospital . . She is south indian , maybe keralite or tamilian -LRB- i 'm not sure -RRB- . . you can make telephonic appointments at the hospital to see her . . she also gives her patients her mobile number in case of any questions or emergency and attends all her calls . . she is really good . . !
Dr.zeenat rizvi is an excellent doctor , who is most experienced than all in qatar and also world renowned doctor -LRB- worked in uk -RRB- . she diagnose each cases uniquely.but getting her appointment is difficult as she is too busy . also Dr.Hema rajeev -LRB- al rafaa clinic -RRB- is good doctor , she will deal straight forwardly & good decisions given by her .
Dr.Zenat rizvi working with AL AHLI HOSPITAL
<!--break--> yes Dr zeenat rizvi is the best in ahli hospital ... . i used to consult her n even Dr sujata is good ... ... infact all the doctors in ahli r good ... ... . . dr kudsia is from mangalore ... . . she is very nice n friendly ... the only disadvantage she doesnt take prior appointments so all u have to do is wait ther ... ... i don suggest apollo clinic ... i really had a bad experience ther ... . . nd yes hema rajeev is good in al rafa clinic ... . . but the thing is whn u complete ur 6 months she gives a referral either to ahli or hamad ... ... so its better to go to ahli hospital itself ... . .
Good one ! So you want the passcode ? I bet you wont be seen again after you have it !
haha no man . . if i wanted to keep it then i would have hacked it by now . . the internet has the details to do so . . why would i even bother posting a question if i wanted it for personal use ??!!

Another thread to spread hate taliking , no need to comment
I have a request to the mods to delete such threads and I will flag it as offensive . I do have another request to all QLers not to post offensive subjects in this forum . I know that a real Muslim will not post anything offensive to another community and I am expecting the same from all the other communities in QL and if things are going in this way then I will say good bye to QL even if is of not something important for you all . Please abide the guidelines of the forum . If anyone is interested for a debate on something related to a community they should approach the community leaders for a debate .
It is the game that matters ... not the Jersey or the player . . So better be away with your F *** ing thoughts . . Try to be a human than a worshiper ...
You forgot Liverpool ... Carlsberg
If yes then please go post your question on some religious forum -LRB- I can recommend you some if you like ... by PM -RRB- or better still go ask a scholar . Posting such queries on a public forum of mixed beliefs is a sure fire way to cause religious bashings & mockery both to you & Islam.Oh & if you are not a Muslim ... well non of your beeswax then . . lol
his highness sheikh abdulla after he bought a club said he will not renew sponsorship with a gamblers company , and remove it from the team . but for the players they have no choice , this is the team they play for and they only wear it during games .
I asked the question as I picked it up in an article from Malaysia . Here 's the link : http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/7/19/nation/6689974&sec=nation Wanted to know what Muslims in Gulf thought of it . BTW , gkramer , baldrick2dogs , you label me an idiot , and yet you argue with me . So what does that make you ? Do n't hate the messenger , hate the message .
I did n't argue with you , I just labelled you an idiot ;-RRB- I am not arguing even now , I am still calling you an idiot : D
now wait , do i need to order my bebsi and bobcorn ??
i dont understand why anything and everything is being related to religion . what does a sport have to do with the religion of a player . i dont think the football will not come to the player coz he is a Muslim ... as far as clothing and signs are concerned , they have their own meaning . they just dont put a cross on the tee for namesake . u got to dig deep to know the meaning of that symbol on their tee .
I wo n't take offence , since an * ss is calling me an idiot . I guess that 's what you do , when you ca n't contribute anything intellectual . ; -RRB-
Dont play football
Muslims have better jerseys to wear instead of this crap ones ... i know the future of this thread ... were its going to GO ! : -LRB-
By this standard Muslims in Switzerland and other countries with crosses on their flags should n't salute the flag or wear it on their uniforms . And what if a Muslim plays for England or Scotland -- two more flags with crosses ?
I think you are an idiot . Well , you did ask ! As to Man Utd . To the best of my knowledge they have no Muslim players , so it 's not really an issue is it ? They were traditionally a Catholic team many years back . It was difficult for a protestant to break into the team let alone a non-christian !
Let the muslim player playing the sport decide that for himself , he 's got a mind of his own and you nor me are in a position to dictate what he should or should not wear . So stfu and go to your corner . Like the wiseman Rizks said , this thread will take an ugly turn !
Baldrick you beat me to the idiot comment but ya he is asking for it .
Without bothering the find the details . Did I issue the instruction ? No , I just asked the question to find out the opinion of Muslims in the Gulf . Did I insult the religion ? Not at all . But yet you choose to come to the defence of the religion -LRB- I hope -RRB- by labelling me an idiot . How am I an idiot ? By seeking to clarify confusion and misunderstanding ? From the views expressed above , it is obivious that not all Muslims share the opinion . So obiviously this is a misinterpretation of the religion . And that helps separate religion from the politics and propaganda that cloud it . Perhaps you should jump into the gulf . Seeing as you 're already jumping to conclusions .
I am very happy with the world around me , I ai n't jumping into any gulf ; -RRB-
Firstly , I think you 're the one to blame for everyone calling you an Idiot . Reason being is that you did n't put the source of the article , thereby making everyone think that you 're asking the questions and are out for some religious bashing .
No problemo amigo , remember to quote the source ... ALWAYS !!! ; - -RRB-
Should christains stay inside when there is a crescent moon ? Its a question we should all ask ourselves ... and they should not play for Portsmouth either as its on their football jersey !
thread , beter ignore
That is very much possible . Your private doc may refer you there . Just make sure to register in Hamad for giving birth , I think that is to be done by 35 weeks but not sure .
Yes you can.i had my prenatal at the private doctor and gave birth at Womens Hospital . The private dr. will give you referral letter for the hospital you want to deliver your baby .
Against the law to work while on a visit visa . If your brother wants to find a job here then he would have to transfer his visa to a working visa or risk getting into trouble .
its problem
well its illegal for anyone to work under a visit visa , but there are many people who still dont mind / care . some employers do employ people on short term basis though it is illegal . if caught both can be fined and ur husband would most probably deported .
Thanx , it 'll be a great help
you will go to police and go out of country
if you are working in a hidden place nothing will happen espacially if you stay away of problems . but if you were caught due a problem you did espacailly in resturents or front offices , the interior ppl will throw you out of the country with a band
1 . If you need medical assistance it will turn out that you are an outlaw here . Postponing to solve the health issues can turn fatal . 2 . Once you leave the country you can not come back . . so you are forced to stay here as long as possible if you think the job is worth . .
lol good one

Call Remittance department at HSBC head office , Qatar . you can find the contact number on their website . I belive they can do the transaction through BANCO DO BRAZIL or through their own office in brasil .
Either go to Western Union or use online banking . Brazil is no different to any other country in this respect .
If that fails , give it to me , I will make sure it gets there ... ... ...
which bank in Brasil you want to send the money ?
I would think 9-10K is reasonable as a basic salary for 4 years of experience . However , I do think you need to be paid additional allowances for accommodation , transport etc. . Also make sure your annual flights and medical insurance are covered . All the best .
Family visa is not a problem . Once you come in and complete your residency formalities , you can process your wife 's visa .
Firstly I take it this is 8000 per month ? If so then NO do n't accept unless the contractor provides you with housing at the VERY LEAST . Rent in Doha is very expensive . The average rent for a 2 bedroom apartment in doha with furniture is at least 6000 QR a month . As for family Visa 's I do n't know enough to give you accurate information . But if you have Children who are at school then you would also want the contractor to pay tutition fees as school fees are expensive as well .
If you get the Accomodation Allowance or Comnpany Provided accomodation and the medical coverage , then even 8000 Qatari Riyal is also ok but 10000 Qatari Riyal will be fair enough for a person with 04 years experience only.It also depends on your family size like for a small family with a kid or no kid even you can survive in One bedroom + 01 Sitting room also which may be aorund 4000 Qatari Riyals fully furnished but for a bigger family it will be very difficult for you to stay on your own as you will need to get a bigger house . Arranging the family visa is not a big problem as long as you have salary more than 7000 Qatari Riyals.Best of Luck
Thanks all of you , the package includes accommodation by the Contractor and pick and drop facility from your house to the site . The timings are from 0600-1800 and six days a week . What are the charges for processing my wife 's visa ?
I can give you By road 8QAR/kg Documentation250QAR with in 10Days this will be reach there if you need you can call me on 55990644
we also came from muscat ... * GAC * is the best cargo service
Thanks Moon65 . Can you please elaborate on the cargo service name ? Their contact number or website address ?
I got it -LRB- GAC -RRB- . No problem .
Hi MoveQatar2012 ... I am also relocating to qatar by the end of this month ... Can we discuss this matter over phone ? if possible/economical , can we consolidate the cargo ? or atleast we can share our ideas ... my number is 9533 4839
MoveQatar2012 , please stick with domestic shipping companies as you can get reviews online , most have brick offices where you can follow up or complain , you can also check if they are verified merchant - this are for businesses online . I used Shipnex -LRB- http://www.shipnex.com/ -RRB- services when I moved to Kuwait , & just like ` kasthurirangn ' , I shared expenses with my office mate who was also deployed to Kuwait .
hi merilet , what is the name of your local agency ? for my case i 've been waiting more than 2 months before the visa has been released
My sponsor company applied on 9th April and i got the working visa on 18th April itself.I think it depends on the sponsor company and hr follow up with embassy .
within one day dear or next day visa issued if you have visa approval if not than need to apply for visa approval which will not take more than a week or ten days thanks
I am waiting for around 3 months for the same . Do n't know when they release work visa and what the actual duration . I think there is no actual duration for work visa issuance .
If the company has available visa for your nationality , teh2008 is right you can get it in a day or two . But there are factors why your visa has not been released yet , e.g. the PRO is lazy , the PRO is on vacation , no visa approval yet , the position is on hold , other internal factors from your employer or agent etc. . Better confirm again with your agent in the Phils . to remind the employer : -RRB-
zairulamri@: yes i am waiting for around 3 months . how many days after did you get your visa after applying ? pls share ...
work visa can be rejected as well . If everything is all right , it takes around 3 days . If there are some problems , it might never be issued .
do i need to wait longer or i need to find another employer ? please give me advise . best regards , JM
Double check with your agent again if the employer is really serious in employing you and request the reason why your visa has not been processed yet . If you can no longer wait then you might as well look for other opportunities . You have been waiting a long time already ... Anyway , patience is a virtue : -RRB-
thanks for the advise , in my case i would say that the processing takes to long 0 . 9-18-2011 - initial interview over the phone by IT head -LRB- 1 hour -RRB- 1 . 10-12-2011 - Employer Interview -LRB- Manila Philippines -RRB- Personal Interview 2 . 10-19-2011 - Follow up interview over the phone -LRB- verify skill in HP-UX system -RRB- 3 . 12-27-2011 - Draft contract release 4 . 12-27-2011 - Signed draft contract and send back to employer 5 . 1-5-2012 - Medical exam completed 6 . 1-10-2012 - Medical result release -LRB- FTW -RRB- fet to work 7 . 2-2-2012 - Submitted to Local agency the Complete requirement duly authenticated w / stamping done by the qatar embassy 8 . 2-24-2012 - follow to agency - update only they already send to employer and already received by employer 9 . 3-8-2012 - 2nd follow up , still no update with the employer . processing almost 5 Months already
it 's really dependent on the urgency of the position . i was stayed in PHIL for more than 2 years waiting to finish the 2 yr ban . i had plenty of offers actually in KSA but i turned them down . last october 2011 , an employer in qatar called me , we discussed the offer and then i 'm there by mid DEC. it was actually me who delayed it , could have been deployed by NOV. . how ironic , i turned down plenty of offers in KSA but look where i am now . Multiple business entry here but my RP is Qatar . for your case , 5 mos maybe too long enough . try to get their -LRB- employer -RRB- position on the situation and if it 's doubtful , plenty of opportunity awaits elsewhere . goodluck ; -RRB-
i was thinking already to look for another employeer .
as promised , im updating my experience in how long im getting my visa . I just receive my working visa yesterday , Alhamdulillah . And Insyallah , i will be reporting to my company early month of April . Currently im waiting for my flight ticket . bdalien , total days after im applying for my visa is around 3 weeks .
in your case zairulamri , you got your working visa after 3 weeks , in my case its almost 7 weeks already , but we are on the same company , i do n't know with my local agency why it is delay
after waiting for almost 6 months , yesterday just received my working visa , hopefully i 'll be there by end of april

Been trying to reach Virgin Megastores in Villagio by phone , but no one is answering .

I guess you are asking about the Visa on arrival as you are Australian . Its better to check with Airport immigration regarding the age for VIsa on Arrival . Family Visit Visa is difficult for 65 + . Tinker its not imposssible but very difficult , my MIL is 77 . She came few months back .
i have no idea the process as hubby took care of it ... anyways now she cant come as she is sick ...
I tried for monther last year she was 71 . . all my effort was vain ... ... anyway try your luck
I do n't want her to stay , she just wants to visit as a tourist to spend Christmas with us . Is it so difficult ?
If your mom is a widow , then get an authenticated copy of the death certificate of your dad + the other docs required by the Immigration . If not , both parents should travel as required . or Go to the Immigration and make clarifications .
You can make a family visa visit . search the forum for similiar topics you will find help .
Its difficult to get visa for parents aged above 60 .
not just difficult - its next to IMPOSSIBLE to get a visa for parents above 60 ... .

Bro , My piece of advice , advance rental payment of 1 year is not practical and very risky . I highly suggest that you look somewhere else . There are a lot of flats and villas right now being offered by the owner itself and not those filthy , good for nothing , boot-licking , single cell , blood-sucking and parasitic real estate agents . Ahhh , that is much better . Cheers ,
what you going to do if you are being redundant a month after you pay him ?
Normally they asked Post dated cheques but 1 year rent in advance , TOO RISKY SO NO WAY ...
I encountered these same individuals . When we requested copies of the contract between themselves and the owners , they mysteriously disappeared . Everyone I questioned said this is a SCAM , which is becoming more common . A new 3 bedroom apartment for QR 4500 ... it was obviously too good to be true .
Please dont risk that . My husband & i entered a similar deal , the landlord walked in on us saying he had cancelled his contarct with the agent and was asking us to retrieve our money and deal directly with him . We had trusted that the agent was working on teh landlors asignement & had even comfirmed this with contracts signed by the two . We are still struggling to get our money back from the agent & in the mean time the lanlord wants his pay so badly . Dont even think abt it . Pay monthly or simply give post dated cheques ... Fore warned !
Thanks QL friends

As a brand I will prefer Nikon , Sony is cheaper compared to other brands . If photography is not your profession , go for a beginner level camera . As you get used with SLR camera , will be able to compare the defferent cameras and its features that are available in the market.On a later stage you can upgrade to a good one . Sony alfa 230 is a cheap and best option .
I WOULD SUGGEST CANON , ITS A USER FRIENDLY OTHEN THAN NIKON . THERE IS ALSO SOME FEATURES IN CANON THAT YOU CAN NOT FIND IN NIKON .
Im a newbie photographer also , start as our hobby . . I prefer nikon ... Nikon D90 is cheaper than Nikon D300

Not again ... I 'm sure you fall into trap ... If I not mistaken you have your Visa from someone and then when you ask for release he will ask a sum of money from you . . I heard a lot of cases like this . BUT i feel sorry for you because you are one of the victim of Bad business/money making activity by some locals ... It is definitely illegal therefore you have no any rights .
To visit ministry of labor and complain about your sponsor/company and about your case ... ! Hope they will help you . . The second option is that hire a lawyer or complain about this to police ...
If you obtained your visa illegally then you have no rights . If you want to retain your rights , do not buy a work visa .
No i do n't have but they ask me to shoulder the rent a car , change of sponsorship and renewal of iqama etc. .
I did n't buy my visa with them , i work as executive manager but suddenly comes a problem and they terminated me as sales executive and ask me to pay the said amount for car , transfer of sponsorship and iqama .
i refuse to pay but they had already threatened me that they will bring all my documents to CID once i will not pay on that day . I also got statement of account on all things i paid to them but there is no signatory on it but there is a logo stamp on the paper . One thing more is he is a powerful person here in qatar so i get scared when he told me to bring one way ticket to hell .
If i am going to seek help from the ministry of labor , am i sure that i will be safe ? I 've seen a lot of people who complained but they were in big trouble , they are even sent to jail for just claiming for their rights .

If you are on employment visa then you can sponsor visa for your children .
If your company has no objection and ur profession is acceptable with minimum salary required -LRB- i wouldnt know how much that is -RRB- and U got 3 months bank statement and an embassy attested birth certificate of ur girl , yes , it is possible . Check with ur Employer first , get ur PRO to do sum check on salary limit and all should be fine .

call on 4344444 its their travel division . you can ask the operator to connect to the department that you want to speak . in case you are looking for a job with them , its not a great place to work . the whole group as such as I have frineds who have had bitter experiences with them . not one but many of them . they recruit staff all thru the year with low pay scale and get them work almost like slaves . if they take 100 staff by the end of the year 80 % is terminated for the stupidest of excuses . no job security . go ahead try with them and keep this as a friendly advise . they have a horrible management . located opposite to the BMW showroom near to Blue Saloon . good luck .
Thanks for the head 's up , Pachy Pachy . You are right , I saw in MonsterGulf that they are hiring and I am eyeing for a specific position but instead of e-mailing my CV , I am thinking of going there and forward the CV personally . For the purpose of checking the place and the company environment and all that . Anyway , will check it later then ...
Hi , there . were you able to visit their office and submit your CV ? How was it ? Im in Philippines now and an employer from Regency Group Holdings is coming to conduct an interview ... I 'm confuse if i will attend with the interview or not because of the comments I read about this company .
petrol , sand and asian workers are cheap . Do not buy electrical items here , the after sales service is hopeless , the quality of goods is not the best because there is no consumer protection laws so the companies know they can get away with selling things here that would not be accepted in the west ...

there 's a big chance kabayan but you also need to consider that all medical practitioners here are required to have a license from NHA before you can work . i dont really know how long would it take to get that license though . . goodluck on your endeavor .
Definitely very good chance , getting NHA will not be a problem , why waste time hurry up
Good luck my dear ... you have enough experience and i think you can find job here in qatar .
there is no `` legal '' gas connection like in India those who have a gas stove , are `` eligible '' to buy a gas cylinder and start cooking
Just go to nearest Petrol pump and u will find a shop named sidra or at any supermarket nearby and ask for Woqod gas cylinder . for the first time you will need to pay 360 for the cylinder and around 40 for the Cylinder Knob . Gas stove , you may get it in all supermarkets . so after the cylinder gets over , just pay 15 QR for refilling the cylinder No need of any documents or any paper works , just cash will do .
Thank you all for ur kind support

Thank you so much !! Those are answers i needed to convince my husband . . But what about 1pm and after 6 pm ? is it still pretty good ?
Wakra to D-Ring Road is not Far ! Go ahead and shift to wakra . You can drive at 120KMPH while coming back as the Wakra roads have Speed limit of the same and they have cameras . But hey ! when you reach close to Matar/Airport the speed limit is 80KMPH , but no cameras . ;-RRB- So , you can Drive Fast like me :D * CAUTION : Drive fast only if you are confident in your driving skills . KINGOFHEARTS will not be responsible for any mis-haps that may occur to anyone while driving . Drive Fast but Safe .
it 's depends trafic , with out trafic with in 20 mins u can reach pearl R/A to Mumthaza signal .
Traffic heading that direction at 5:30 is pretty light as everyone else is heading from Doha to Messaid !
Combare to DOha 's inside roads , this is not faar and your kids have good atmospheres too . Go ahead !!!
I lived nearly 8 yrs in Wakhra , good place for kids . Traffic is not that congested specially before 6 . Airport to Wakhra is high speed road and take no time to reach .
Get a tourist visa from hotel instead . It would cost you more but at least it is a legal way of doing things .

aiwa ! is there any company u know that issues business or visit visa ? will it be easier to go directly at the immigration ? what are the procedures ?
My company has a list of pre-approved Visa , but only for `` VALID '' individuals who visit our company for official purpose . And I 'm keeping a good relationship with our Mandoob :--RRB- I know I would need him for a very important matter in the future . Business Visas issued can be renewed up to a maximum of 30 days , making the total to be 60 days , max , per person . ************************** Everything happens for a reason .
it will take 7 working days . send your documents thro DHL .
thank u for all ur comments ... yes , God is good all the time . God bless everyone .
just want to ask your opinion . . my husband submitted his docs -LRB- passport + visa -RRB- to dhl last thursday for qatar embassy . Do you think he 'll get it by tomorrow or wednesday ? Considering that there 's weekend and monday holiday in Phils . . i am kinda worried because his flight will be on thursday morning . I do n't know if it is still ok to rebook his flight on Wednesday -LRB- remember thursday flight nia -RRB- , incase the passport wo n't come out yet . Some airlines do n't like to rebook if less than 24 hrs before departure . thanks .
It usually takes 3-5 working days . They do not process visas but only certify that the paper you received from your sponsor here in Qatar is legitimate . Basically the embassy will only translate the entry visa that you will have to show to the visa personnel in NAIA prior to check in . Once you arrive at the airport here in Qatar , you have to show it to the immigration personnel on duty .
From the time u visit DHL just count 7 working days

Authentication of entry visa
English Modern School , This is a School that teaches the English and Wales Curriculum , however majority of the kids attending the schoold are of arabic background . There are children from a number of different nationailties attending . Teachers are also from different nationalities South African , Australian and a few British and Lebanese and other arabic . Generally the is fine . ----------------- HE WHO DARES WINS
Not a bad school majority Arab but staff are mainly South African seem OK . Kids seem happy
Funnily enough , I would say that native English speakers -LRB- I am one myself -RRB- are about the laziest people in the world when it comes to the English language . If you dont believe me , ask any English person a question relating to grammar and watch them sweat . .
any one here knows if the school is mixed boys and girls ? or do they separate classes in secondary/high school ... ??
I am considering register my children in English modern school . I came from Portugal and they dont talk english ! Can anyone give me some information about EMS ?
Is it possible to trsnsfer him to our company even though he has not completed 12 months in Qatar yet ?? And what is the best way to proceed ? Thanks again in advance

LOL again Gender problum with paln tree

the immigration placed a wrong nationality in the visa , how long will it take to correct it ?
depends on nationality . It the real nationality is one of the restricted ones , the visa will be cancelled . Otherwise it takes 5 minuts .

this happened , its just a typo error by data entry staff in immigration . you just go back with the passport copy , they will correct it . And you must have to correct it , otherwise your wife will have problem to travel . it happened with many people , just go back and correct with immigration .
Its not a problem dear . The same happaned to my sister in-low and she already make entry with out any problem but she was USA citizen .
No need to correct it . It will work , I took it there and they said it not a issue.and told me that no need to Chang ,
Such mistakes are quite common . We applied for Business Visa to Director of a company and visa was issued mentioning his profession as UNEMPLOYED . In another case employement visa was refused coz person qualification was CA -LRB- chartered Accountant -RRB- but concerned official told us that minimum qualification should be BA -LRB- bacholer of Arts -RRB- .
as long as the passport number and the name match with the document u have nothing to worry about ...
thanks a lot guys ... but guys u all are getting me confused ... bcoz its abt my wife 's travel , she is travelling with my 10 months son and i dont want any more problem for her ... i think i shud wait for eid holidays to end and then go to the emigration and check it once , i think its always better to correct it than taking a risk ... what do u all say ... btw when are the EID hoildays ending ... Happy Eid to all you guys ...

I am a working mom too . I have a live in maid to look after the kids.First of all you have to be very very good with the maid if you want her to be good to you . Treat her like one of your family members , she will never betray you.If you are planning to hire a maid , look in to these guidelines
Mjamille28 , Sorry for asking this question , what is the visa of your mom ? because this time my sister is about to leave the country on april she already stayed here for almost 7months , her visa as family under my sponsorship is more or less to be finish and i wait again for another 3 months to take back her again . any recommendation for a place or nanny who wants to take care of my daugther she is now 17 months old . Very Thanks ...
I work and my husband stays at home and looks after the kids -LRB- aged 3 and 4 -RRB-
Hi ! I used to work in a hospital and luckily they have a day care center . But i guess my kids -LRB- 11 months and 4 y/o -RRB- during that time were not sold to that idea of leaving them in a daycare center . They were not able to cope up , hence they were always sick , my 4y/o son does n't eat and became thin . My husband told me to resign since it was not ideal for my kids to stay there.I was always absent from work and my superiors began to warn me about it . I had to choose between my family and career . At present , since my children had grown , -LRB- 3.5 y/o and 7y/o now -RRB- my husband told me that i can go back to work , but the only problem now is , if they will still accept me , since it 's been almost 3 years now from my last employment of only 5 months . I really want to go back again , but how ?
I will be very good to her , I know what does it mean to be expat especially without your family but Iam still worried
that 's the point jackiegcalunodmd I know that it will not be easy to be back to my career after several years staying at home but it is still possible ... keep searching ... good luck
I hope so pankajdheer and by the way my daughter is 3 years now and she is attending nursery but she will join the school soon and will be at home earlier that 's why I need somebody to take care of her a few hours until arriving home but leaving her with a housemaid is a little scary
I am a working mom . . and I know my child is in good hands because my mom takes care of her when I go to work ...
thank you mjamille28 for answering ... good for you to have your mom around ... hope getting more answers to share
yes , I am thankful that my mom is with me ... hope you find a trustworthy person to care for your child ...
no other working moms in Qatar ...
It 's best to have someone who very much close to you as you are very sure that your kid/s will be taken care off well . My mom is watching 2 y/o daughter . I do n't have housemaid but we can manage our household chores .
ask referrals from friends or relatives . if somebody is referred it means they do good job .
from KFC direct to bin omran signal , to sport round about , to Al Saad signal , left to Al Saad st. Al Saad Money Exchange and Al Jazeera Money Exchange at left hand side . good luck . .
Try Aldar Exchange near tv round about . Opposite side of Aljazeera Network . It is in the same building with mashreq and IBQ .
walk towards TV R/A , you 'll see Aldar . About one hour walk , LOL !
Walk to wards TV R/A , after Nissan show room and petrol station signal it is just 10minuits by walk , very easy to find Commercial Bank , after that IBQ , then Mashreque , run fast KFC and many joints fr u to spend that money : -RRB-
is back and forth ! LOL !
what is Yo Yo Ma ??? is that a Phillipines or Indian stuff ? :-RRB- -RRB-
I do n't know but I would love to see him perform . He is a gifted musician . I will start looking to see if I can find out . I am glad you asked . I had not heard he was going to be here .
From what I can find , it looks as though the opening events including the Yo Yo Ma concert are by invitation only . Oh well . I would loved to have gone .
Congrats . . I will be completing 6yrs on coming friday but has never got ny surprises ... lOLZZ It would be better for v QLers to advise u for gud hotel if u would have mentioned about the liking for any particular food . . There r many indian , arabic , chinese and many more restuarants in DOHA . . U let us know ur preference and choice first . .

I think it will be best for you to serve your wife with your own hand made food and at night you sit on your bed as your wife was sit on first night , asked her to come in room as you came and enjoy the night in new way . HAVE A NICE DAY WISH U and ALL YOUR FAMILY THE BEST and MAY ALLAH BLESS YOU WITH HIS BLESSINGS .
How old is your child ? You 've got 3 weeks to get your child into a better sleeping routine . It 's not easy , but it is possible . I would suggest skipping afternoon naps and wake your child up earlier than they 're used to . They 'll then start going to bed earlier in the evenings . It may not work for the first few days , but they 'll soon settle into a routine . In fact , you 'll be better off long term , this would make your life alot easier if you had every evening to yourselves . Quality time as a couple is just as important as a family . Hope this helps ! :--RRB- ***** If you have n't got anything nice to say , do n't say anything at all *****

Thanks Snessy . Am trying but babies seem to have their own mind these days . Or maybe my nearly 2years baby boy is one of the stubborn ones . Oh , how I long for those peaceful evenings . Hope I succeed soon .
Saggi ... that is so cruel ... but a good trick ... drmana dance all day wid the baby - play games ... and who knows ... after the baby sleeps that night . . u may want to sleep as well !
ipakistan , Actually I end up being more tired than him everyday . Babies are full of energy. : - -RRB-
especially 2 year old and so cute and full-of-life !
No worries Khanan & drmana , it took me a long time to get my 2 year old into a routine and I still have to go through it everytime we go back to the UK or come back here because of the time difference . I would also suggest giving a bath before bed , it relaxes them and they understand after a while that after a bath I must go to bed . I 'm not an expert , far from it , but this works for me . It 's different for all children , you have to do what works best for you :--RRB- ***** If you have n't got anything nice to say , do n't say anything at all *****
best celebration after 5 years is at home , put children in bed early , do your wife a nice dinner , and spend the whole night talking and remembering all beautiful moments of your life together , you 'll score a big time at the end ;-RRB- p.s. do n't forget some lavender candles in bed room :-RRB- Yalla !

I agree with phoenix2009 ! Get out your wedding album video/dvd and reminisce ;--RRB- ***** If you have n't got anything nice to say , do n't say anything at all *****
Ok why dont you begin with that : - Send her flowers on her work or house wherever she is - Take tomm as an emergency leave from work - Book at Al-Sharq Village a delux room for tonight with a bottle of champaign - have dinner at any of the Hotel 's fancy restaurants - buy her sth Diamond as women adore Diamonds - tomm . morning have your breakfast and use the spa its amazing honestly she 'll be totally amazed `` There are too many ways to die , but only one precious way to live '' N.F SHAKIB

for the quick link ! have u been there ?
Thank you so much guys ... I really appreciate a lot . I was not expecting these many suggestions :-RRB- Thanks again . I am considering the following restaurants for dinner , and as far as the gift is concerned , I will buy her some nice shades , as she lost her last month : 1 -RRB- Ungaare -LRB- Ezdan Towers -RRB- 2 -RRB- LA Veranda -LRB- Sheraton -RRB- 3 -RRB- Pirates Cove -LRB- Sheraton -RRB- Now help me in deciding one of these ... :-RRB- And by the way , I agree with Sonya .

http://marriage.about.com/cs/anniversaries/a/wedannivideas.htm . Current mood : HappY . . .
This is what reality is adeel . . Whatever people have written here , i m not agreed with them at all . . We women have to look after all household chores which leaves really less timing for ourselves . . The day the anniversery arrives , we are still indulge in the same activity no matter we try hard to get rid of some works . . I m not referring the couples who r still living alone . . Its practically impossible for those who r having babies . . I have forgot to think about myself since last 2yrs , the day my baby born . . Candle night dinner , wedding album , indulge in romantic conversation are all like a FAIRY TALE after having babies . . Since u r married as u just said , the least that u can do is to go out in ne good hotel . . And i really wish that ur kid shld be mature enough to sit quiet for sometime . . I m not against of ne such celebrations , but if u will think it practically , its impossible . . So just go out in a really gud hotel , have a proper supper and gift her what she likes most . .
in that case Saggi , u must try it out ... i perfer it over Chingaari ! good choices Adeel ... but i thought u dont like pasta ... La Veranda has all italian food and their pasta is yumm - the view is awesome ! have a lovely day ... do tell us how it went ... do n't forget the flowers ... my personal opinion ... a wife is okay without a gift ... but no flowers on wedding anniversary or birthdays ... i ca n't imagine : -RRB-

Traditional 5th Anniversaries are wood , this can mean lots . From a weekend in a log cabin -LRB- porta cabin ha ha -RRB- , to a romantic walk in local woodlands -LRB- do we have any in Doha ? -RRB- . Modern 5th wedding anniversary gifts are celebrated with silverware . Consider getting a silver ring or a locket that has been engraved .

It 's all subjective , some people are mentioning the best dentist and all . I go to Dr Chaveaux at the French Dental Centre , he 's friendly , professional and understanding , he used the latest technology and when you are on the state of art chair facing you is a monitor that shows you exactly what he is doing or if you prefer he puts a nature program instead . Message me if you want his details -LRB- by they way he does n't over charge -RRB-

You just install the Skype software on your computer . It 's free as is computer to computer calls .

Skype is a telephone and videophone service program ... either way you can download it to your mobile by visiting -LRB- www.skype.com -RRB-
Even if you get hold of skype mobile , it wont work as it is intended to as it is launched by 3mobile for their markets and here Qtel is going to charge you for the data transfer it makes while making skype calls . so technically it works as any other 3.5 g mobile with skype installed in it , if you are badly looking for that skype dedicated button , take any nokia latest e series and assign one of the one touch buttons on it to skype .

Dear If your visa was already stamped cancelled by the immigration = > then there is no need of a exit permit . But , Please make sure that you leave the country within seven days from the date of cancellation of your visa , otherwise every day after these seven days will be considered as over stay and you might then require a exit permit from your sponsor which will be issued by the immigration upon paying fine QR . 10 / - for each over stayed day . Good luck Cheers
Thanks Mr Reyaz , now i have this peace of mind , looking forward on my travel this saturday night . God bless !!

With 8 years exp , I wouldnt say thats a good salary , But you can lead a fairly good life in Qatar with that salary
For 8 years of experience , its not an exciting offer .
Thanks so much to all of you for helping me to make my decision ;--RRB- Also I forget to mention , there is no health insurance in that offer , should I ask to raise the salary because of that or that 's normal in Qatar offers now after the new labor law
You are most welcome

I like to shop and normally I shop online at www.outletiz.com they have only High fashion brands like Armani , Dolce & Gabbana , Sergio Rossi , Prada , Guess , Ra-Re , CNC , Musto , Liu Jo , Tommy Hilfiger , Gucci , Dior , John Richmond , Just Cavalli , La Martina , Dsquared , Ed Hardy , Henleys , Moschino , DKNY , Ice Berg , Energie , Marithe et Francois Girbaud and so much more ...

There 's no permanent treatment for this , only pallative treatment to ease the pain . My 72 years old mother is taking alluperinol & pain killers such as mobic or simply muscadol . But you should consult your doctor because your mother may be taking other medicines and may have drug reactions .
As far as i know therez no permanent cure , ayurvedic and other treatments can reduce the intensity . My friend just 30 years old is suffering from RA .
YES , it is . Did you tried acupressure ? if you need more details , call me 5841088 CK
No cure , but there are ways to minimize the symptions and lesson the damage to the joints . I see a R.A. doctor at Hamad regularly . I am so much better after having started Humira injections every two weeks . I also regularly take methotrexate -LRB- once a week -RRB- . I had been on prednisone but have weaned myself off of that , thank goodness , but at the time , I really needed it . It was the first thing that ever helped me . I call it a miracle drug . Without these medications I was a basketcase . NOw I am fine . I have regular blood tests every 4 to 8 weeks to keep an eye on any problems arising from the medications . My RA was diagnosed in Nov 2008 . Good luck !!
<p> There is no known cure for rheumatoid arthritis , but many different types of treatment can alleviate symptoms and modify the disease process . Alleviating the current symptoms , and preventing the future destruction of the joints with the resulting handicap if the disease is left unchecked .

Samya so far and what I understand , HSBC is a joint venture between UK and Hong Kong banks . But in the end you could say HSBC is from UK . Regards
There really is n't a simple answer for that . It 's headquarters is in london . But it is a Hong Kong Singapore thing . Best thing to do is read this . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSBC
It 's from England -LRB- UK -RRB-
It is a UK / Hong Kong bank . It was set-up in HK during the British rule over there . Standard Chartered bank is the other one . Nevertheless , it is on of the best banks in the world .
its from UK . . uhm . . its in the top 5 of the world 's global corporations . . so its pretty good . . cheers , paul

Take a print-out violation from MOI site and go to Madeena Khalifa Muroor -LRB- Traffic -RRB- office . You can verify by checking the video . If there is mistake , they will accpet it remove it from their system . But , make sure that nobody used your during your vacation . Good luck !
Yes , MOI does make some errors . for example i got a speeding ticket at a time when i was inside my office . u can ssk for pics or proof and also show ur travel documents and they will be more than happy to revert their ticket
They must have given some description on why they have given the ticket like sometimes its overloading of the vehicle or in-appropriate parking or something . And are u sure no one used your car behind you ??
ckect it out from local traffic office , they will show the picture of your car in case you don , t trust them ,
you need 6500 QR salary 6 month bank statement your degree form electricity bill and letter from Sponsor
are you sure it 6500 ?? I have read it on MOI that its 10000 . plz confirm
its sure 10000 Qr not a 6500qr
Your monthly salary upto 10000 QR .
If your salary is not up to the regulation , you can request for your company to help you to sponsor your wife ... They will give you a letter for the MOI .
10000 QR without company accommodation or 7000 QR with company family accommodation .
Check the due amount to pay and if it is above 250 call 111 and ask .
dear friend ... happen same to me almost 7 month ... during register and installion they -LRB- QTEL -RRB- said that 250 permonth ... but i have to pay 285 permonth when received the bill ... keep asking QTEL ... same answer ... always said next month u paid 250 ... already 6 month ... fed up no asking anymore . . just paid 285 permonth .
The promotion probably started a day after your installation , or ended a day before . Even if you prove it , and convince them , QTel does n't do refunds , they 'll keep it in your account for that service .
Sorry guy for posting again . I am using Mozaic TV + which was taken during the promotional period . I am paying only QR . 250 / - per month . I dont think there are hidden charges for QTEL Services . It will be better you call QTEL and inform them about it . They will ask you to pay the bill completely and will give you a credit for the difference which will be adjusted in your next bill .
I called q-tel they told to me if you do n't have land line then will pay landline installation charge.but in the qtel site clearly specified all installation is free . i cut from site that words below . Today Qtel unveil Mozaic TV + service as part of its summer promotion series with substantial discounts for families to entertain themselves while at home . This promotion carries up to QR1290 in savings which includes free installation and free additional channels for two consecutive months . What you think about this ?
I think its mistake from qtel . talk with qtel representive . i also got mozaic and istalation for me is free . so they will definetlly adjust in next bill
And also in advertisement they specified for more information call 111 . then i called this number and asked about the landline installation they told to me all installation charge is free including landline also . yesturday my friend called this number , again they told like that . then why they charged landline installation charge ? . if they charged installation charge then should get all fecilities like : international and mobile calls also . but i got only landline to landline only . at the application time they didi n't ask for which fecilities you needed ? . thatmeans this telephone include this package .125 digital TV channels Basic channels + Additional channels -LRB- 2 month free -RRB- + 512 MB speed network connection + home telephone -LRB- landline to landline -RRB- .

Article 54 , Labor Law .
Thank you so much MagicDragon . Does that mean they have to give the EoSB -LRB- min . 3 weeks -RRB- even if it 's not mentioned in our actual contract ? Is it Law that a small non-govenment company has to give a Letter of No Objection if they end your contract 5 month before the contract finishes due to their not having work ? Also : a -RRB- If I/we cancel our RP and leave the country without a No Objection letter , is there any restrictions on me -LRB- or our family -RRB- being allowed back into the Country on a Visitor 's Visa , obtained from the airport ? b -RRB- If work cancels my RP whilst we are out of the country , and we do n't have a No Objection letter , can we enter the country again on a visitors visa obtained at the airport ? Is there any site to go to and check your status of RP ? How would you be notified if your RP had been cancelled ?
Yes , in order for your company to have opted OUT of the end-of-service gratuity it would have to be in your contract . Otherwise , it 's there . Secondly , I do n't know of any rules that say companies must give an NOC in such-and-such circumstances . It seems to be totally up to their discretion . Finally , if you have been on a family visa you do n't need an NOC to re-enter after your RP is canceled/expired . Only the worker needs an NOC and he/she ALWAYS needs an NOC within the two year time frame . Mandi

HHHHHHHHHHHMMMMMMMMMM . I think Brit is the right person to ask when it comes to KIA . LOL
yeah , I know where 's the Ramada junction and know where 's the fly over Dring so I guess Kia is somewhere close to Nissan-Renault dealer , right ?
On the Salwa Road , where Nissan is on your left side , go straight pass the flyover , 1st roundabout take the 2nd exit -LRB- 12 o'clock -RRB- , you will pass the Mercedes showroom , futher down you will see a Mitsubishi showroom , 2nd roundabout , take 12 o'clock again , and maintain on your right side , take either the 2nd or 3rd junction to the right , and the KIA showroom is nearing the end of that small road .
go over the flyover , past the decoration R/A , continue straight after about 2 R/A you will find KIA motors on your right , if you miss it , not to worry , there is another KIA showroom after the next R/A . . again on the right
Check the Google Map , Please . If going down Al Muntazah from City Centre , this KIA dealer is 50 meters before Al Aziziyah Round about , on your right . and this Al Aziziya Roundabout is the junction of Sports City Street and Al Muntazah .
just look on doha-dealerships . com
Hi guys , thanx for the answer , but since I am a rookie here , could you be more specific ? Salwa road is a labyrinth for me at the moment , thanx again
32 '' Sony bravia , weighs around 22Kg only with original packing . I 'm not sure the original packing will be safe enough to put as a luggage . You may use another packing over the original packing and fill with clothes to absorb any shockes during rough handling . The weight and size is ok as luggage in passenger a flight . But not suitable for hand baggage as it 's size is more than permittable for hand baggage .
The brand which i have is that Samsung . i got it for special price -LRB- 1399 -RRB- along with wall bracket . so i felt it would be cheaper to send as its on a special price :-RRB- . .
why r u taking it to india dude , u get the same piece for a bit more and are assured of a 3 year warranty ... and also a lot more accessories . I was in india in jan and was surprised that toys and electronics are priced almost the same ... hope this helps
There are so many Door to Door service personnel in doha , check with them , I 'm sure they will send the same safely . if u find any , do n't forget to post the details here so that others can also think of your innovative idea ...
I can send contact -LRB- yadu -RRB- QNT Cargo 3249842 email yadu.qntcargo@dtco-qatar.com
I think it will be much better to buy it in India as the price difference is reasonable and you will get service as well as warranty . If you are taking it from here to India either you have to take it with you or you have to send it by air or sea cargo . It is bulky and heavy to handle it at the airports . I think a 32 '' LCD TV will weigh more than 20kg . If you are sending it by cargo they will pack it for you and I think it will cost you approximately Qr . 800 / - -LRB- pls check with any cargo -RRB- including freight -LRB- air -RRB- and customs duty and if you spend one third of that with the price you are paying here for the TV you will get it delivered in your house with service and warranty in India .
the best is by DHL good luck
Buy SONY Bravia . It 's the best brand in the market . Prices of LCD TV now are very cheap . Gud luck !
Yes you can do that . You can have it in your luggage when you go home . nothing will happen and it will not damage the TV . just make sure to have it tightly packed . Do n't send it by air or sea freight because they will charge you too much . Gud luck !
Samsung is way better than Sony Bravia . If you are getting it free as a gift fine , otherwise why would you buy and ship it from Qatar ???? . Its cheaper in india .
I think his question is not to compare the LCD TV brands .

hey Ice Maiden , do n't know how to explain this . . but will try my best 1 - Fechlewe asked about some Qatari words that starts with Sub . . and king_qatar explained to him what Su exactly means . . i guess u get this part :P 2 - nasserqtr gave another example that i found funny to an extent . . which was which literally means `` pour some water on the wide beans ... but in arabic . . sub el may ala el bajila . . and i found a bit funny 3 - king_qatar posted a poem and said the last letter of that poem . . which is some how a known challenge to the next poster to post a poem that starts with letter that his poem ended with and thats what i did hope u get me

sub means `` to pour '' and subb lak alkahwa = to pour coffee for you so any drink or liquid can use that word with or even casting concrete subb kharasana hope that helps

Digg under your chair , you 'll find oil and gas at a better terms and conditions .
Rightly pointed out , that is an underutilized and overlooked source that can easily be converted to usable energy in Qatar . Perhaps the reason behind this is an abundance of other natural resources available for use , leaving an alternative source not much important in present scenario . Nevertheless , I think if such source could be ` sold ' to the authorities , there are all the chances for the decision makers to sit up and take notice .

You just have to follow the signage which takes you to immigration counters upstairs . Before stairs you have to do eye scan , then give your form at payment counter , they will charge you entry fee with that receipt go to Immigration counter
Top of the stairs on the left as you enter the passport hall is the pay booth .
What sort of visa are you getting . Visa on arrival or a pre-arranged visa ?

Have you been drinking too much wine ... does such wine exist and if so what is the point ? That is like having a car without any wheels and an invitation to the Playboy mansion with only 10 mintues to get there ...
Wine is a wine ...
its called sparkling grapejuice my friend ... LoL
Yes such a thing exists , just like for beer - they make it as usual then use one of several processes to remove the alcohol without removing the distinctive taste . LOL I would liken it to a car with no emissions rather than no wheels !!! Some people , for medical , religious , driving or other reasons -LRB- my mum for example gets drunk after a thimble-full of wine -RRB- like to enjoy the taste of wine without the alcoholic effects . Here is a website selling it , but I want it here in Qatar !!! I would have thought that with all the rich arabs around , there would be a demand for it ... .
LOL most of the non alcoholic beers do indeed taste appalling , more like horlicks , however as a previously committed beer drinker and member of the Campaign for Real Ale , I can say that some alcohol free beers are acceptable . The key to it is de-alcoholising a fully fermented malt , rather than halting the fermentation early , which leaves it sweet-tasting . In doha the only one that is ok is holsten , but others exist outside doha . still waiting for someone to point me in the right direction !
No way out . you are stuck
you better try again with your boss , because with out his permission you have noway to go to another job
Srry to tell u so , but as he said , either you go country for 2 years or you bare working at his place !!! Gd luck !
Really !!!!!!!!! Bad luck . Any how try to convenience your boss for getting NOC , because you are a manager there , is it ? or work with them .

very bad services and spareparts . . i guess . others are OK and i like its 4X4 what about the prices ?
Hi , I have an older 2003 model . It drives very well . No problems . I bought it because it 's more compact than the large Toyotas . Drives more like a car . Steering & handling good . Power is good . 4.0 ltr V6 is well tried & tested . This is the biggest selling SUV in America for many years . No problems at all with service & none for spare parts if you visit the Ford Service centre . I was just out there on Saturday to get a new cap for the brake master cylinder reservoir which some-how went missing . They looked it up on the computer - cost was QR10 . Plus a new rubber bumper for the rear door latch was also missing - again no problem at all . Cost QR5 .
you are all a great help guys ... now I 'm thinking again between ford and gmc ... thanks for advise and all the best !
Ford service is below acceptable . GMC are way better in service . But if I were you I would hold on to that thought . Who knows what will happen ? These companies are on the brink of bankruptcy . I myself have an american car , so nothing against the cars , it 's the timing .
GOOD CAR , I RUN AND OWN A 2006 MODEL , NO PROBLEMS GOOD FOR DOHA ROAD CONDITIONS . 4.0 L BUT ECONOMICAL TO RUN . ONLY DOWN SIDE IS NO CD , 2007 ONWARDS HAVE CD . STRUGGLED WITH A/C IN THE SUMMER WHEN SAT IN TRAFFIC ONCE ON THE MOVE IT WAS FINE .
thanks bro but how 's the steering ? the maneuver and wheel bent ? does the power steering is smooth to handle ?
Power Steering is smooth and everything is okay . The only thing that i hate is Service Centre for FORD is suckss . Too slow and took 2 days for changing engine oil ? If u have any other trouble . . it will takes at least 1 week before u can get back your car . . suckss
Driving Ford vehicles No problem everything is good power steering exceelent , robust etc ... ... ... . Except the maintainence cost .
working fine with me . you need to check your sound settings .
Check your sound setting in gtalk . If theres an option for automated volume contol then uncheck it .
the same issues was with my PC also . that was related to my LAN settings . -LRB- in my Office -RRB- . My network admin was blocked the gtalk service from the gateway . -LRB- Gtalk will be connected and type chat is possible . . but the mic will not work . -RRB- i hope the same issues was diturbing you also . check with your network admin .
i think the problem is with mic settings in your computer see this <AÂ HREF=http://www.ceveni.com/2009/02/microphone-not-working-with-gtalk-and.html> http://www.ceveni.com/2009/02/microphone-not-working-with-gtalk-and.html </A> if this doesnt work you might have to go for start -- > controlpanel -- > sounds -- > mic and change settings by clicking the mic checkbox

From my experience in Qatar , never ask for directions in QL coz it 'll confuse you . Do n't get me wrong , QL ` ers are very helpful but the best way is to get a GPS system , do a coordinate search for a particular destination and whalla ! . Tha ` ts how I get my way around in Qatar .

Hey mate , the Fingerprints dept. is currently located in Lusail . the location is as follows : if the new exhibition centre is on your right hand side and ahead of you is the pearl island then keep straight ahead of the zig zag tower -LRB- leaving in on your right hand side -RRB- after the zig zag tower you 'll find a round about , make a right from there and you 'll find Golf Club on your right side . keep straight until u find the last roundabout on that road . make a right from the last r/a -LRB- theres only way to right & left from there -RRB- and keep straight until you find a petrol station on your right -LRB- Wasil Petrol Station -RRB- then make a left from that pertrol station R/A . keep straight then make left again from the next r/a and there you 'll find this finger print dept on your right hand side . tc .

Gets sick of the religious nutjobs .
mj , I agree , but that 's when you are off-line .
When the religious and Cheating posts start getting too much and lead to verbal abuse between contributors ... as has been happening recently .
Recently ? You mean ALL the time . Since when has n't there been religious strife and arguing and personal attacks on QL ?
I think the personal attacks have increased lately , especially between a select few members . .
I do n't know . I 've been on this site almost 4 years now and this is nothing new . The people change , but the personal attacks remain the same .
Maybe because they are fed up of verbal fight and religious posts . When they think that they are too involved with this virtual people and they got better things to do in Life . . When QLing affects your work efficency . Personal problem with any of the members . When you loose interst . .

I think QL is the most helpful thing I ever came across while I was in Qatar . When work colleagues do n't have time for you , your employer does n't care a shit and you are homesick and lonely in the middle of a desert -LRB- studded by tall towers which are as cheerless as the rest of the desert is -RRB- , there no friend like Qatar living ... ...

Its these thick headed and ego type religious fanatics that prompt some to leave many times .

Everything s in their hand , they given only some HOPE ... can not predict . .

I attended interview on 24th May ... got call on Thursday ... same old details they took from me . . experience , notice period , blah blah ... and said they will get back to me in a week 's time ... dont know how long ... patience patience ...
You can expect call ... it may take many weeks or more than a month ... it takes almost 60days for them to finish all the process . My interview went very well ... all d best
How long we can sit with patience ? ... . expecting 3 more months ... .
No , i m yet to get offer letter from them . No idea how may weeks or months will take for me to get all the process done . no news from Qatar Airways or Yet lets hope for the best . . Insha allah .
hi ... Has any one got any update or received offer from DIA ... ??
If you have `` Wasta '' , your offer Letter would be released within a week , other wise have Patience & hope for the best . .
hi friends my name is ajay from Kuwait , I have offer from Qatar oil corp and I received appointment letter . but in that letter they mention `` please contact DELUXE TOURISM SERVICES '' for further process and paper work and visa process and I received one more letter from DELUXE TOURISM SERVICES in which mentioned `` please send 1370 $ so that they can start further process . . please guide me This is ok or ?
As we told you a month back - the recruitment of expats was cancelled because Qataris want first pick of the jobs at the airport . Try looking for a job elsewhere .
Air India Express is hiring pilots . I wish they recruit new airhostesses . Fed up of seeing airhostess with mushtache in airindia flights :-LRB-
No reply yet ... Still fingers crossed ...
Serious answer . Recruitment in Qatar is a long process so do n't be surprised if it is 3 months plus before you hear anything . -LRB- In the meantime grow your moustache to improve your chances ... -RRB-
me also saw the ad . but no more details
Yeah Last wednesday morning , i got the shock , when is aw hoards of people working in Doha walking to Oryx Rotana and in notime Rotana was looking like a railway station in India . Then realised that they all had come for interviews for NDIA jobs where recruitment was going on , on the 1st floor of Oryx Rotana . Later they ended up collecting all candidates CV , s and told them - they will call them later , which provided some space in the hotel for the people staying there . I guess this Question is related to the above . But wonder how people working here can switch jobs locally without NOC or all these people on visit visa hunting for jobs ?
ricky they all were job less and i was one of them : D
Thanks for ur Comments ... I think now onwards they will stop this type of open days ...
I thought I saw in the job ad that you had to be on an RP for the interview , and not a visit visa . Or am I wrong ? But if so , how will these people get NOCs to work at the airport ? Would n't it be much easier for NDIA just to hire people directly from overseas than locally in Qatar ?
sTILL waiting for the call :-LRB-
The locals are complaining that they did not get a chance to attend this even for a major employer in Qatar and I tend to agree with them . No advertisments were made in the local papers targeting the Qatari population . I suggest REED may have to delay any hiring of expats for quite a while now ...
NDIA is separate from Qatar Airways , they are recruiting for different jobs
I thought that was originally called the Kerela Recruitment Forum for jobs at the new airpor .
yea ajay take care , i search google about `` DELUXE TOURISM SERVICES '' but did n't get a clear picture .
are they taking CVs in CAA builing ??
contact QOC directly and have confirmations from them about the jobs , , !!! try call them on phone in no way they take money like this
where i can send my cv ? im from phil . . tnx
ENvY mE my freind how are you .
I am an B com graduate person now i am looking job .

we all might know that according to your mind but according to my mind no one knows the Black people stare more At mens then pathans , this is true that black people Ate nepalies etc in news ... they really humans or type of humans ????? everything is true nothing is false
I 'm a friend who will not walk behind you that i may not follow ; neither in front of you that i may not lead but i will walk beside you and be your friend till the end !
what i said is fact & i observed myself . there 's nouse of getting angry , are you from one of them who run after stinky nepali chicks , if not so why annoying : -RRB-
hahaha wat a gayish comment haha and more wat a gayish topic . . come on man man stop staring woman you are talking about deep shit stop doing it and you die hahaha come on be a man for a sec and think over it again ... and tell you one thing when gurls see you -LRB- like stare -RRB- you will say shez a b * t * h no one wana be call B thing
asif who says its lust . . man stare coz they care hahahahaha u have to believe after all this love shit u need to do the lusty thing so cut it short
Some men stare openly at men too .
thirdly ... women dont stare openly at men then how the heck they know that men are staring openly at them ? you see this has to work both ways . . both need to make eye contact with each other to know who is openly staring at who .
`` stares openly '' means what ??
staring with eyes wide shut !
Khattak you can always say `` LOL ''
You are writting all your experience in this post ... I would like to one thing in the statement ... . . staring with eyes wide shut n mouth round open ... .
you see thru your mouth ?
opening mouth and eyes together means ... ... ?????? May be smoke can explain better ...
Men also stare at computer screen like I m doin it now `` Computer screen stare ''
I men are behind the women . then , even if they stare . . It should n't matter ... should it ?
Painther you are sick ! Staring alone is not allowed . . staring ... er i mean sharing is caring !
the ones who stare from behind have a butt fetish .
Wise men staring at women on computer screen are more vernurable to loosing their eye sight coz of too much exposer ... . . I mean exposer to light
If i knew i could get hala cards for staring at men i would not have changed my sim from hala to shahry ! Damn it QL always giving information at the wrong time !

According to the rules in this Islamic society the woman should walk 3 meters BEHIND the man . So , who is staring at whom in Qatar ??
why men stare bcoz ... If men dont stare the women then it will be waste of time for women who spend hours to dress up nd do make up for men ... so men dont want to waste the precious time of women .
You should go out more if you think women do n't stare
You are wrong . I 've asked hundreds of women why they 'd put on make-up . They all said : `` I do it for myself . '' Liars , all of them ?
Mens stare coz we care ! : -LRB-
You 've chosen your avatar wisely , Rizks . Bingo .
LP i can stare with my 2 eyes , unlike you ... : -LRB-
PATHANS specially are not allowed to say anything , coz they stare at men more than women , its in their nature & sensibility . i have seen lot of nepalese with pathans & judged . when i asked 1 , why is like that . He said , pathan is dangerous as friend as well as enemy , they attack in both the cases ! heheheee rest is upto you guys how u pick what i said .
RofL RS !
Refined Soul ! The thread is about men isnt ? But what are you talking about ?
oh my starry eyed surprise
nop , women stares at me .
If you call a pest control company , for sure youll get rid of them , but if you spray pure dettol to the bed itll also prove to be effective .
There are several things you can do . 1 . sprinkel your bed with pif paf powder and after it having been on your matress , hovver it up . 2 . do the above , then let it sit out in the sun for several hours . 3 . buy a new matress . I also recommend you treat your house and get the pest control in . You can google to find more info on this suject matter ! Good luck
If they are in your house you are screwed . I have had these before and wouldnt wish them on my worst enemy . Google bed bugs for the tips . You need to take this seriously and buy a new mattress .
First of all find out who carry them to your bed ??? May be you !!!
You need to do pest control to eliminate it completely , try MATAR CHEMICAL CO. -LRB- PEST CONTROL -RRB- , i have used their service for this problem and it was found to be very effective . I paid around 350 , after that I have never had the problem , try calling Deryk on 5871009 . Hope your problem is take care of ASAP , good luck !
Call Boecker Public Safety company on 444 37 44 , and they will solve all your bedbugs problems ... their treatment is very effective and not harmful
It 's advisable to change the house now .
Find a new house ... ...
that depends on your budget basically , there are lots of gifts based on the budget , such as nice pair of watches for bride and groom , if they are setting up a new house , then a good dinner set or some other house hold items , or some gold ring , like that there are endless list .
Dancing couple doll
set of watch for the couple along with a nice greeting card
watches , showcase items etc. ... just think and u wil get a gud option ...
minimum 3 months bank statement required as per the requirements , but sometime less than that will also do , if u are salary is above 7000QR getting family visa is not a matter of worry .
hope this helps :-RRB- You will be given a form to complete with a list of the relevant documents : approval letter from work , bank statement of salary for the last six months -LRB- for non-government employees -RRB- , marriage certificates , children 's birth certificates and education certificates -LRB- although you do n't always need these in practice -RRB- . The last three should be certified , but in practice you probably do n't need to . Photocopies are acceptable . You also need passport photos of yourself , your spouse and your children .

no six month is not mandatory , i got my family visa within 2 months of my arrival here in Qatar , so it all depends .
hms . . so 6 months is just formality ? are you working in private sctor or government ?
Dear Friends Thank you very much you all for your inputs
Or better yet , stop using for now . If not , maybe the food you eat ...
Azi , thanks . Do you have any idea about foods that can cause -LRB- or may trigger -RRB- hair loss ? I have also thought about that because since I came here my diet has changed from what I used to eat back home .
Go back to Micronesia for a month or so and see if it makes any difference . If it does , never come back . If it does n't , stay another month and get it treated by a good dermatologist .
too much of everything is bad . Egg , chicken , nuts ... anything oily , perhaps ?
If u are eating out regularly -LRB- I do -RRB- or otherwise and think that not much proteins are going into your system get some protein supplements . Atleast it stopped hair fall for me -LRB- dont ask me how and why as I have no medical support to prove it ... some guy from Nutrilite spoke to me and suggested , I followed and it worked -RRB- . But again you may not take my word and decide for yourself .
next time rinse your head with bottle water . More better if its Evian .
Prism Thanks man . That 's exactly what I need . Some proven personal/home remedy . Because I have actually tried some medication before asking you guys but it did n't work . And I do n't have the time to try or experiment on all the available meds out there .
You should be asking which Bank is the least evil of all
Try Commercial Bank and they are GOOD !! All the BEST !!
commercial bank - bigger thieves ahli bank - smaller thives so go for ahli bank
Qatar National Bank is best in qatar , open a/c in QNB , you will enjoy !
non of them is a good bank . But I can suggest to open an account in the bank which have more branches open during the day . - Qatar National Bank . - Comercial Bank Of Qatar . - Doha Bank . if you want islamic bank I recomend Qatar national bank Islami wish you the best
I think -LRB- when I took a loan from HSBC -RRB- you will have to pay a high interest during the first year if you want to clear your loan . After the first year you pay only 1 % on the balance amount and get a clearance letter . But it is always better to check with the customer service at the bank as sometimes rules change and each bank may have their own policy . However , Qatar Central bank Set the rules , so be sure the bank is not ripping you off .
yes they do apply a penalty . and i think it 's 1 or 2 % of the remaining amount without interest . So basically if you had to pay 100 QR -LRB- no interest included -RRB- you will end up paying 101 QR . They apply this penalty because they are not entitled to charge you the interest anymore . Banks ... ca n't live with them , ca n't live without them ...
They apply the penalty because by repaying your loan early they are not making any more money off the loan -LRB- in the form of interest -RRB- .
is it same for car loan also ?
1 % charges . . i did the same but Ahli S *** ing us
It 's the same for all loans
The procedure is simple but it takes some time . You will go to Ahli and tell them that you want to Repay your loan in full . They will make the paperwork and contact you . Normally there are no taxes besides the leftover amount you have to pay back . But this is Qatar ... nothing is normal when it comes to banking . So they might charge you ... why do n't you just give them a call and ask .
yv2R the Xilisoft Untimate Media Converter is quite good , http://www.xilisoft.com/ combine , split , convert etc. .
They are everywhere on the internet ... Quick Question ... is there an Anti-Piracy law in Qatar ?
Amthrope , thank u very much , do they have trial version to know properly , I tried Zealot , it was ok but when u join Zealot name was in the middle and says it will get cleard after we buy
try Windows Movie Maker , its ok for starters ...
are you using a windows or mac or linux ?
Not always good . They are not consistent with their food quality & taste . But ... worth of giving a try .
Very nice and delicious food . Around 50 each .
Food is ok , price is QR 48 / - per head , above 4years and below 8years they charge half , Mineral water and Beverages separate not included in Buffet
no its illegal here . .
I do n't think it would EVER exist in a Muslim country . `` I 'd love to change the world , but I ca n't find a big enough diaper ''
go to any pharmacy and ask for one , they have every name brand . Try the brand EPT -LRB- stands for Early Pregnancy Test ! -RRB- .
take any brand insallah it willl help you to know
are you preg puff ? whew !
Yes , go to any pharmacy and buy the kits -LRB- which uses urine -RRB- . But if you want to have the most accurate test to detect early pregnancy , then you 've got to have a blood test to detect your beta-HCG levels .
Any pharmacy is the best way to get this kit . . Good Luck , , ,
Try clear blue ... . It really works
hi , check the power settings .
Its obviously a power problem ! Check the socket , fuse and cable , you may have a faulty cable
actually im not using my battery because its worn out so i directly plug in ... <!--break-->
1 . toshibas have this bad rep of overheating . check if your fan is working . your laptop 's cooling system might 've accumulated lots of dust . Jarir 's toshiba service centre will charge you 200 bucks to run so called `` diagnostics '' . All your laptop needs is a bit of spring cleaning ! :D 2 . Also check your RAM modules . If you have multiple modules -LRB- like two 1GB chips -RRB- , one may have gone busted ! Try alternating your modules and running your laptop !

You need to Repeat the First Digit to call your friend For Example : > A Education Centre in Qatar gave you number 2 years ago : 4212590 . You could dial +974-4212590 . > But now you have to dial +974 -4 -4212590 . -LRB- Be Careful to understand what I said , It is repeating the digit and not adding any 4 -RRB- .

Good question coz one of my frnd 's is looking for the same thing as well .
Simsigat , where in Doha , exactly ?
I am not sure if you will find Proactive in Qatar . Skincare is something which the consumers have a sort of loyalty . A consumer who is using Clinque , Clarins or Lancome products are not going to change to a new brand even if it is having very good products or marketing strategy . It will be difficult for a Brand like Proactive to survive in a niche skincare market like Qatar . It will be better if you can buy it on line or arrange with someone to buy it from US .
why hunting for proactive ? if you are having any facial issue , just try some very simple but great results home remedies.its easy and doest cost a lot . good luck
I 'm pretty sure you will have to order it or ask someone to bring it from the US .
i think u can get proactiv products in Boots Pharmacy in viallagio or land mark i m not sure but u can try
I do n't know how but I am enjoying it in English , just to rub it in a bit : P
That game was an absolute disgrace - players intent on getting each other sent off , more activity on the bench than on the field , MORONinho acting like the petulant child that he is - Spanish football at its cheating , lying , snide worst - `` Great game '' - common Brit , Id rather watch Accrington Stans v Port Vale !! If thats the best thats on offer , better neither of them turn up at Wembley for the final and United just take the trophy by default . The contrast between Tueasday nights game and Wednesday nights game was stark . Its little wonder to me that the football naive fans of the Middle East are taken in by Spanish football .
Al Jazzera +9 had English Commentary the usually it i son +3 which last night was in French WTF . Anyway a new octopus had yesterday predicted that Real Madrid in the Final . Well going by last night score it will be a mountain to climb at Nou Camp for Real to overcome a 2-0 deficit .
@ Milybar , you got lucky mate , i must 've inadvertantly ticked `` French '' & `` Arabic '' in my Qtel application , ` cos that 's all i got , +9 was French for me ... As for the game itself , absolutely digraceful performance by Madrid , `` Jose Mourinh
gadarene , Opps sorry forgot to mention that I was watching through the Al Jazeera satelite channels and not Qtel Mozaic . Maybe a request can be made by the concerned to Qtel to change the commentry to English for the next week game !
Renting law in Qatar states that if your RP is cancelled the landlord must refund all paid rents and return the cheques . The normal notice period is 1 month but you are not responsible if you are fired without notice and your RP cancelled . These people are crooks , dont let them take you for a greedy ride .
Deposit amount ... Yes but , about the taken back the checkes b4 the end of the leasing contract ... depends on the contract between the two parties . . but usually this issue can be solved by posting an early termination letter to the lanlord befor 2-3 month from the date of leaving . Watching yoo
As I know legally you shall pay for entire contract period and the land lord will not be in need to return your cheque . But here the land lords will be very happy when they understand you are leaving since they can give to some one for higher rent . In addition they will get rent amount for one or two months from the date of vacating . -LRB- Free rent -RRB- . If you are lucky u will get back your cheques without any deduction . But remember u r in qatar .
them roof , them rules ! you compmain about it , get deported !
Because some nationalities are more likely to bring over elderly relatives to take advantage of the healthcare that is provided here . And those same nationalities are less likely to come and visit here and spend lots of money on accomodation , shopping etc. . Unless you are contributing to the economy , either as a wage earner or a high spending tourist , you are n't really welcome here . And if your parents are that age , you should be visiting them , not vice versa .
Seniors Both my parents as well as my inlaws have come here to visit our family . All 4 people were well in their 70 's , so do n't think that is the rule .
Ah deedee it depends on your nationality !!!
The medical liability is an issue for them . However , you can get them to visit you . All you need is a special permission from the Captain at the immigration .
Yes , you need to talk to the Authorised person in the visa office to get a special permission . I did for my mother and without any hassel he signed my documents .
I read a post from deedee that all his parents and the in-laws above 70 years were able to visit Qatar . deedee it depends on your Nationality and I know yours . It will not be the same for someone from Asia . They should approach the concerend Officers to special approvl for it .
Ah !! Come on people , the place where I am from is where a lot gulf citizens go seeking a healthcare !!! Moreover , I wo n't ask parents to come here if they are on a wheelchair ???? Both are still healthy and very well , was John McCain 72 ? And a lot of political characters over 65 ? Are they entitled to have a visa to Qatar ?? Anyway , everyone comes here to Qatar hi is very likely to spend ; he will not come if he does n't spend , and to `` rami-leb '' ... yeh you bet , how could I forget such a solution ? I have to visit them , thx for advice and I appreciate your idea >> > finally thx for every one has answered my q.
Well I do n't believe it has anything to do with the health care issue . First of all HMC only treats for free those who have a health card and therefore they must be residents not visitors , if you do n't have a health card you 'll pay for whatever treatment you get except for emergencies . Second thought let us say it was really all about health care issues and not providing the emergency cases for free to sick elders who are none residents then simply the sponsor could be asked to sign a form where he will be responsible for any unsettled treatment payments for a visiting relative , or perhaps those over a certain age could pay in the airport a health insurance fee , instead of simply not allowing the elderly - who should be treated with more respect honestly - to enter . After all what 's the median age of the parents of working residents here ? 40 ? I do n't think so . But as some people say it 's their roof , their country , let them do with it what ever they want .
TRAVELLING BY CAR IS QUITE EASY , AFFORDABLE AND ENJOYABLE . BUT A BIT EXPENSIVE COMPARING TO BUS TRAVEL . BUT THIS IS QUITE EASY AND FOR THE ROADS THESE ARE EXCELLENT . YOU WILL HAVE TO RECHECK YOUR VEHICLE BEFORE TRAVELLING . ESPECIALLY THE TYRES . AND EVEN IF YOU DO N'T KNOW THE ROUTES , JUST NO PROBLEM -LRB- EITHER TAKE GPS OR YOU WILL HAVE TO TRAVEL ON THE HIGHWAY STRAIGHT . AND YOU CAN ASK ANYONE ON THE GAS STATION IN THE WAY , THEY WILL GUIDE YOU . TRAVELLING ON YOUR OWN CAR WILL BE A GREAT EXPERIENCE . HAVE A NICE TRIP THANKS
Thanks to all of you for your favourable suggestions ... . God Bless You

Give the priest a beautiful envelope ... Inside it put a note `` Thank You '' ... make sure the envelope is sealed ... lol
r v invited
Cost for the ceremony is free . Just fix the time with the priest . In our custom if any one want to marry in church they have to fulfill the following requirements : 1 - Pre-marriage course certificate 2 - Letter from the parish priest -LRB- current , if working -RRB- , stating that , you are registered with that parish and have no wife and kids for the best of -LRB- priest 's -RRB- knowledge . 3 - Letter from the bride 's parish priest stating the above . 4 - 2 witness If you wan na marry in Qatar , u and ur would-be will have to give your native parish priest 's letter -LRB- NOC -RRB- to the priest in Doha .
you also have to inform the priest three weeks prior for the marriage announcements to be made in church
kabayan , you better call and ask the catholic church here in qatar ... they have their own website . . google it ... they can give you the right answer to your question regarding fees for church wedding ...
Um , if its Roman Catholic it should be free ! You can just speak with the priest and make a subtle offering to them which is up to you . They may ask you not to bring in flowers etc and it is really just up to you . If you have it outside of Italy then you will have to have all your documents etc sent off to the Vatican for registration and they will want to know details about your local diocese . Congratulations and best of luck . If I can offer any advice to folks getting married is do n't spend large on flowers and decorations -LRB- apart from for the brides bouquet , it will be in lots of photos -RRB- and do spend up large on the photographer as you will want quality .

Why ? Are you racist against Pakistani lamb ?
we are talking of M E A T ? My goodness ! What 's next Moza ?
they do have it in carrefour
even the medium-size neighbourhood supermarkets has .
Well , I follow Paleo diet ; therefore , I am after grass fed meat which is likely impossible in Qatar . I used to in Australia where mostly cattle are grass fed . I know , they ca n't export their grass fed animals because they do n't look healthy physically but still Aussie meat will be somewhat grass-fed .
section ?
Aussie lamb ? I hear they share their sheep :O -LRB-
Britexpat : Here is the difference between Lamb , Mutton or Sheep http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_and_mutton
VANMOST , I found Australian Lamb at Mira that is very fatty but so nice in taste . It is about 15 QR per Kilo . When I read what you said about grass fed animals and how importers do not prefer it , I thought maybe that lamb is grass fed , that 's why it 's less in price and has more fat . Please reply because I was looking for grass fed meat since I arrived in Qatar last year but no way the stores will tell you what kind of food animals have . If that Mira lamb is grass fed it will be the greatest news for me , since it tastes nice and much less in price than other meats .
check with ElSenin at nasser street opposite to Gardenia and gulf colour .
peace !
I guess , you have to watch your words . Pakistani grass fed animals are seen in villages only or in northern areas , they are not exported to anywhere . Most of the to-be-exported animals are fed corn or grains .
Vanmost , now , I do not know this for sure , but I have been told that meat from NZ is all grass fed .
And good luck doing Paleo here ... I would not even try to accomplish that here . It 's hard enough to find stuff for a normal diet .
@Nomerci ... As I told earlier , grass fed animals do n't look healthy and they got yellow fat as well . Therefore , mostly importers do n't want that meat because consumers are not aware of facts . So , every exporter has to give some grains and corn to
I find the Australian meat in Doha tough . I buy NZ beef and lamb . Mandi
Aussies , NZ lamb with Indian and Pakistani . The A&NZ is huge in size . . but the Indians and pakistani ' z are skinnies ... so which is the good one . . -LRB- confused -RRB- ... Dear Moza Frankly speaking I dont like those RACIST European and US meats ... they all are similar like you ... filled with poisons . .
forget our Britexpat 's infamous Cuban Shotputter : -RRB-
Just would like to know about any trustworthy and cheapest calling facility to talk quite often and for longer time in phone from Qatar to Cuba .
Those lingering memories of my Cuban Shotputter :O -LRB- And yes , You can use Skype ...
SKYPE
Hahahah Brit . . You mean direct phone calls from skype to phone as Cubans also have same problem with internet as Iranians . The person living in Cuba has less internet access . .

PTV SPORT ON ASIASAT3
it 's available on mozaic tv pahela channels .
Ok that 's annoying . I am not paying for a bunch of Indian channels just for the cricket . Will have to stick to watching it online then !
the Pehla TV is so worth it . CricOne is doing a great job having less commercials and more on-time sports coverage .
Its getting telecasted on Pehla package ... Cricone -LRB- Channel 634 -RRB-
i dont think they changed the graphic card ... they changed the chips inside to use less power n generate less heat ... like they did from falcon to jasper . Havent seen it in qatar yet ... Take Care : -RRB-
I just saw one today , in a store out here at the `` private airport '' How much are you willing to pay for it ?
Pay scale is what count , not title .
no dude profession is a factor
No you ca n't get a visa if profession is Labor , If u change the profession then it will be possible simple .
Never !! unless u change your visa status to the required status by the labour dept such as Office in charge , manager , engineer , doctor etc. . . Or try something else . . guess : -RRB-
It is possible . I know somebody whose profession is Labour but has family here and owns 3 cars . fat bank account . mingled with society . Do not say no If you do n't know real stories .
Through proper channel no way , it is better to change your Profession first .
Labor profession are not allowed to sponsor family either for visit visa or family visa .

How about with the spare part ? it 's easy and cheap ?
spare Parts are average in price , only problem you need a lot of them .
expensive maintenance . .
no they dont . if you want to be sure take the spare from the vehicle before the test . So many Qataris do n't have spares anyway !
No they dont check the spare tyre .
Ensure that he has the right qualification and strong experiences especially in oil & gas background . These companies mentioned are very selective . However all the best .
Not a biggie , they are small but to be fair pay stupid money
Please google it . U will find so many websites and blogs as ready made answers for your questions . -LRB- : Have grt time .
if there is kids zoo and parks will be good
visit Katara and Sealine
Try using the search box .
al emadi hospital . . dr.rafah she is quite gud i just had to visit her some few days baq and i must say she is gud . . dont go to ahli they have long waiting queues and u get fed up until ur turn comes as u have to be a walk in becuze appointments are not available till june for most of the doctors . . dr qudsia is also gud but she is not covered by insurance
As i know Dr. Kudzia is very good . for my wife both kids we went to her and she is very friendly , listening to you and very good . If some one ask i am not hesitate to recommend her .
If you are looking a well experienced OBGYN , then the answer is Dr. Khudisia and the clinic is located on Al Saad - Villagio road . If you drive from Alsaad - Villagio , Alsaad main signal , drive , after reaching the third signal , turn a U-TURN and u can find the clinic on the right hand side at the end of the road nearby the second signal , which you passed . QAR 100 is the charge and there is scanning facilities also .
Dr Khudsia Begum is a very nice doctor . Patient as well as understanding . the only problem in her clinic is the amount of people , hence you need to be prepared to wait for ur turn -LRB- and the wait can be anywhere between 15 minutes to 4 hours -RRB- .

look , i seems to be a quite fair offer specially if you are single you can save at least half of it if not more
you are blessed ! no tax here of any kind so you really are blessed !
not much , but for what job u r getting this salary depends ... ... since no details
<i> First of all : what kind of taxes do I have to pay for insurance -LRB- especially health insurance -RRB- </i> Make sure the company give you health insurance in your package . <i> and is there some kind of tax for the salary -LRB- income tax -RRB- as in Germany ? </i> Qatar is Tax Free , but check in Germany as to their rules for how long you need to be away to be exempt back home <i> What do you personally think about the income , especially if you like spending money =-RRB- </i> For someone your age that 's not bad . After food you will be saving most of that .
The package is good ... For a single person here ... since theres not much u can spend on unless someone is a shopping freak ...
It is good offer .
No taxes for the Salary , and health insurance will be on you company no way , because that 's a law , and I think that the offer is good
We got twice than what you got We save every month but not 50 % it is less than 50 %

If you have just moved to Qatar you will not be able to get a car unless you have your RP stamped , Qatar ID in hand , and a bank account that has at least your first month 's salary transferred into it -LRB- some banks require more than that -RRB- After you are done , the fun of buying a car starts ... get out there yourself and visit the showrooms , sit in the cars and see which one your arse likes better . Once you 've picked your car to your satisfaction ... then come on QL and post a topic asking everyone 's review about the car . : P

thanks for the advice
I suggest he/she secures a written approval or some evidence to testify his employer will release them . Another QLer posted that after he dropped the legal case he filed against his employer , who previously agreed to release him but did n't pay his dues , they turned against him and denied the agreement . Better be careful . Salam
Hi Fado Given the situation between a certain two countries I would not if I was you . I have heard of people being asked to leave Qatar within 48 hours after asking for a transfer . You should inquire with other people from your home country here and they can fill you in on it . Its politics again !
You may have the NOC on hands from your current sponsor , but the Immigration will not allows you to change your sponsor , when you did not completed a 1 full year work visa with the same sponsor . And working with another company not your sponsor is certainly illegal .
If I 'm working for 6 months to may current sponsor and i will resign with NOC -LRB- release paper from my sponsor -RRB- . As per advice to my next sponsor that i will exit to point of origin and they will just send the new visa & plane ticket this is possible ?
That is possible . But your visa should be cancelled by your sponsor and you need `` NOC to return within the 2yrs banned period '' . Note : NOC to transfer sponsor is different from NOC to return w/in 2yrs banned period .
who will provide the `` NOC to return within the 2 yrs banned period '' ? is it the sponsor or immigration . Tnx
Definitely , your current sponsor . : -RRB-
Did you experience this situation coz I discuss the issue of some HR-PRO the give me different answer the other one give me 95 % assurance that I will not be banned but other PRO give 100 % assurance that it will be ok to transfer to other sponsor . with this two different assurance one thing the are in common that I will exit to my country of origin and back here in Doha for new visa .
You will be banned for 2yrs once your RP is cancelled , which is why you need to reassure that your current employer will grant you an NOC to return . Please note that your RP must be cancelled prior to exit , otherwise your new employer wont be able to apply a new visa for you . Once you exit the State , and with an NOC on hands , things will be fine with you , in God 's will ! But changing sponsor within a year working of the same sponsor with a work visa/permanent visa stamped on your passport and without EXIT will not be possible for you as per Immigration Rules . You can double check with your company 's PRO , though .
Before or after a year , its difficult to grant you one , specially if your employer is Qatari . Be careful please . Salam
you will be able to change sponsorship within the first year . That was the answer I was given when I tried in 2004 even though the company were prepared to give me an NOC and I had another job and sponsor lined up .
Yes , it is possible . I have seen a guy , who changed after 8 months of his joining . In that case , 1 . THe first sponsor did give an NOC 2 . The second sponsr was a strong , reputed one In the abvoe criteria , it can be possible .
guys , no need to doubt it ! I HAVE CHANGED the sponsorship within 1 year . I PERSONALLY . As the matter of fact , my RP was just `` 5 month old '' at that time ... Apple , NOC is NOC . It means the previous sponsor does not mind you to work for another company . You can either transfer your sponsorship right away , even within 1 year , sometimes even without leaving qatar , or you can leave Qatar , to find another job and come back any time without waiting till 2 year ban is over . All the guy needs is NOC letter . And hey , it 's better not to belong to very few nationalities when as someone said , he might be asked to leave qatar within 48 hours . But this is a different story and has nothing to do with NOC , or duration of work with the previous sponsor . Some people try to just renew their RPs and asked to leave country . So get a NOC and good luck with your new job ! <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed .

QS , you are always special dahlin , no doubt on that ;-RRB- -RRB- Now I have this thoughts in mind , does the Law based on some nationalities too ? Because normally , like Dweller said , you can not made it possible w/in a yr . ? at least that 's what we 've been told .
Apple , someone asked me once : what are the immigration/labour rules in Qatar ? My answer was simple : Rule # 1 -LRB- and often the only 1 -RRB- : `` There are NO rules '' . What is perfectly working for one , irrespective of ones nationality , gender , age , religion , political preferences , etc. , might not working for another , irrespective of anothers nationality , gender ... see above :-RRB- ... Moreover , whatever worked for one person once , might not work for the same person next time -LRB- with the same name , same passport number , same nationality , same gender . . see above . . -RRB- So , when the questing starts from `` IS IT POSSIBLE ... ? '' , the answer is `` EVERYTHING is possible '' . And that was my point , dear :-RRB- how are you anyway ?

Oh ! very well dear , tnx for asking :-RRB- You seemingly right . It just appears to be the rules does n't really applies to everyone . But then , allow me to add one more rules here , that is sooo common . Rule # 2 `` Wasta '' : P
let 's do it
Came across several groups as such , but the initiators could n't conjure the energy to take it to the next step .
HGL , YOU have to build it . You ca n't just sit and wait until the nest is prepared for you . Unless , of course , this is your mentality . But then you would be the first WRONG member in this group .
Uncivilised way of talking on an initiative for a civilised group without understanding what is said ... dont know who would be a wrong member . Anyways , keep your smartness to yourself and do n't spoil a good initiative unless you have something positive to contribute .
lets make it work
Im IN ! : D
Join in minions !
The general QL members will suffer a huge loss if chose to leave them . .
Sign me up !
yeah me too . . my vote goes to nomercy . . to name a group ` civilized ' seems offensive and discriminating . .
Funny , so you mean it 's offensive to call the 21st century `` A civilized century '' ? Am I missing something ? And yes I do not think people shoving and forcing their own opinions unto others is civilized , therefore we are not interested in a group that contains such people . Hard to understand ?
@azilana `` It 's how they respond . . '' exactly , and that really betrays being civilized .
It 's their passion , strong belief/opinion and desire to sway the other parties to agree with them ... now THAT is worth discussing . : -RRB-
@azilana sometimes the `` discussing '' option is not available like in many countries such as Indonesia and Iraq during Saddam 's time . And some cases including Qatar , but Qatar and UAE are less strict than say Saudi Arabia .
their culture and beliefs ... and sticks to the topic , it 'll be a healthy discussion . It was possible before ... why ca n't it be now ? I guess the type of people who posted then and the ones currently active has different mindset . : -RRB-
Seriously this question is like , let 's say you Blosted I know your an athiest , and let 's say me I am religious , now here is a question we talk about a topic let 's say we talk about the big bang theory -LRB- not the TV Show XD -RRB- , my beliefs and your beliefs are going to crash , in which it would become uncivilized , so I think thier should be like a safe word or something were to end the discussion .
@gmz21 I 'm sorry but you ca n't mess around with the big bang theory , since it 's only one agreed upon theory . If you try to change some technical facts of the theory , everyone is happy as long as you got the evidence . But theories do not depend abou
I can not make out any head or tail of what goes on in kk show same as I couldnt make out anything about Big Boss and another reality show back home . The two reality shows back home mentioned were cheap , vulgar and may be thats what makes them popular . I do watch them once a while to keep myself aware of what these are all about .
Am in for that grOup !!
Well I was just reading the previous replies . It just seems we are starting it with a big kick in the behind . @nomerci , I guess yes we should put some guidelines , I 'd just hate being in the company of people who would just start throwing talks offensive to one 's intellect or humanity without any specific rational reason . @britexpat I ca n't seem to remember shoving any information without any evidence .
It would be more reasonable if we start a group in QL then start organizing get outs from then .
@Nomerci it just seems you have been watching too many posh movies ! Civilized means being human . And being Human is summed up by not being a a c * nt
What does big bang has to do with evolutionary biology ! Damn professional ninja thread hijackers ! Who love dogs !
yawn . . whats with the attitude dude . . why is someone here reacting constipated . . like a grade school adviser . . im watching Dawkins , hes really smart . . yawn ...
lol is that a pun ?
for sure . . wallah just take it easy dude . . civilized group mate . . civilized group . . yawn . . lets rest , have 20M QR waiting to be Bill tomorrow . . ciao . .
Oh ! I suddenly love you now ! tell me do you have 1M QR ? I need it for euh ... I forgot my wallet .
It sounds good , but whats the purpose ?? I mean being Civilized is a quality , not a common interest to form a group . If we really want to make a group ... lets find a common interest . A topic that inspires most of the people to participate . Though i like your intent ... I find it impractical . Best of Luck ! Cheers !
No one is argueing with with the Saddam issue we all know how bad he was , but you have to remind yourself what was the reason for the Iraq War , George W. Bush stated `` Weapons of Mass Destruction '' , but back then most Iraqis -LRB- again the people who lived in Iraq not American Soldiers or Media -RRB- , state it was safer to walk in the street at night , and now it 's unsafe to walk in the morning . Now yes Saddam did horrible things I should know I lived in Kuwait , I was born in Kuwait and I was barely 3 years when the Gulf War Invasion happened . So my parents tell me stories , and their families . But if you think it 's safer in Iraq now , your information is being biased that America did the best , thing they could .
@gmz21 no one is arguing that the Americans did a blow job , they always do , but at least now women got rights and girls and boys can finally get schooling . I mean it 's a start for a free society , but whatever it is I do n't think being threatened 24/
mutawa from both sides or only one side ?
@Xena I 'm also sick of people going around denying facts and trying to stuff in their own information with fallacious arguments that are in no way evidence based . Like people who think that Afghanistan or Iraq would have been better without western inte
I just ca n't get the `` culture and beliefs '' argument through ! I mean we were talking about how shoving things down one 's throat is not a fancy thing to do , and when it 's done you 'd just call it culture or belief ? Nonetheless that is certainly not a civilized thing to do .
Why do n't people get back to work and do something constructive rather than argue into cyberspace ???
@Stealth saying so just shows your ignorance about the fascist reign of Saddam Hussein which forces you to see your family while getting executed by shooting squad and still would force you to smile and clap with a big smile .
You know that a theory could be proven wrong by the tiniest thing why their called theory not facts , and that is false the most agreed Theory is the Pythagorean Theory which is still a theory . I never stated I do n't find the big bang theory incorrect you just began attacking man , I was using it as an example . Like if you want a civilized discussion you should try to understand both sides of the argument . Example would be the Iraq war you know what Iraqis say now , with Saddam their was safety but no freedom , but without Saddam we have freedom but no safety . This does n't mean that you 're wrong or that stealth is wrong , you are both right . You believe now they can vote and not be scared of their government officials . While Stealth believes now there is a very high rate of crime , which was n't around the time during Saddam 's time .
maybe the iraqis had so much pride in thmeselves that some western power was the one who got rid of saddam rather than themselves . by them i mean the same people fighting the americans now who happened to be the same people cowering in their houses when saddams cronies used to pass by . yep . that must be it . pride . same with the afghans i think .
Ignore what I have posted except the happy new year part , because 1 . I do n't feel like arguing 2 . If there is any chance of being friends i 'd rather not mess that up , because of some silly argument .
and the pot calling the kettle black ????
is it some kind like interest group ??
I do n't believe most conspiracy theories that arabs bring up . But I swear my American teacher made me believe the 9/11 conspiracy theory .
I agree with azilana , Attitude and making sure you are educated determines how civilized you are . Everyday you learn something new , hopefully we learn how to better co-exist and get along . Sign me up .
your sponsor will need to write a letter to the bank , listing the usuals , plus the amount of your salary . Then you take this letter to the bank , along with your residence permit , fill out the forms and you should get an account .
You need a letter from your sponsor - they should be telling you this !!!
A few years ago I was on visit visa , and I was able to open up a savings account . The bank just asked for my passport and took copy of my visa stamp page . I got an ATM card but no cheque book . This was with Doha bank . Try smaller less busy branches and speak to a customer services person and discuss your options with them .

What 's a casual position ??
1 riyal basic and 2 riyals for overtime ... yes too much : -RRB-
Sitting in a chair , or even better , lying on a bed . Very casual .
Casualty position in Dukhan
Shirt , jeans and shoes ... No tie , suit ...
Maybe you do n't know what is casualty so you better keep your idea and do n't give a non sense comments
Salary is n't really the right word . As I understand , Casual Hire Contract rates are calculated by the day . Daily rate is a combination of basic and allowances , these depend where you work etc. . I do n't know if the rates and conditions vary according to posts though .

very strange , even infants know about super glue !!!! Go again to any grocery and ask the same qn.u 'll get it within a second.Normally It hangs just above the cashier 's counter .
are you sure you didnt find ... any grocery ...
U can buy it at any little supermarket . It usually comes on large strips , and is a black and orangr tube , approx QR3 ,
lol . . You can call it `` Super Glue '' . Just go to one of those small grocery stores and ask them . Usually all of them have it . If not , you can try some hardware store in the musherib area . But the quantity will be much more than the `` Super Glue ''

U HAVE TO WAIT 4 2DAYS
u won 500 QR Qatar traffic violation . .
The yellow sticker is a parking fine worth QR500 and 3 points on your licence .
yellow sticker is a parking ticket . There are different fines depending on what the officer thinks your offense is The fine ranges from 300 to 6,000 ! Yes , that 's not a typo . I took mine to the City center mall , bottom floor Ministry of Interior kiosk . Gave it to the nice man , along with my license and registration . He asked for my bank card , swiped it and I paid 300QR fine and got 3 points . All because I parked in a dirt lot . shame on me !
welcome to the club ...
Congratulations on accomplishing a Qrs . 500 / - traffic violation ... pay the due before your next istamara ... and wait for 1 week for it to appear on the website ...
Sound the winning bell ! You have just won a parking violation from the police ! It 'll cost you between 300 / - QR and 500 / - QR ... depends on what kind of parking violation committed . Take care of it immediately and be careful not to get anymore . It 'll knock 3 points off of your driver 's license and you only have 12 points on there . So now you have 9 points . If you hit 12 points , they 'll revoke your license anywhere from 6 months to a year . Sucks , I know .
QL !

try to get closer to the access point -LRB- WiFi access point -RRB- as PDAs are not that adept as laptops in collecting signals . . if this does n't work , there could be a problem in your settings or your PDAs wifi capability is busted ... have a nice day . . <aÂ href=http://s6.photobucket.com/albums/y242/dheng0112/?action=view&current=blackbeardsignature.jpgÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y242/dheng0112/blackbeardsignature.jpgÂ border=0Â alt=blackbeardÂ signature> </a>

what kind of router are you using btw ? Can you check the IP range that your Router DHCP server -LSB- if it 's working -RSB- is assigning to the clients ? If you know the range , just try assigning your wireless connection on the PDA a static IP Address . The DHCP on the router might be disabled ... Do not dwell in the past , do not dream of the future , concentrate the mind on the present moment . <strong> -LRB- Gautama Buddha -RRB- </strong>
I am using linksys router . . i tried to assign static ip but it dint workat all . . and yes DHCP is disable on the router ...
that is the thing ... It 's either you will enable DHCP or assign the following IP to your PDA assuming the the subnet on your linksys is the default : <aÂ href=http://img233.imageshack.us/my.php?image=iptg4.jpgÂ target=_blank> <imgÂ src=http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/8915/iptg4.th.jpgÂ border=0Â alt=FreeÂ ImageÂ HostingÂ atÂ www.ImageShack.usÂ /> </a> <brÂ /> <brÂ /> <aÂ href=http://img604.imageshack.us/content.php?page=blogpost&files=img233/8915/iptg4.jpgÂ title=QuickPost> </a> Hope that would help ...

you can hard reset your wireless router by pressing the small button at the back with a paper clip , BUT YOU WILL NEED TO RE-CONFIGURE THE ROUTER - anyway its just username and password for the ADSL setting you just have to obtain that information before doing the hard reset . <aÂ title=EverythingÂ youÂ needÂ toÂ knowÂ aboutÂ livingÂ inÂ Doha,Â QatarÂ href=http://www.qatarliving.com> <imgÂ src=http://static.qatarliving.com/badges/150x50_ql_glass_badge.gifÂ alt=EverythingÂ youÂ needÂ toÂ knowÂ aboutÂ livingÂ inÂ Doha,Â QatarÂ /> </a>
plumkiwi i dont think there is any problem with the router coz i am using same connection on ma laptop with the same security settings ... wot d u saY ?
i didnt say there is problem with the router . its with the security maybe your pda doesnt authenticate with security encryption better disable it first to verify . or better yet try changing your security mode to `` WEP '' encryption `` 10/64-bits '' . <aÂ title=EverythingÂ youÂ needÂ toÂ knowÂ aboutÂ livingÂ inÂ Doha,Â QatarÂ href=http://www.qatarliving.com> <imgÂ src=http://static.qatarliving.com/badges/150x50_ql_glass_badge.gifÂ alt=EverythingÂ youÂ needÂ toÂ knowÂ aboutÂ livingÂ inÂ Doha,Â QatarÂ /> </a>
